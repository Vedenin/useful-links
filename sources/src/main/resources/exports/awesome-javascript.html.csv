If you're willing to help, please say hello to team@bower.io or donate Bower offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat. Bower runs over Git, and is package-agnostic. A packaged component can be made up of any type of asset, and use any type of transport (e.g., AMD, CommonJS, etc.). View complete docs on bower.io View all packages available through Bower's registry. Install $ npm install -g bower Bower depends on Node.js and npm. Also make sure that git is installed as some bower packages require it to be fetched and installed. Usage See complete command line reference at bower.io/docs/api/ Installing packages and dependencies # install dependencies listed in bower.json $ bower install  # install a package and add it to bower.json $ bower install <package> --save  # install specific version of a package and add it to bower.json $ bower install <package>#<version> --save Using packages We discourage using bower components statically for performance and security reasons (if component has an upload.php file that is not ignored, that can be easily exploited to do malicious stuff). The best approach is to process components installed by bower with build tool (like Grunt or gulp), and serve them concatenated or using a module loader (like RequireJS). Uninstalling packages To uninstall a locally installed package: $ bower uninstall <package-name> prezto and oh-my-zsh users On prezto or oh-my-zsh, do not forget to alias bower='noglob bower' or bower install jquery\#1.9.1 Never run Bower with sudo Bower is a user command; there is no need to execute it with superuser permissions. Windows users To use Bower on Windows, you must install Git for Windows correctly. Be sure to check the options shown below: Note that if you use TortoiseGit and if Bower keeps asking for your SSH password, you should add the following environment variable: GIT_SSH - C:\Program Files\TortoiseGit\bin\TortoisePlink.exe. Adjust the TortoisePlink path if needed. Ubuntu users To use Bower on Ubuntu, you might need to link nodejs executable to node: sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node  Configuration Bower can be configured using JSON in a .bowerrc file. Read over available options at bower.io/docs/config. Support Discord chat StackOverflow Mailinglist - twitter-bower@googlegroups.com Contributing We welcome contributions of all kinds from anyone.

See here #639 for more information. You can stil use the component registry on component.github.io to search for components. All the components are not affected, because most of them also provide a package.json file. The component.json files in these components are still kept to provide backwards compatibility for component and duo. What now? Consider to use another tool, which rely on the npm and the package.json standard: webpack jspm (supports npm and github endpoint) browserify Component is a vertically integrated frontend solution, handling everything from package management to the build process, handling everything including HTML, JS, CSS, images, and fonts. Think of it as an opinionated npm + browserify + rework-npm + grunt/gulp/broccoli all wrapped into component build. Want to know more about Component? Visit the guide or view the comparison with other solutions. If you're confused about component, components, componentjs, please read disambiguation Component 1.0.0: Several major new features have been added, some have been removed, and the project has been greatly reorganized. You may need to upgrade your version of node and/or npm to avoid breakage. Please see the detailed changelog. Component 0.x will not be maintained anymore. Installation First, you need node v0.10+ installed. If you do not have it installed, visit node's download page. With node installed, run the following command:  $ npm install -g component  Getting Started Read this Getting Started guide to get a basic static site running very quickly with Component. Note: the Component repo (this repo) has only documentation for Component 0.19. All of the documentation related to 1.0.0 will be handled in the guide repo. Team The team and organization have undergone massive changes. In summary, jonathanong stopped developing Component and started with normalize.io and the guys from segmentio switched to using duo. Component will still be maintained and updated while it is in use. You can read more about Duo.js and Component here. The long story of Component and the changes that occurred in component can be found in Jonathan Ong's blog post ""the future of component"". Development for component (maintenance and features) will be continued at the latest when latest browsers will support the ES6 modules and Web Components natively.

Unlike other repositories, we put the browser first. Manage dependencies - Using a stack of script tags isn't the most maintainable way of managing dependencies, with Jam packages and loaders like RequireJS you get automatic dependency resolution. Fast and modular - Achieve faster load times with asynchronous loading and the ability to optimize downloads. JavaScript modules and packages provide properly namespaced and more modular code. Use with existing stack - Jam manages only your front-end assets, the rest of your app can be written in your favourite language or framework. Node.js tools can use the repository directly with the Jam API. Custom builds - No more configuring custom builds of popular libraries. Now, every build can be optimized automatically depending on the parts you use, and additional components can always be loaded later. Focus on size - Installing multiple versions works great on the server, but client-side we don't want five versions of jQuery! Jam can use powerful dependency resolution to find a working set of packages using only a single version of each. 100% browser - Every package you see here will work in the browser and play nicely with module loaders like RequireJS. We're not hijacking an existing repository, we're creating a 100% browser-focused community! Visit the Jam website Example usage $ jam install jquery  <script src=""jam/require.js""></script>  <script>     require(['jquery'], function ($) {         ...     }); </script> Learn more... Browser packages in package.json You can also define your browser dependencies in a project-level package.json file. If you use Node.js, this format will already familiar to you, and the Jam dependencies can live alongside your NPM dependencies. It's also possible to define custom install paths and baseUrls, as well as hand in any requirejs configuration here: {     ""name"": ""my-project"",     ""version"": ""0.0.1"",     ""description"": ""My example project"",     ""jam"": {         ""baseUrl"": ""public"",         ""packageDir"": ""public/vendor"",         ""dependencies"": {             ""jquery"": ""1.7.x"",             ""underscore"": null         },         ""config"": {           ""paths"": {             ""templates"": ""public/templates""           }         }     } } Installation # npm install -g jamjs  Requires node.js Settings You can customize Jam by creating a .jamrc file in your home directory. .jamrc repositories An array with Jam repositiories. Jam uses http://jamjs.org/repository by default, but it's possible to create a local, e.g. corporate, repository. exports.repositories = [     ""http://mycorporation.com:5984/repository/"",     ""http://jamjs.org/repository"" ]; Repositories are in preference-order, so packages from repositories earlier in the list will be preferred over packages in repositories later in the list. However, when no package version is specified, the highest version number will be installed (even if that's not from the earliest repository). You can add custom search URLs to repositories too: exports.repositories = [     {         url: ""http://mycorporation.com:5984/repository/"",         search: ""http://db.com:5984/_fti/key/_design/search/something""     },     ""http://jamjs.org/repository"" ]; If your local repository doesn't implement full text search (e.g. you don't want to install couchdb lucene), you can disable searching functionality for that repository, otherwise jam search would report an error: exports.repositories = [     {         url: ""http://mycorporation.com:5984/repository/"",         search: false     },     ""http://jamjs.org/repository"" ]; See the section below on running your own repository. package_dir Sets the default package installation directory (normally uses ./jam). This is best customized in your project-level package.json file, to ensure other developers also install to the correct location. exports.package_dir = 'libs'; Running the tests Jam includes two test suites, unit tests (in test/unit) and integration tests (in test/integration). The unit tests are easy to run by running the test/unit.sh script, or test\unit.bat on Windows. The integration tests first require you to set up a CouchDB instance to test against (you can get a free account at IrisCouch if you don't want to install CouchDB). You then need to set the JAM_TEST_DB environment variable to point to a CouchDB database URL for testing: Linux export JAM_TEST_DB=http://user:password@localhost:5984/jamtest  Windows set JAM_TEST_DB=http://user:password@localhost:5984/jamtest  Warning: All data in the test database will be deleted! You can then run the integration tests using test/integration.sh or test\integration.bat. To run BOTH the unit and integration tests use test/all.sh or test\all.bat. Running your own private repository or mirror Install couchdb Mac OS X: 1.

Supports installing any module format from any registry, with GitHub and npm currently provided, via the registry API. Couples to the SystemJS module loader, which is built on the current draft of the browser ES6 module loader specification. Carefully resolves version ranges using greedy fork minimization into flat multi-version package folders. Provides tiered bundling of multi-format module trees using SystemJS builder. Loads and builds assets through SystemJS plugins. See https://jspm.io for a project overview. For support, join the Gitter room or Google Group.

We like to think of it as NPM's little sister. Ender is not a JavaScript library It's not a jQuery replacement. It's not even a static asset. It's a tool for making the consumption of front-end JavaScript packages dead simple and incredibly powerful. WHY? In the browser - small, loosely coupled modules are the future and large, tightly-bound monolithic libraries are the past! Ender capitalizes on this by offering a unique way to bring together the exciting work happening in JavaScript packages and allows you to mix, match, and customize your own build, suited to your individual needs, without all the extra cruft that comes with larger libraries. With Ender, if one library goes bad or unmaintained, it can be replaced with another. Need a specific package version? No problem! Does your package have dependencies? Let us handle that for you too!

Once your project is set up, automate common tasks. volo is dependency manager and project creation tool that favors GitHub for the package repository. At its heart, volo is a generic command runner -- you can create new commands for volo, and you can use commands others have created. By default, volo knows how to: create a new web project add scripts for a web project from the command line automate project actions via volofiles and reusable volo commands Prerequisites Node 0.6.5 or later installed. If you are using Ubuntu, then you may need to apt-get install nodejs-legacy too. Install volo requires Node to run. Node includes npm, a package manager for node code. To install volo: npm install -g volo  If you get an error when running that command, and it contains this line somwhere in it: npm ERR! Please try running this command again as root/Administrator.  You will need to run the install via sudo: sudo npm install -g volo  Usage volo can use GitHub to retrieve code, so one of the core concepts when using it is understanding user/repo for archive names. See the add doc for more info on the types of archive names to use. AMD project example To set up an AMD/RequireJS-based project called fast that uses AMD versions of Backbone, jQuery and underscore: > volo create fast (uses [volojs/create-template](https://github.com/volojs/create-template) for project template) > cd fast > volo add jquery (uses jquery/jquery as the repo) > volo add underscore (uses amdjs/underscore as repo since an AMD project) > volo add backbone (uses amdjs/backbone as repo since an AMD project)  Then modify www/js/app.js to require the modules you need and add your app logic. The above example uses the amdjs/underscore and amdjs/backbone versions of those libraries, which include integrated AMD support. Browser globals project example To set up an HTML5 Boilerplate project that does not use AMD/RequireJS, but does use documentcloud repos of Backbone and Underscore (the Boilerplate already has jQuery): > volo create html5fast html5-boilerplate (pulls down latest tag of that repo) > cd html5fast > volo add underscore (uses documentcloud/underscore as repo) > volo add backbone (uses documentcloud/backbone as repo)  Updating a previously added library There is no ""update"" command in Volo. However, updating a library is simple: > volo add -f underscore  This will delete your local copy of underscore and then re-add underscore. Library Best Practices To work well with volo, here are some tips on how to structure your library code: Library Best Practices Details Design goals Prior Art: npm, cpm, bpm.

It is optimized for in-browser use, including in a Web Worker, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node. It implements the Asynchronous Module API. RequireJS uses plain script tags to load modules/files, so it should allow for easy debugging. It can be used simply to load existing JavaScript files, so you can add it to your existing project without having to re-write your JavaScript files. RequireJS includes an optimization tool you can run as part of your packaging steps for deploying your code. The optimization tool can combine and minify your JavaScript files to allow for better performance. If the JavaScript file defines a JavaScript module via define(), then there are other benefits RequireJS can offer: improvements over traditional CommonJS modules and loading multiple versions of a module in a page. RequireJS also has a plugin system that supports features like i18n string bundles, and text file dependencies. RequireJS does not have any dependencies on a JavaScript framework. RequireJS works in IE 6+, Firefox 2+, Safari 3.2+, Chrome 3+, and Opera 10+. Latest Release License MIT Code of Conduct jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct. Directories dist: Scripts and assets to generate the requirejs.org docs, and for generating a require.js release. docs: The raw HTML files for the requirejs.org docs.

Check out browserify search to find browserify-compatible packages on npm. example Whip up a file, main.js with some require()s in it. You can use relative paths like './foo.js' and '../lib/bar.js' or module paths like 'gamma' that will search node_modules/ using node's module lookup algorithm. var foo = require('./foo.js'); var bar = require('../lib/bar.js'); var gamma = require('gamma');  var elem = document.getElementById('result'); var x = foo(100) + bar('baz'); elem.textContent = gamma(x); Export functionality by assigning onto module.exports or exports: module.exports = function (n) { return n * 111 } Now just use the browserify command to build a bundle starting at main.js: $ browserify main.js > bundle.js  All of the modules that main.js needs are included in the bundle.js from a recursive walk of the require() graph using required. To use this bundle, just toss a <script src=""bundle.js""></script> into your html! install With npm do: npm install -g browserify  usage Usage: browserify [entry files] {OPTIONS}  Standard Options:      --outfile, -o  Write the browserify bundle to this file.                    If unspecified, browserify prints to stdout.      --require, -r  A module name or file to bundle.require()                    Optionally use a colon separator to set the target.        --entry, -e  An entry point of your app       --ignore, -i  Replace a file with an empty stub. Files can be globs.      --exclude, -u  Omit a file from the output bundle. Files can be globs.     --external, -x  Reference a file from another bundle. Files can be globs.    --transform, -t  Use a transform module on top-level files.      --command, -c  Use a transform command on top-level files.    --standalone -s  Generate a UMD bundle for the supplied export name.                    This bundle works with other module systems and sets the name                    given as a window global if no module system is found.         --debug -d  Enable source maps that allow you to debug your files                    separately.         --help, -h  Show this message  For advanced options, type `browserify --help advanced`.  Specify a parameter.  Advanced Options:    --insert-globals, --ig, --fast    [default: false]      Skip detection and always insert definitions for process, global,     __filename, and __dirname.      benefit: faster builds     cost: extra bytes    --insert-global-vars, --igv      Comma-separated list of global variables to detect and define.     Default: __filename,__dirname,process,Buffer,global    --detect-globals, --dg            [default: true]      Detect the presence of process, global, __filename, and __dirname and define     these values when present.      benefit: npm modules more likely to work     cost: slower builds    --ignore-missing, --im            [default: false]      Ignore `require()` statements that don't resolve to anything.    --noparse=FILE      Don't parse FILE at all. This will make bundling much, much faster for giant     libs like jquery or threejs.    --no-builtins      Turn off builtins. This is handy when you want to run a bundle in node which     provides the core builtins.    --no-commondir      Turn off setting a commondir. This is useful if you want to preserve the     original paths that a bundle was generated with.    --no-bundle-external      Turn off bundling of all external modules. This is useful if you only want     to bundle your local files.    --bare      Alias for both --no-builtins, --no-commondir, and sets --insert-global-vars     to just ""__filename,__dirname"". This is handy if you want to run bundles in     node.    --no-browser-field, --no-bf      Turn off package.json browser field resolution. This is also handy if you     need to run a bundle in node.    --node      Alias for --bare and --no-browser-field.    --full-paths      Turn off converting module ids into numerical indexes. This is useful for     preserving the original paths that a bundle was generated with.    --deps      Instead of standard bundle output, print the dependency array generated by     module-deps.    --list      Print each file in the dependency graph. Useful for makefiles.    --extension=EXTENSION      Consider files with specified EXTENSION as modules, this option can used     multiple times.    --global-transform=MODULE, -g MODULE      Use a transform module on all files after any ordinary transforms have run.    --ignore-transform=MODULE, -it MODULE      Do not run certain transformations, even if specified elsewhere.    --plugin=MODULE, -p MODULE      Register MODULE as a plugin.  Passing arguments to transforms and plugins:    For -t, -g, and -p, you may use subarg syntax to pass options to the   transforms or plugin function as the second parameter. For example:      -t [ foo -x 3 --beep ]    will call the `foo` transform for each applicable file by calling:      foo(file, { x: 3, beep: true })   compatibility Many npm modules that don't do IO will just work after being browserified. Others take more work. Many node built-in modules have been wrapped to work in the browser, but only when you explicitly require() or use their functionality. When you require() any of these modules, you will get a browser-specific shim: assert buffer console constants crypto domain events http https os path punycode querystring stream string_decoder timers tty url util vm zlib Additionally, if you use any of these variables, they will be defined in the bundled output in a browser-appropriate way: process Buffer global - top-level scope object (window) __filename - file path of the currently executing file __dirname - directory path of the currently executing file more examples external requires You can just as easily create a bundle that will export a require() function so you can require() modules from another script tag. Here we'll create a bundle.js with the through and duplexer modules. $ browserify -r through -r duplexer -r ./my-file.js:my-module > bundle.js  Then in your page you can do: <script src=""bundle.js""></script> <script>   var through = require('through');   var duplexer = require('duplexer');   var myModule = require('my-module');   /* ... */ </script> external source maps If you prefer the source maps be saved to a separate .js.map source map file, you may use exorcist in order to achieve that. It's as simple as: $ browserify main.js --debug | exorcist bundle.js.map > bundle.js  Learn about additional options here. multiple bundles If browserify finds a required function already defined in the page scope, it will fall back to that function if it didn't find any matches in its own set of bundled modules. In this way, you can use browserify to split up bundles among multiple pages to get the benefit of caching for shared, infrequently-changing modules, while still being able to use require(). Just use a combination of --external and --require to factor out common dependencies. For example, if a website with 2 pages, beep.js: var robot = require('./robot.js'); console.log(robot('beep')); and boop.js: var robot = require('./robot.js'); console.log(robot('boop')); both depend on robot.js: module.exports = function (s) { return s.toUpperCase() + '!' }; $ browserify -r ./robot.js > static/common.js $ browserify -x ./robot.js beep.js > static/beep.js $ browserify -x ./robot.js boop.js > static/boop.js  Then on the beep page you can have: <script src=""common.js""></script> <script src=""beep.js""></script> while the boop page can have: <script src=""common.js""></script> <script src=""boop.js""></script> This approach using -r and -x works fine for a small number of split assets, but there are plugins for automatically factoring out components which are described in the partitioning section of the browserify handbook. api example You can use the API directly too: var browserify = require('browserify'); var b = browserify(); b.add('./browser/main.js'); b.bundle().pipe(process.stdout); methods var browserify = require('browserify') browserify([files] [, opts]) Returns a new browserify instance. files String, file object, or array of those types (they may be mixed) specifying entry file(s). opts Object. files and opts are both optional, but must be in the order shown if both are passed. Entry files may be passed in files and / or opts.entries. External requires may be specified in opts.require, accepting the same formats that the files argument does. If an entry file is a stream, its contents will be used. You should pass opts.basedir when using streaming files so that relative requires can be resolved. opts.entries has the same definition as files. opts.noParse is an array which will skip all require() and global parsing for each file in the array. Use this for giant libs like jquery or threejs that don't have any requires or node-style globals but take forever to parse. opts.transform is an array of transform functions or modules names which will transform the source code before the parsing. opts.ignoreTransform is an array of transformations that will not be run, even if specified elsewhere. opts.plugin is an array of plugin functions or module names to use. See the plugins section below for details. opts.extensions is an array of optional extra extensions for the module lookup machinery to use when the extension has not been specified. By default browserify considers only .js and .json files in such cases. opts.basedir is the directory that browserify starts bundling from for filenames that start with .. opts.paths is an array of directories that browserify searches when looking for modules which are not referenced using relative path. Can be absolute or relative to basedir. Equivalent of setting NODE_PATH environmental variable when calling browserify command. opts.commondir sets the algorithm used to parse out the common paths. Use false to turn this off, otherwise it uses the commondir module. opts.fullPaths disables converting module ids into numerical indexes. This is useful for preserving the original paths that a bundle was generated with. opts.builtins sets the list of built-ins to use, which by default is set in lib/builtins.js in this distribution. opts.bundleExternal boolean option to set if external modules should be bundled. Defaults to true. When opts.browserField is false, the package.json browser field will be ignored. When opts.insertGlobals is true, always insert process, global, __filename, and __dirname without analyzing the AST for faster builds but larger output bundles. Default false. When opts.detectGlobals is true, scan all files for process, global, __filename, and __dirname, defining as necessary. With this option npm modules are more likely to work but bundling takes longer. Default true. When opts.debug is true, add a source map inline to the end of the bundle. This makes debugging easier because you can see all the original files if you are in a modern enough browser. When opts.standalone is a non-empty string, a standalone module is created with that name and a umd wrapper. You can use namespaces in the standalone global export using a . in the string name as a separator, for example 'A.B.C'. The global export will be sanitized and camel cased. Note that in standalone mode the require() calls from the original source will still be around, which may trip up AMD loaders scanning for require() calls. You can remove these calls with derequire: $ npm install -g derequire $ browserify main.js --standalone Foo | derequire > bundle.js  opts.insertGlobalVars will be passed to insert-module-globals as the opts.vars parameter. opts.externalRequireName defaults to 'require' in expose mode but you can use another name. Note that if files do not contain javascript source code then you also need to specify a corresponding transform for them. All other options are forwarded along to module-deps and browser-pack directly. b.add(file, opts) Add an entry file from file that will be executed when the bundle loads. If file is an array, each item in file will be added as an entry file. b.require(file, opts) Make file available from outside the bundle with require(file). The file param is anything that can be resolved by require.resolve(). file can also be a stream, but you should also use opts.basedir so that relative requires will be resolvable. If file is an array, each item in file will be required. In file array form, you can use a string or object for each item. Object items should have a file property and the rest of the parameters will be used for the opts. Use the expose property of opts to specify a custom dependency name. require('./vendor/angular/angular.js', {expose: 'angular'}) enables require('angular') b.bundle(cb) Bundle the files and their dependencies into a single javascript file. Return a readable stream with the javascript file contents or optionally specify a cb(err, buf) to get the buffered results. b.external(file) Prevent file from being loaded into the current bundle, instead referencing from another bundle. If file is an array, each item in file will be externalized. If file is another bundle, that bundle's contents will be read and excluded from the current bundle as the bundle in file gets bundled. b.ignore(file) Prevent the module name or file at file from showing up in the output bundle. Instead you will get a file with module.exports = {}. b.exclude(file) Prevent the module name or file at file from showing up in the output bundle. If your code tries to require() that file it will throw unless you've provided another mechanism for loading it. b.transform(tr, opts={}) Transform source code before parsing it for require() calls with the transform function or module name tr. If tr is a function, it will be called with tr(file) and it should return a through-stream that takes the raw file contents and produces the transformed source. If tr is a string, it should be a module name or file path of a transform module with a signature of: var through = require('through'); module.exports = function (file) { return through() }; You don't need to necessarily use the through module. Browserify is compatible with the newer, more verbose Transform streams built into Node v0.10. Here's how you might compile coffee script on the fly using .transform(): var coffee = require('coffee-script'); var through = require('through');  b.transform(function (file) {     var data = '';     return through(write, end);      function write (buf) { data += buf }     function end () {         this.queue(coffee.compile(data));         this.queue(null);     } }); Note that on the command-line with the -c flag you can just do: $ browserify -c 'coffee -sc' main.coffee > bundle.js  Or better still, use the coffeeify module: $ npm install coffeeify $ browserify -t coffeeify main.coffee > bundle.js  If opts.global is true, the transform will operate on ALL files, despite whether they exist up a level in a node_modules/ directory. Use global transforms cautiously and sparingly, since most of the time an ordinary transform will suffice. You can also not configure global transforms in a package.json like you can with ordinary transforms. Global transforms always run after any ordinary transforms have run. Transforms may obtain options from the command-line with subarg syntax: $ browserify -t [ foo --bar=555 ] main.js  or from the api: b.transform('foo', { bar: 555 })  In both cases, these options are provided as the second argument to the transform function: module.exports = function (file, opts) { /* opts.bar === 555 */ }  Options sent to the browserify constructor are also provided under opts._flags. These browserify options are sometimes required if your transform needs to do something different when browserify is run in debug mode, for example. b.plugin(plugin, opts) Register a plugin with opts. Plugins can be a string module name or a function the same as transforms. plugin(b, opts) is called with the browserify instance b. For more information, consult the plugins section below. b.pipeline There is an internal labeled-stream-splicer pipeline with these labels: 'record' - save inputs to play back later on subsequent bundle() calls 'deps' - module-deps 'json' - adds module.exports= to the beginning of json files 'unbom' - remove byte-order markers 'unshebang' - remove #! labels on the first line 'syntax' - check for syntax errors 'sort' - sort the dependencies for deterministic bundles 'dedupe' - remove duplicate source contents 'label' - apply integer labels to files 'emit-deps' - emit 'dep' event 'debug' - apply source maps 'pack' - browser-pack 'wrap' - apply final wrapping, require= and a newline and semicolon You can call b.pipeline.get() with a label name to get a handle on a stream pipeline that you can push(), unshift(), or splice() to insert your own transform streams. b.reset(opts) Reset the pipeline back to a normal state. This function is called automatically when bundle() is called multiple times. This function triggers a 'reset' event. package.json browserify uses the package.json in its module resolution algorithm, just like node. If there is a ""main"" field, browserify will start resolving the package at that point. If there is no ""main"" field, browserify will look for an ""index.js"" file in the module root directory. Here are some more sophisticated things you can do in the package.json: browser field There is a special ""browser"" field you can set in your package.json on a per-module basis to override file resolution for browser-specific versions of files. For example, if you want to have a browser-specific module entry point for your ""main"" field you can just set the ""browser"" field to a string: ""browser"": ""./browser.js"" or you can have overrides on a per-file basis: ""browser"": {   ""fs"": ""level-fs"",   ""./lib/ops.js"": ""./browser/opts.js"" } Note that the browser field only applies to files in the local module, and like transforms, it doesn't apply into node_modules directories. browserify.transform You can specify source transforms in the package.json in the browserify.transform field. There is more information about how source transforms work in package.json on the module-deps readme. For example, if your module requires brfs, you can add ""browserify"": { ""transform"": [ ""brfs"" ] } to your package.json. Now when somebody require()s your module, brfs will automatically be applied to the files in your module without explicit intervention by the person using your module. Make sure to add transforms to your package.json dependencies field. events b.on('file', function (file, id, parent) {}) b.pipeline.on('file', function (file, id, parent) {}) When a file is resolved for the bundle, the bundle emits a 'file' event with the full file path, the id string passed to require(), and the parent object used by browser-resolve. You could use the file event to implement a file watcher to regenerate bundles when files change. b.on('package', function (pkg) {}) b.pipeline.on('package', function (pkg) {}) When a package file is read, this event fires with the contents. The package directory is available at pkg.__dirname. b.on('bundle', function (bundle) {}) When .bundle() is called, this event fires with the bundle output stream. b.on('reset', function () {}) When the .reset() method is called or implicitly called by another call to .bundle(), this event fires. b.on('transform', function (tr, file) {}) b.pipeline.on('transform', function (tr, file) {}) When a transform is applied to a file, the 'transform' event fires on the bundle stream with the transform stream tr and the file that the transform is being applied to. plugins For some more advanced use-cases, a transform is not sufficiently extensible. Plugins are modules that take the bundle instance as their first parameter and an option hash as their second. Plugins can be used to do perform some fancy features that transforms can't do. For example, factor-bundle is a plugin that can factor out common dependencies from multiple entry-points into a common bundle. Use plugins with -p and pass options to plugins with subarg syntax: browserify x.js y.js -p [ factor-bundle -o bundle/x.js -o bundle/y.js ] \   > bundle/common.js  For a list of plugins, consult the browserify-plugin tag on npm. list of source transforms There is a wiki page that lists the known browserify transforms. If you write a transform, make sure to add your transform to that wiki page and add a package.json keyword of browserify-transform so that people can browse for all the browserify transforms on npmjs.org. third-party tools There is a wiki page that lists the known browserify tools. If you write a tool, make sure to add it to that wiki page and add a package.json keyword of browserify-tool so that people can browse for all the browserify tools on npmjs.org. changelog Releases are documented in changelog.markdown and on the browserify twitter feed. license MIT Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Jan 19, 2016 README.md curl (cujoJS resource loader) All development for curl.js and cram.js has stopped. For the foreseeable future, we will continue to respond to issues on github, as well as in the #cujojs room on freenode. However, keep in mind that there will be no further development, so some issues might not be resolved fully. Also, if you are interested in becoming the lead maintainer of curl.js and/or cram.js, please let us know on #cujojs! What is curl.js? curl.js is a small and very fast AMD-compliant asynchronous loader. Size: ~4KB (gzipped) using Google's Closure Compiler. If you'd like to use curl.js for non-AMD modules (ordinary javascript files), you'll want to use the legacy loader. curl.js, like all async loaders, cannot circumvent browsers' security restrictions when using the file: protocol. Therefore, you must use curl from a page served from a web server (i.e. using http: or https:). Trying to run curl.js from a page loaded from your local file system will not work correctly in all browsers. What the heck is ""cujoJS""? cujoJS is the JavaScript Architectural Toolkit. More info: cujojs.com What is ""cram""? cram (cujoJS resource assembler) is the build tool companion to curl.js. You use cram to compile all of your modules into a small number of javascript files which are loaded much faster into the browsers. Features at a glance: Loads AMD-formatted javascript modules in parallel Loads CommonJS/node modules (v1.1 when wrapped in a define()) Loads CommonJS/node modules (unwrapped when using the cjsm11 loader) Loads non-AMD javascript files in parallel, too. Loads CSS files and text files in parallel Waits for dependencies (js, css, text, etc) before executing javascript Waits for domReady, if desired Allows for virtually limitless combinations of files and dependencies Tested with Safari 5+, IE6+, and recent Chrome, FF, Opera More detailed information below and on the wiki. How to get support Go to the issues section of the curl repo (https://github.com/cujojs/curl/issues) and search for an answer to your question or problem. If no answer exists, file a new ticket! Somebody will typically respond within a few hours. It's that easy. Got more in-depth questions? Browse the cujoJS discussion group or come chat with us on freenode @ #cujojs. See the wiki for information about using curl.js with jQuery, dojo, or underscore. What's New? 0.8.12 Add deprecation notice. Add links to Rave Starters.

Cram plugins: legacy loader no longer fails to add a .js extension when there are dots in the file name. API at a glance At it's core, curl.js provides an AMD environment: define(['dep1', 'dep2', 'dep3' /* etc */], factory); define(['dep1', 'dep2', 'dep3' /* etc */], module); define(module); define(name, ['dep1', 'dep2', 'dep3' /* etc */], factory); define(name, ['dep1', 'dep2', 'dep3' /* etc */], module); define(name, module); These all define a module per the AMD specification. ['dep1', 'dep2', 'dep3']: Module names or plugin-prefixed resource files. Dependencies may be named 'require', 'exports', or 'module' and will behave as defined in the CommonJS Modules 1.1 proposal. factory: Function called to define the module. Each dependency is passed as a parameter to the factory. module: Any javascript object, function, constructor, or primitive name: String used to name a module. This is not necessary nor is it recommended. ""Named modules"" are typically only created by build tools and AMD bundlers. define(function (require, exports, module) {     var dep1 = require('app/foo');     exports.foo2 = function () { return foo() + 2; }; }); Defines a module using the AMD-wrapped-CommonJS format. If a factory function has parameters, but the dependency list is missing, this format is assumed. The exports and module parameters are optional, but when specified, must be in this exact order. define(function (require) {     var dep1 = require('app/foo');     return function () { return foo() + 2; }; }); Another variation on AMD-wrapped-CommonJS that uses require() in the tidy CommonJS manner, but returns the exports as per typical AMD. define(['require', 'exports', 'module'], function (require, exports, module) {     var dep1 = require('app/foo');     exports.foo2 = function () { return foo() + 2; }; }); Another way to gain access to the CommonJS-like variables, require, exports, module. When specified in the dependency list, these ""pseudo-modules"" are provided as arguments to the factory function. var dep1 = require('app/foo'); exports.foo2 = function () { return foo() + 2; }; curl.js also supports unwrapped CommonJS modules (and node.js modules) via the cjsm11 module loader. To use this module loader for a package, say Backbone, you would provide it to a package config, like this: curl.config({     packages: [         {             name: 'backbone',             location: 'bower_components/backbone',             main: 'backbone.min.js',             config: { moduleLoader: 'curl/loader/cjsm11' } /* <-- hey! */         }     ] }); Read the notes in the src/curl/loader folder and the cjsm11.js file for more information about loading CommonJS and node.js modules. curl.js's global API is for bootstrapping an app. You would typically only use this API once in your application to load the main module of your application. For a complete description, check out the wiki. curl(['main', 'other', 'another' /* etc */], callback, errorback); Loads a module named ""main"" along with two other modules and then executes callback, handing it the exported values of the modules as parameters. ['main', 'other', 'another']: Module names or plugin-prefixed resource files. callback: Function to receive modules or resources. This is where you'd typically start up your app. Optional. errorback: Function to receive an exception parameter when loading fails. Optional. curl(['main', 'other', 'another' /* etc */])     .then(callback, errorback); Promises-based API for executing callbacks. ['main', 'other', 'another']: Module names or plugin-prefixed resource files. callback: Function to receive modules or resources. Optional. errorback: Function to call if an exception occurred while loading. Optional. Note: curl.js's Promises are not compliant with ES6 or Promises/A+ so they may not behave as you'd expect. For full compliance, use when.js or any another ES6 Promise shim. when(curl(['dep1'])).then(callback); or Promise.resolve(curl(['dep1'])).then(callback); curl(config, ['main' /* etc */], callback, errorback); Specify configuration options, load dependencies, and execute callback. config: Object containing curl configuration options (paths, etc.) ['main']: Module name(s). callback: Function to receive modules or resources. Optional. errorback: Function to call if an exception occurred while loading. Optional. curl(['main', 'domReady!' /* etc */]).then(     callback,     errorback ); curl(['main', 'domReady!' /* etc */], function (main) {     // do some bootstrapping here }); Executes the callback when the dom is ready for manipulation AND all dependencies have loaded. curl(['domReady!', 'js!nonAMD.js!order', 'js!another.js!order']), function () {     /* do something cool here */ }); Executes the function when the non-AMD javascript files are loaded and the dom is ready. The another.js file will wait for the nonAMD.js file before executing. Note: Please use curl.js's new legacy loader for much more flexible and sensible loading of non-AMD scripts. Please read the docs in the src/curl/loader folder for more information. Note: if a file supports AMD or CommonJS module formats, you can not use the js! plugin on that file. curl(['js!nonAMD.js'])     .next(['dep1', 'dep2', 'dep3'], function (dep1, dep2, dep3) {         // do something before the dom is ready     })     .next(['domReady!'])     .then(         function () {             // do something after the dom is ready         },         function (ex) {             // show an error to the user         }     ); Executes callbacks in stages using .next(deps, callback). Note: .next() does not load resources in parallel. Therefore, it is a last resort when other options do not satisfy your use case. You should use the preloads config option and/or the legacy loader whenever possible. curl = {     baseUrl: '/path/to/my/js',     pluginPath: 'for/some/reason/plugins/r/here',     paths: {         curl: 'curl/src/curl',         cssx: 'cssx/src/cssx',         my: '../../my-lib/'     },     apiName: 'someOtherName' }; If called before the <script> that loads curl.js, a global curl var will configure curl.js when it loads. All of the configuration parameters are optional. curl.js tries to do something sensible in their absence. :) Some common configuration options: baseUrl: the root folder to find all modules, default is the document's folder paths: a mapping of module paths to relative paths (from baseUrl) pluginPath: the place to find plugins when they are specified without a path (e.g. ""css!myCssFile"" vs. ""cssx/css!myCssFile"") and there is no paths mapping that applies. apiName: an alternate name to curl and require for curl.js's global variable apiContext: an object, rather than window, to place curl on when using apiName A more complete list can be found on the wiki. Very Simple Example <script>      // configure curl     curl = {         paths: {             cssx: 'cssx/src/cssx/',             stuff: 'my/stuff/'         }     };  </script> <script src=""../js/curl.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script> <script type=""text/javascript"">      curl(         // fetch all of these resources (""dependencies"")         [             'stuff/three', // an AMD module             'cssx/css!stuff/base', // a css file             'i18n!stuff/nls/strings', // a translation file             'text!stuff/template.html', // an html template             'domReady!'         ]     )     // when they are loaded     .then(         // execute this callback, passing all dependencies as params         function (three, link, strings, template) {             var body = document.body;             if (body) {                 body.appendChild(document.createTextNode('three == ' + three.toString() + ' '));                 body.appendChild(document.createElement('br'));                 body.appendChild(document.createTextNode(strings.hello));                 body.appendChild(document.createElement('div')).innerHTML = template;             }         },         // execute this callback if there was a problem         function (ex) {             var msg = 'OH SNAP: ' + ex.message;             alert(msg);         }     );  </script> The file structure for this example would look as follows: js/     curl/         plugin/             i18n.js             text.js         domReady.js     cssx/         src/             cssx/                 css.js     my/         stuff/             nls/                 strings.js             base.css             template.html             three.js     curl.js  What is an asynchronous loader? Web apps, especially large ones, require many modules and resources. Most of these modules and resources need to be loaded at page load, but some may be loaded later, either in the background or ""just in time"". They also need to be loaded as quickly as possible. The traditional way to load javascript modules is via a <SCRIPT> element in an HTML page. Similarly, CSS files are loaded via a <LINK> element, and text resources are either loaded in the page or via XHR calls. The problem with <SCRIPT> and <LINK> elements is that a browser must execute them sequentially since it has no idea if one may depend on another. It just assumes the developer has placed them in the correct order and that there are dependencies. (The term ""synchronous loading"" is used to describe this process since the elements are executed in a single timeline.) If there are no dependencies between two files, loading them sequentially is a waste of time. These files could be loaded and executed in parallel (i.e at the same time). An asynchronous loader does just that: it loads javascript files (and other types of files) in parallel whenever possible. curl.js has lots of company. Other async loaders include LABjs, Steal.js, yepnope.js, $script.js, the Backdraft loader (bdLoad), and RequireJS. (a more complete list) What is AMD? Asynchronous Module Definition is a de facto standard for javascript modules that can be loaded by asynchronous loaders. It defines a simple API that developers can use to write their javascript modules so that they may be loaded by any AMD-compliant loader. AMD Spec The AMD proposal follows some parts of the CommonJS Modules proposal. Because of the way browsers load and evaluate scripts, AMD can't follow it completely without causing significant processing overhead. Instead, AMD allows us to place a lightweight wrapper around javascript modules to help work around the shortcomings. Ultimately, both proposals (AMD and Modules 1.1) are in preparation for an official javascript modules specification and eventual implementation in browsers. If you don't want to wait for official javascript modules, then don't. The future is now. AMD works now -- and it's awesome. AMD's API focuses on one globally-available function: define() and some CommonJS-inspired variables, require(), exports, and module. require() specifies a list of dependent modules or resources that must be loaded before running a set of code. This code resides in a callback function that is executed asynchronously, i.e. it runs later, not in the current ""thread"". Specifically, it executes when all of the dependencies are loaded and ready. The proposal does not mandate that require() be specified globally. In fact, at a global level, the concerns of a loader are about application bootstrapping and not about finding dependencies. To keep the confusion about these two concepts to a minimum, curl.js uses curl() for the public API. You may rename this API back to require() by supplying the apiName config param (apiName: ""require""), but this is not recommended. It's more important that the define() method be consistent. This is the method that tells the loader what modules have been loaded by a script. define() also specifies a list of dependencies and a callback function that defines and/or creates the resource when the dependencies are ready. Optionally, define() also takes a name parameter, but this is mainly for build tools and optimizers. Inside the define(), the require() method acts like other AMD loaders. AMD's API also helps code reuse by providing compatibility with CommonJS (server) modules. AMD-compliant loaders support the same require() syntax and argument signatures as server-side javascript (ssjs) modules. The beauty of AMD loaders is their ability to remove the drudgery of manually managing dependencies. Since all dependencies are listed within the modules, the loader will ensure that everything is loaded into the browser -- and in the right order. Can curl.js work with non-AMD and non-CommonJS javascript files? Yes, but why would you? Once you start using AMD, you'll never go back! :) You may use non-AMD javascript files by using the legacy loader like this: curl.config({     paths: {         plainOldJsFile1: {             location: 'js/plainOldJsFile1.js',             config: { loader: 'curl/loader/legacy', exports: 'aGlobal' }         },         anotherPlainOldJsFile: {             location: 'js/anotherPlainOldJsFile.js',             config: {                 loader: 'curl/loader/legacy',                 exports: 'anotherGlobal',                 requires: [ 'plainOldJsFile1' ]             }         }     } }); curl(['anotherPlainOldJsFile']).then(     function (anotherGlobal) {         /* do something with your plain, boring javascript files */     },     function () {         /* do something if any fail to load */     } ); Please read the docs in the src/curl/loader folder for more information. Can curl.js load non-javascript files via plugins? Yes, curl.js follows the CommonJS Loader Plugin specification, so you can use any compatible plugin. The following plugins are included: js! -- loads non-AMD javascript files. more info on the wiki text! -- loads text files link! -- loads css files via a link element (simple, fast) css! -- loads css files (lots of options) domReady! -- resolves when the dom is ready for manipulation async! -- resolves when a module signals it's ready i18n! -- loads text strings and other locale-specific constants Some plugin docs are on the wiki. More documentation is available inside the source of these plugins! How are modules loaded? curl.js uses <script> element injection rather than XHR/eval for AMD modules. This allows curl.js to load cross-domain scripts as well as local scripts. CommonJS modules use XHR/eval so must be wrapped for ""transport"" if not on the same domain. Typically, you will bundle your modules before using them in production, anyways. Most bundlers will wrap CommonJS modules in AMD. To find scripts and other resources, curl.js uses module names. A module name looks just like a file path, but typically without the file extension. If a module requires a plugin in order to load correctly, it will have a prefix delimited by a ""!"" and will also often have a file extension when a plugin may load different types of files. Some examples of module names: dojo/store/JsonRest my/lib/string/format js!my/lib/js/plain-old-js.js css!my/styles/reset.css http://some-cdn/uber/module By default, curl.js will look in the same folder as the current document's location. For instance, if your web page is located at http://my-domain/apps/myApp.html, curl.js will look for the JsonRest module at http://my-domain/apps/dojo/store/JsonRest.js. You can tell curl.js to find modules in other locations by specifying a baseUrl or individual packages for each of your libraries. For example, if you specify a baseUrl of /resources/ and the following paths: packages: [     { name: ""dojo"", location: ""third-party/dojo"" },     { name: ""css"", location: ""third-party/cssmojo/css"" },     { name: ""my"", location: ""my-cool-app-v1.3"" },     { name: ""my/lib/js"", location: ""old-js-libs"" } ] Then the modules listed above will be sought in the following locations: /resources/third-party/dojo/store/JsonRest.js /resources/my-cool-app-v1.3/lib/string/format.js /resources/old-js-libs/plain-old-js.js /resources/my-cool-app-v1.3/styles/reset.css http://some-cdn/uber/module.js Note: you will need to create a path to curl.js's plugins and other modules if the curl folder isn't directly under the same folder as your web page. curl.js uses the same mechanism to find its own modules. What are AMD plugins? AMD supports the notion of plugins. Plugins are AMD modules that can be used to load javascript modules -- or other types of resources. curl comes with several plugins already, including a text plugin (for templates or other text resources), two different css plugins, a dom-ready plugin, and several others. Plugins are designated by a prefix on the name of the module or resource to be loaded. They are delineated by a ! symbol. The following example shows the use of some plugins: define(     [         'text!myTemplate.html',         'css!myCssFile'     ],     function (templateString, cssLinkNode) {         // do something with the template and css here     } ); Since plugins are just AMD modules, they would typically be referenced using their fully-pathed names. curl provides a pluginPath configuration option that allows you to specify the folder where [most of] your plugins reside so you don't have to specify their full paths. This also helps with compatibility with other AMD loaders. If one or more of your plugins does not reside in the folder specified by the pluginPath config option, you can use its full path or you can specify a path for it in curl's paths config object. // example of a fully-pathed plugin under the lib/cssx folder define(['lib/cssx!myCssFile'], function (cssxDef) {     // do some awesome css stuff here }); Plugins can also have configuration options. Global options can be specified on curl's configuration object. Options can also be supplied to plugins via suffixes. Suffixes are also delineated by the ! symbol. Here's an example of a plugin using options: // don't try to repair IE6-8 opacity issues in my css file define(['css!myCssFile!ignore:opacity'], function (cssxDef) {     // do some awesome css stuff here }); How do I use curl.js? Learn about AMD-formatted javascript modules if you don't already know how. Clone or download curl to your local machine or server. Figure out the baseUrl and paths configuration that makes sense for your project. Check out the ""API at a glance"" section above to figure out which loading methodology you want to use. Study the ""Very Simple Example"" and some of the test files. Try it on your own files. Too Many Modules! I have dozens (or hundreds) of modules. Even with parallel loading, the performance sucks! What can I do about that? True! No parallel loader can lessen the latency required to create an HTTP connection. If you have dozens or hundreds of files to download, it's going to take time to initiate each of the connections. However, there are tools to that are designed to fix this problem! There are builders and compilers. dojo users are probably already familiar with dojo's build tool and optimizer. RequireJS comes with a build tool and Google's Closure compiler. The build tool is used to concatenate several modules (and/or resources) into just a few files. It does this by following the dependency chain specified in the define() and require() calls. You can specify which top-level modules or resources are in each file and the build tool finds the rest. After the build tool creates the concatenated files, the files can be passed into a compiler (also called a shrinker or compressor). curl.js is compatible with RequireJS's build tool, r.js, but there's also cram. Cram is the cujoJS resource assembler. Package Support cujoJS supports packages. Packages are defined by the packages configuration parameter: curl = {     baseUrl: 'path/to/js',     packages: {         'my-package': {             location: 'path/to/my-package',             main: 'main/main-module-file',             config: { /* package-specific configuration options */ }         }     } }; curl = {     baseUrl: 'path/to/js',     packages: [         {             name: 'my-package',             location: 'path/to/my-package',             main: 'main/main-module-file',             config: { /* package-specific configuration options */ }         }     ] }; The path property describes where to find the package in relation to the baseUrl parameter. The main and lib properties describe where to find modules inside the package. The main property gives the relative path to the package's main module. In the example above, the main module of the package can be obtained as follows: curl(['my-package'], callback); and will be fetched from the following path: path/to/js/path/to/my-package/main/main-module-file.js  Some other file in the package would be obtained as follows: curl(['my-package/other-module'], callback); and will be fetched from the following path: path/to/js/path/to/my-package/other-module.js  Note that a package may also contain it's own embedded set of config options. Most, but not all, config options may be specified here. Specifically, you cannot specify any options that change the path or id of modules, such as paths, packages, plugins, or 'pluginPrefix.

I'm not responding to issues or pull requests, since I don't use this project anymore and don't have time to work on it. Please feel free to fork it if you want to continue development on it. LazyLoad is a tiny (only 966 bytes minified and gzipped), dependency-free JavaScript utility that makes it super easy to load external JavaScript and CSS files on demand. Whenever possible, LazyLoad will automatically load resources in parallel while ensuring execution order when you specify an array of URLs to load. In browsers that don't preserve the execution order of asynchronously-loaded scripts, LazyLoad will safely load the scripts sequentially. Use LazyLoad when you need a small, fast, safe dynamic JS or CSS loader, but don't need the overhead of dependency management or other extra functionality that larger script loaders provide. Downloads lazyload.js (full source) Usage Using LazyLoad is simple. Just call the appropriate method -- css() to load CSS, js() to load JavaScript -- and pass in a URL or array of URLs to load. You can also provide a callback function if you'd like to be notified when the resources have finished loading, as well as an argument to pass to the callback and a context in which to execute the callback. // Load a single JavaScript file and execute a callback when it finishes. LazyLoad.js('http://example.com/foo.js', function () {   alert('foo.js has been loaded'); });  // Load multiple JS files and execute a callback when they've all finished. LazyLoad.js(['foo.js', 'bar.js', 'baz.js'], function () {   alert('all files have been loaded'); });  // Load a CSS file and pass an argument to the callback function. LazyLoad.css('foo.css', function (arg) {   alert(arg); }, 'foo.css has been loaded');  // Load a CSS file and execute the callback in a different scope. LazyLoad.css('foo.css', function () {   alert(this.foo); // displays 'bar' }, null, {foo: 'bar'}); Supported Browsers Firefox 2+ Google Chrome Internet Explorer 6+ Opera 9+ Safari 3+ Mobile Safari Android Other browsers may work, but haven't been tested. It's a safe bet that anything based on a recent version of Gecko or WebKit will probably work. Caveats All browsers support parallel loading of CSS. However, only Firefox and Opera currently support parallel script loading while preserving execution order. To ensure that scripts are always executed in the correct order, LazyLoad will load all scripts sequentially in browsers other than Firefox and Opera. Hopefully other browsers will improve their parallel script loading behavior soon. License Copyright (c) 2011 Ryan Grove (ryan@wonko.com). All rights reserved.

Browser Support IE 6+ Opera 10+ Safari 3+ Chrome 1+ Firefox 2+ Examples old school - blocks CSS, Images, AND JS! <script src=""jquery.js""></script> <script src=""my-jquery-plugin.js""></script> <script src=""my-app-that-uses-plugin.js""></script> middle school - loads as non-blocking, but has multiple dependents $script('jquery.js', function () {   $script('my-jquery-plugin.js', function () {     $script('my-app-that-uses-plugin.js')   }) }) new school - loads as non-blocking, and ALL js files load asynchronously // load jquery and plugin at the same time. name it 'bundle' $script(['jquery.js', 'my-jquery-plugin.js'], 'bundle')  // load your usage $script('my-app-that-uses-plugin.js')   /*--- in my-jquery-plugin.js ---*/ $script.ready('bundle', function() {   // jquery & plugin (this file) are both ready   // plugin code... })   /*--- in my-app-that-uses-plugin.js ---*/ $script.ready('bundle', function() {   // use your plugin :) }) Exhaustive list of ways to use $script.js $script('foo.js', function() {   // foo.js is ready })   $script(['foo.js', 'bar.js'], function() {   // foo.js & bar.js is ready })   $script(['foo.js', 'bar.js'], 'bundle') $script.ready('bundle', function() {   // foo.js & bar.js is ready })  // create an id and callback inline $script(['foo.js', 'bar.js'], 'bundle', function () {   // foo.js & bar.js is ready })   $script('foo.js', 'foo') $script('bar.js', 'bar') $script   .ready('foo', function() {     // foo.js is ready   })   .ready('bar', function() {     // bar.js is ready   })   var dependencyList = {     foo: 'foo.js'   , bar: 'bar.js'   , thunk: ['thunkor.js', 'thunky.js'] }  $script('foo.js', 'foo') $script('bar.js', 'bar')  // wait for multiple depdendencies! $script.ready(['foo', 'bar', 'thunk'], function () {   // foo.js & bar.js & thunkor.js & thunky.js is ready }, function(depsNotFound) {     // foo.js & bar.js may have downloaded     // but ['thunk'] dependency was never found     // so lazy load it now     depsNotFound.forEach(function(dep) {       $script(dependencyList[dep], dep)     })   })   // in my-awesome-plugin.js $script.ready('jquery', function() {   //define awesome jquery plugin here   $script.done('my-awesome-plugin') })  // in index.html $script('jquery.js', 'jquery') $script('my-awesome-plugin.js') $script.ready('my-awesome-plugin', function() {   //run code here when jquery and my awesome plugin are both ready }) $script.path() Optionally to make working with large projects easier, there is a path variable you can set to set as a base. $script.path('/js/modules/') $script(['dom', 'event'], function () {   // use dom & event }); Note that this will include all scripts from here on out with the base path. If you wish to circumvent this for any single script, you can simply call $script.get() $script.path('/js/modules/') $script(['dom', 'event'], function () {   // use dom & event })  $script.get('http://example.com/base.js', function () {  }) $script.urlArgs() As of 2.5.5 it's possible to concat URL arguments (i.e. a query string) to the script path. This is especially useful when you're in need of a cachebuster and works as follows: $script.urlArgs('key=value&foo=bar'); Please note that Squid, a popular proxy, doesn’t cache resources with a querystring. This hurts performance when multiple users behind a proxy cache request the same file – rather than using the cached version everybody would have to send a request to the origin server. So ideally, as Steve Souders points out, you should rev the filename itself. Developers Building a $script environment works like this: npm install -dev make Ender support You can add $script to your existing ender build by adding it as such: ender add scriptjs Get access to it as such: $.require(...) You can also require it as such: var $S = require('scriptjs')  $S('/foo.js', function () {   // foo is ready }) Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Loads any module format with exact circular reference and binding support. Loads ES6 modules compiled into the System.register bundle format for production, maintaining circular references support. Supports RequireJS-style map, paths, bundles and global shims. Loader plugins allow custom transpilation or asset loading. Built to the format ES6-specified loader API from ES6 Specification Draft Rev 27, Section 15, and will be updated to the WhatWG loader API as soon as it can be considered stable for implementation. ~19KB minified and gzipped, runs in IE8+ and NodeJS. For discussion, join the Gitter Room. Documentation ES6 Modules Overview SystemJS Overview Config API Module Formats Production Workflows System API Creating Plugins Basic Use Browser <script src=""system.js""></script> <script>   // set our baseURL reference path   SystemJS.config({     baseURL: '/js'   });    // loads /js/main.js   SystemJS.import('main.js'); </script> The above will support loading all module formats, including ES Modules transpiled into the System.register format. To load ES6 code with in-browser transpilation, configure one of the following transpiler plugins: Babel TypeScript Traceur Promise Polyfill SystemJS relies on Promise being present in the environment. For the best performance in IE and older browsers, it is advisable to load a polyfill like Bluebird or es6-promise before SystemJS. Otherwise, when Promise is not available, SystemJS will attempt to load the system-polyfills.js file located in the dist folder which contains the when.js Promise polyfill. NodeJS To load modules in NodeJS, install SystemJS with:   npm install systemjs  If transpiling ES6, also install the transpiler plugin, following the instructions from the transpiler project page. We can then load modules equivalently to in the browser: var SystemJS = require('systemjs');  // loads './app.js' from the current directory SystemJS.import('./app.js').then(function(m) {   console.log(m); }); If you are using jspm as a package manager you will also need to load the generated configuration. The best way to do this in node is to get your System instance through jspm, which will automatically load your config correctly for you: var Loader = require('jspm').Loader; var SystemJS = new Loader();  SystemJS.import('lodash').then(function (_) {  console.log(_); }); Plugins Supported loader plugins: CSS Image JSON Text Node Binary Additional Plugins: Audio CoffeeScript Ember Handlebars Handlebars HTML Image (lazy) Jade Jade VirtualDOM jst JSX Markdown raw SASS SCSS sofe SVG WebFont YAML Guides: Using plugins Creating plugins Running the tests To install the dependencies correctly, run bower install from the root of the repo, then open test/test.html in a browser with a local server or file access flags enabled.

The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. TL; DR Bundles both CommonJS and AMD modules (even combined). Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time). Dependencies are resolved during compilation reducing the runtime size. Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. coffeescript to JavaScript, handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc. Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires. Getting Started Check out webpack's documentation for quick Getting Started guide, in-depth usage, tutorials and resources. Installation project: npm install webpack --save-dev global: npm install webpack -g Usage: https://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/ Examples Take a look at the examples folder. Features Plugins webpack has a rich plugin interface. Most of the features within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very flexible. Performance webpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast and incredibly fast on incremental compilations. Loaders webpack enables use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle any static resource way beyond JavaScript. You can easily write your own loaders using node.js. Loaders are activated by using loadername! prefixes in require() statements, or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration. Please see Using Loaders for more information. basic json: Loads file as JSON raw: Loads raw content of a file (as utf-8) val: Executes code as module and consider exports as JavaScript code script: Executes a JavaScript file once in global context (like in script tag), requires are not parsed. packaging file: Emits the file into the output folder and returns the (relative) url. url: The url loader works like the file loader, but can return a Data Url if the file is smaller than a limit. image: Compresses your images. Ideal to use together with file or url. svgo-loader: Compresses SVG images using svgo library baggage: Automatically require any resources related to the required one polymer-loader: Process HTML & CSS with preprocessor of choice and require() Web Components like first-class modules. dialects coffee: Loads coffee-script like JavaScript babel: Turn ES6 code into vanilla ES5 using Babel. livescript: Loads LiveScript like JavaScript sweetjs: Use sweetjs macros. traceur: Use future JavaScript features with Traceur. typescript: Loads TypeScript like JavaScript. templating html: Exports HTML as string, require references to static resources. jade: Loads jade template and returns a function handlebars: Loads handlebars template and returns a function ractive: Pre-compiles Ractive templates for interactive DOM manipulation markdown: Compiles Markdown to HTML ng-cache: Puts HTML partials in the Angular's $templateCache styling style: Add exports of a module as style to DOM css: Loads css file with resolved imports and returns css code cssnext: Loads and compiles a css file using cssnext less: Loads and compiles a less file sass: Loads and compiles a scss file stylus: Loads and compiles a stylus file misc po: Loads a PO gettext file and returns JSON mocha: Do tests with mocha in browser or node.js eslint: PreLoader for linting code using ESLint. jshint: PreLoader for linting code. jscs: PreLoader for style checking. injectable: Allow to inject dependencies into modules transform: Use browserify transforms as loader. For the full list of loaders, see list of loaders. Module Format (AMD/CommonJS) webpack supports both AMD and CommonJS module styles. It performs clever static analysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate simple expressions. This allows you to support most existing libraries out of the box. Code Splitting webpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are loaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time. Code Splitting documentation Optimizations webpack can do many optimizations to reduce the output size of your JavaScript by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving you full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime through code splitting. It can also can make your code chunks cache friendly by using hashes. Optimization documentation A small example of what's possible // webpack is a module bundler. // This means webpack takes modules with dependencies // and emits static assets representing those modules.  // Dependencies can be written in CommonJS var commonjs = require(""./commonjs""); // or in AMD define([""amd-module"", ""../file""], function (amdModule, file) {     // while previous constructs are sync,     // this is async     require([""big-module/big/file""], function (big) {          // For async dependencies, webpack splits          // your application into multiple ""chunks"".          // This part of your application is          // loaded on demand (code-splitting).         var stuff = require(""../my/stuff"");         // ""../my/stuff"" is also loaded on-demand         //  because it's in the callback function         //  of the AMD require.     }); });   require(""coffee!./cup.coffee""); // ""Loaders"" are used to preprocess files. // They can be prefixed in the require call // or configured in the configuration. require(""./cup""); // This does the same when you add "".coffee"" to the extensions // and configure the ""coffee"" loader for /\.coffee$/  function loadTemplate (name) {     return require(""./templates/"" + name + "".jade"");     // Many expressions are supported in require calls.     // A clever parser extracts information and concludes     // that everything in ""./templates"" that matches     // /\.jade$/ should be included in the bundle, as it     // can be required. }   // ...and you can combine everything. function loadTemplateAsync (name, callback) {     require([""bundle?lazy!./templates/"" + name + "".jade""],       function (templateBundle) {               templateBundle(callback);     }); } Documentation documentation Changelog changelog Tests You can run the Node tests with npm test. You can run the browser tests: cd test/browsertests node build  and open tests.html in the browser. Contribution Most of the time, if webpack is not working correctly for you it is a simple configuration issue. If you are still having difficulty after looking over your configuration carefully, please post a question to StackOverflow with the webpack tag. Questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files are more likely to receive responses. If you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github. If you create a loader or plugin, please consider open sourcing it, putting it on NPM and following the x-loader, x-plugin convention. You are also welcome to correct any spelling mistakes or any language issues. If you want to discuss something or just need help, here is our gitter.im room.

Install with npm install -g rollup and run rollup --help to get started. Dive into the wiki when you're ready to learn more about Rollup and ES6 modules. A next-generation ES6 module bundler When you're developing software, it's much easier to break your library or application apart into separate pieces that you can work on separately. It's also very likely that you'll have dependencies on third party libraries. The result is lots of small files – but that's bad news for browsers, which get slowed down by having to make many requests. (It's also bad news for Node!) The solution is to write your code as modules, and use a module bundler to concatenate everything into a single file. Browserify and Webpack are examples of module bundlers. So far, so good, but there's a problem. When you include a library in your bundle... var utils = require( 'utils' );  var query = 'Rollup'; utils.ajax( 'https://api.example.com?search=' + query ).then( handleResponse ); ...you include the whole library, including lots of code you're not actually using. ES6 modules solve this problem. Instead of importing the whole of utils, we can just import the ajax function we need: import { ajax } from 'utils';  var query = 'Rollup'; ajax( 'https://api.example.com?search=' + query ).then( handleResponse ); Rollup statically analyses your code, and your dependencies, and includes the bare minimum in your bundle. Shouldn't we be writing those utilities as small modules anyway? Not always, no. Don't minifiers already do this? If you minify code with something like UglifyJS (and you should!) then some unused code will be removed: (function () {   function foo () {     console.log( 'this function was included!' );   }    function bar () {     console.log( 'this function was not' );     baz();   }    function baz () {     console.log( 'neither was this' );   }    foo(); })(); A minifier can detect that foo gets called, but that bar doesn't. When we remove bar, it turns out that we can also remove baz. But because of the limitations of static analysis, and the dynamic nature of JavaScript, it can't do the same thing with code like this: (function () {   var obj = {     foo: function () {       console.log( 'this method was included!' );     },      bar: function () {       console.log( 'so was this :-(' );       this.baz();     },      baz: function () {       console.log( 'and this :-(' );     }   };    obj.foo(); })(); Unfortunately, traditional modules – CommonJS and AMD – result in code more like the second example than the first, making them next-to-impossible to optimise. Rather than excluding dead code, we should be including live code (aka 'tree-shaking'). That's only possible with ES6 modules. Can I use it with my non-ES6 dependencies? Yes! Rollup can't work its tree-shaking magic on CommonJS modules, but it can convert them to ES6 via plugins. Can I distribute my package as an ES6 module? If your package.json has a jsnext:main field, ES6-aware tools like Rollup can import the ES6 version of the package instead of the legacy CommonJS or UMD version. You'll be writing your code in a more future-proof way, and helping to bring an end to the dark days of JavaScript package management. Learn more here. See rollup-starter-project for inspiration on how to get started. How does this compare to JSPM/SystemJS? JSPM is awesome, and it uses Rollup in its builder! In addition to bundling modules, it also combines a repository with a package manager and a client-side module loader. JSPM allows you to use any module format and even develop without a build step, so it's a great choice for creating applications. Stand-alone Rollup doesn't use the complex SystemJS format, making it a better choice for creating libraries. License Released under the MIT license.

Jun 16, 2016 README.md QUnit - A JavaScript Unit Testing Framework. QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use, JavaScript unit testing framework. It's used by the jQuery project to test its code and plugins but is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code (and even capable of testing JavaScript code on the server-side). QUnit is especially useful for regression testing: Whenever a bug is reported, write a test that asserts the existence of that particular bug. Then fix it and commit both. Every time you work on the code again, run the tests. If the bug comes up again - a regression - you'll spot it immediately and know how to fix it, because you know what code you just changed. Having good unit test coverage makes safe refactoring easy and cheap. You can run the tests after each small refactoring step and always know what change broke something. QUnit is similar to other unit testing frameworks like JUnit, but makes use of the features JavaScript provides and helps with testing code in the browser, e.g. with its stop/start facilities for testing asynchronous code. If you are interested in helping developing QUnit, you are in the right place. For related discussions, visit the QUnit and Testing forum. Development To submit patches, fork the repository, create a branch for the change. Then implement the change, run npm test to lint and test it, then commit, push and create a pull request. Include some background for the change in the commit message and Fixes #nnn, referring to the issue number you're addressing. To run npm test, you need Node.js, which includes npm. Releases Use jquery-release. The following aren't handled there, do that first: Install git-extras and run git changelog to update History.md. Clean up the changelog, removing merge commits, whitespace cleanups or other irrelevant commits. Run grunt authors and add any new authors to AUTHORS.txt Update the version property in package.json to have the right -pre version. Not necessary for patch releases. Commit these: Build: Prepare @VERSION release, including authors and history update  Then run the script: node release.js --remote=jquery/qunit  Update jquery/qunitjs.com, replacing previous versions with new ones: pages/index.html resources/*.html Update GitHub releases, use the changelog from History.md. Finally announce on Twitter @qunitjs (add highlights if possible, otherwise a 2nd tweet might do): Released @VERSION: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/releases/tag/1.17.0  Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Sandboxed and Fast: Jest virtualizes JavaScript environments, provides browser mocks and runs tests in parallel across workers. Mock by Default: Jest automatically mocks JavaScript modules, making most existing code testable. Getting Started First install Jest with npm by running: npm install --save-dev jest-cli  Great! Now let's get started by writing a test for a hypothetical sum.js file: function sum(a, b) {   return a + b; } module.exports = sum; Create a directory __tests__/ with a file sum-test.js: jest.unmock('../sum'); // unmock to use the actual implementation of sum  describe('sum', () => {   it('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {     const sum = require('../sum');     expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);   }); }); Add the following to your package.json: ""scripts"": {   ""test"": ""jest"" } Run npm test: [PASS] __tests__/sum-test.js (0.010s)  The code for this example is available at examples/getting_started. And you are ready to enjoy working with Jest! Babel Integration If you'd like to use Babel, it can easily be enabled: npm install --save-dev babel-jest babel-polyfill  Don't forget to add a .babelrc file in your project's root folder. For example, if you are using ES2015 and React.js with the babel-preset-es2015 and babel-preset-react presets: {   ""presets"": [""es2015"", ""react""] } You are now set up to use all ES2015 features and React specific syntax, for example: jest.unmock('../CheckboxWithLabel');  import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import TestUtils from 'react-addons-test-utils'; import CheckboxWithLabel from '../CheckboxWithLabel';  describe('CheckboxWithLabel', () => {   it('changes the text after click', () => {     // Render a checkbox with label in the document     const checkbox = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(       <CheckboxWithLabel labelOn=""On"" labelOff=""Off"" />     );      const checkboxNode = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(checkbox);      // Verify that it's Off by default     expect(checkboxNode.textContent).toEqual('Off');      // ...   }); }); Check out the React tutorial for more. And you are good to go! The next time you run Jest it will print something like  Using Jest CLI v<version>, jasmine2, babel-jest  The React, Relay and react-native repositories have excellent examples of tests written by Facebook engineers. Advanced Features Only run test files related to changes with jest -o On large projects and applications it is often not feasible to run thousands of tests when a single file changes. Jest uses static analysis to look up dependency trees in reverse starting from changed JavaScript files only. During development, it is recommended to use jest -o or jest --onlyChanged which will find tests related to changed JavaScript files and only run relevant tests. Install Jest globally Jest can be installed globally: npm install -g jest-cli which will make a global jest command available that can be invoked from anywhere within your project. Async testing Promises and even async/await can be tested easily. Assume a user.getUserName function that returns a promise, now consider this async test with Babel and babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator or babel-preset-stage-3: jest.unmock('../user');  import * as user from '../user';  describe('async tests', () => {   // The promise that is being tested should be returned.   it('works with promises', () => {     return user.getUserName(5)       .then(name => expect(name).toEqual('Paul'));   });    it('works with async/await', async () => {     const userName = await user.getUserName(4);     expect(userName).toEqual('Mark');   }); }); Check out the Async tutorial for more. Automated Mocking and Sandboxing Jest isolates test files into their own environment and isolates module execution between test runs. Jest swaps out require() to inject mocks that were either created manually by the user or automatic mocks through the automocking feature. Use the --watch option to automatically re-run tests Jest can automatically re-run tests when files change: jest --watch  Use --bail to abort after the first failed test. If you don't want to wait until a full test run completes --bail can be used to abort the test run after the first error. Use --coverage to generate a code coverage report Code coverage can be generated easily with --coverage. -----------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------| File                   |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines | -----------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|  react/                |     91.3 |    60.61 |      100 |      100 |   CheckboxWithLabel.js |     91.3 |    60.61 |      100 |      100 | -----------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|  Use --json for CI integrations Jest can be integrated into Continuous Integration test runs and wrapped with other scripts to further analyze test results. Example Output: {   ""success"": true,   ""startTime"": 1456983486661,   ""numTotalTests"": 1,   ""numTotalTestSuites"": 1,   ""numRuntimeErrorTestSuites"": 0,   ""numPassedTests"": 1,   ""numFailedTests"": 0,   ""numPendingTests"": 0,   ""testResults"":[     {       ""name"": ""react/__tests__/CheckboxWithLabel-test.js"",       ""status"": ""passed"",       ""startTime"": 1456983488908,       ""endTime"": 1456983493037     }   ] } Remote debugging with Web Inspector Web Inspector can be used to debug both the application code and the testing code. To set this up, first verify that you have both node-inspector and node-debug installed. which node-inspector which node-debug  Install packages that you are missing. npm install -g node-inspector node-debug  Run node-debug with the Jest binary as the target. node-debug node_modules/jest-cli/bin/jest.js -i  You should see that Node Inspector has been started in the prompt. Node Inspector Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/?port=5858 to start debugging. Debugging `node_modules/jest-cli/bin/jest.js`  Debugger listening on port 5858  A new Chrome window should open and subsequently open a page to localhost on port 5858. If this does not happen, you can go to the debugging URL directly in a Chrome browser tab. The program should stop in the jest.js file in the first line of code. Press the play button in the inspector window to continue execution. To stop the code at an arbitrary point, set a debugger expression in the code where you would like the program to stop. Stop (ctrl-c) and restart node-debug in the command line to catch at the debugger expression you just added.

Jest API jest.clearAllTimers() Removes any pending timers from the timer system. This means, if any timers have been scheduled (but have not yet executed), they will be cleared and will never have the opportunity to execute in the future. jest.disableAutomock() Disables automatic mocking in the module loader. After this method is called, all require()s will return the real versions of each module (rather than a mocked version). This is usually useful when you have a scenario where the number of dependencies you want to mock is far less than the number of dependencies that you don't. For example, if you're writing a test for a module that uses a large number of dependencies that can be reasonably classified as ""implementation details"" of the module, then you likely do not want to mock them. Examples of dependencies that might be considered ""implementation details"" are things ranging from language built-ins (e.g. Array.prototype methods) to highly common utility methods (e.g. underscore/lo-dash, array utilities etc) and entire libraries like React.js. Note: this method was previously called autoMockOff. When using babel-jest, calls to disableAutomock will automatically be hoisted to the top of the code block. Use autoMockOff if you want to explicitly avoid this behavior. jest.enableAutomock() Re-enables automatic mocking in the module loader. Note: this method was previously called autoMockOn. When using babel-jest, calls to enableAutomock will automatically be hoisted to the top of the code block. Use autoMockOn if you want to explicitly avoid this behavior. jest.fn(?implementation) Returns a new, unused mock function. Optionally takes a mock implementation.   const mockFn = jest.fn();   mockFn();   expect(mockFn).toBeCalled();    // With a mock implementation:   const returnsTrue = jest.fn(() => true);   console.log(returnsTrue()) // true; jest.isMockFunction(fn) Determines if the given function is a mocked function. jest.genMockFromModule(moduleName) Given the name of a module, use the automatic mocking system to generate a mocked version of the module for you. This is useful when you want to create a manual mock that extends the automatic mock's behavior. jest.mock(moduleName, ?factory) Indicates that the module system should always return a mocked version of the specified module from require() (e.g. that it should never return the real module).   jest.mock('moduleName');    const moduleName = require('moduleName'); // moduleName will be explicitly mocked The second argument can be used to specify an explicit module factory that is being run instead of using Jest's automocking feature:   jest.mock('moduleName', () => {     return jest.fn(() => 42);   });    const moduleName = require('moduleName'); // This runs the function specified as second argument to `jest.mock`.   moduleName(); // Will return '42'; Note: When using babel-jest, calls to mock will automatically be hoisted to the top of the code block. Use doMock if you want to explicitly avoid this behavior. jest.runAllTicks() Exhausts the micro-task queue (usually interfaced in node via process.nextTick). When this API is called, all pending micro-tasks that have been queued via process.nextTick will be executed. Additionally, if those micro-tasks themselves schedule new micro-tasks, those will be continually exhausted until there are no more micro-tasks remaining in the queue. jest.runAllTimers() Exhausts the macro-task queue (i.e., all tasks queued by setTimeout() and setInterval()). When this API is called, all pending ""macro-tasks"" that have been queued via setTimeout() or setInterval() will be executed. Additionally if those macro-tasks themselves schedule new macro-tasks, those will be continually exhausted until there are no more macro-tasks remaining in the queue. This is often useful for synchronously executing setTimeouts during a test in order to synchronously assert about some behavior that would only happen after the setTimeout() or setInterval() callbacks executed. See the Timer mocks doc for more information. jest.runOnlyPendingTimers() Executes only the macro-tasks that are currently pending (i.e., only the tasks that have been queued by setTimeout() or setInterval() up to this point). If any of the currently pending macro-tasks schedule new macro-tasks, those new tasks will not be executed by this call. This is useful for scenarios such as one where the module being tested schedules a setTimeout() whose callback schedules another setTimeout() recursively (meaning the scheduling never stops). In these scenarios, it's useful to be able to run forward in time by a single step at a time. jest.setMock(moduleName, moduleExports) Explicitly supplies the mock object that the module system should return for the specified module. On occasion there are times where the automatically generated mock the module system would normally provide you isn't adequate enough for your testing needs. Normally under those circumstances you should write a manual mock that is more adequate for the module in question. However, on extremely rare occasions, even a manual mock isn't suitable for your purposes and you need to build the mock yourself inside your test. In these rare scenarios you can use this API to manually fill the slot in the module system's mock-module registry. Note It is recommended to use jest.mock() instead. The jest.mock API's second argument is a module factory instead of the expected exported module object. jest.unmock(moduleName) Indicates that the module system should never return a mocked version of the specified module from require() (e.g. that it should always return the real module). The most common use of this API is for specifying the module a given test intends to be testing (and thus doesn't want automatically mocked). Note: this method was previously called dontMock. When using babel-jest, calls to unmock will automatically be hoisted to the top of the code block. Use dontMock if you want to explicitly avoid this behavior. jest.useFakeTimers() Instructs Jest to use fake versions of the standard timer functions (setTimeout, setInterval, clearTimeout, clearInterval, nextTick, setImmediate and clearImmediate). Fake timers are used by default. jest.useRealTimers() Instructs Jest to use the real versions of the standard timer functions. Mock API mockFn.mock.calls An array that represents all calls that have been made into this mock function. Each call is represented by an array of arguments that were passed during the call. For example: A mock function f that has been called twice, with the arguments f('arg1', 'arg2'), and then with the arguments f('arg3', 'arg4') would have a mock.calls array that looks like this: [   ['arg1', 'arg2'],   ['arg3', 'arg4'] ] mockFn.mock.instances An array that contains all the object instances that have been instantiated from this mock function. For example: A mock function that has been instantiated twice would have the following mock.instances array: var mockFn = jest.fn();  var a = new mockFn(); var b = new mockFn();  mockFn.mock.instances[0] === a; // true mockFn.mock.instances[1] === b; // true mockFn.mockClear() Resets all information stored in the mockFn.mock.calls and mockFn.mock.instances arrays. Often this is useful when you want to clean up a mock's usage data between two assertions. mockFn.mockImplementation(fn) Accepts a function that should be used as the implementation of the mock. The mock itself will still record all calls that go into and instances that come from itself – the only difference is that the implementation will also be executed when the mock is called. Note: jest.fn(implementation) is a shorthand for mockImplementation. For example: const mockFn = jest.fn().mockImplementation(scalar => 42 + scalar); // or: jest.fn(scalar => 42 + scalar);  const a = mockFn(0); const b = mockFn(1);  a === 42; // true b === 43; // true  mockFn.mock.calls[0][0] === 0; // true mockFn.mock.calls[1][0] === 1; // true mockImplementation can also be used to mock class constructors: // SomeClass.js module.exports = class SomeClass {   m(a, b) {} }  // OtherModule.test.js const SomeClass = require('SomeClass') const mMock = jest.fn() SomeClass.mockImplementation(() => {   return {     m: mMock   } })  const some = new SomeClass() some.m('a', 'b') console.log('Calls to m: ', mMock.mock.calls)  mockFn.mockReturnThis() Just a simple sugar function for: jest.fn(function() {   return this; }); mockFn.mockReturnValue(value) Deprecated: Use jest.fn(() => value) instead. const mockNumberFn = jest.fn(() => 42); mockNumberFn(); // 42  // Deprecated behavior: jest.genMockFunction().mockImplementation(() => value); mockFn.mockReturnValueOnce(value) Just a simple sugar function for: const valueReturned = false; jest.fn(() => {   if (!valueReturned) {     valueReturned = true;     return value;   } }); require Extensions require.requireActual(moduleName) Returns the actual module instead of a mock, bypassing all checks on whether the module should receive a mock implementation or not. require.requireMock(moduleName) Returns a mock module instead of the actual module, bypassing all checks on whether the module should be required normally or not. Property testing Jest supports property testing with the testcheck-js library. The API is the same as that of jasmine-check: check.it(name, [options], generators, fn) Creates a property test. Test cases will be created by the given generators and passed as arguments to fn. If any test case fails, a shrunken failing value will be given in the test output. For example: check.it('can recover encoded URIs',   [gen.string],   s => expect(s).toBe(decodeURI(encodeURI(s)))); If options are provided, they override the corresponding command-line options. The possible options are: {   times: number;   // The number of test cases to run. Default: 100.   maxSize: number; // The maximum size of sized data such as numbers                    // (their magnitude) or arrays (their length). This can be                    // overridden with `gen.resize`. Default: 200.   seed: number;    // The random number seed. Defaults to a random value. }  check.fit(name, [options], generators, fn) Executes this test and skips all others. Like fit, but for property tests. check.xit(name, [options], generators, fn) Skips this test. Like xit, but for property tests. gen A library of generators for property tests. See the testcheck documentation. Configuration Jest's configuration can be defined in the package.json file of your project or through the --config <path/to/json> option. If you'd like to use your package.json to store Jest's config, the ""jest"" key should be used on the top level so Jest will know how to find your settings: {   ""name"": ""my-project"",   ""jest"": {     ""verbose"": true   } } When using the --config option, the JSON file must not contain a ""jest"" key: {   ""bail"": true,   ""verbose"": true } automock [boolean] (default: true) By default, Jest mocks every module automatically. If you are building a small JavaScript library and would like to use Jest, you may not want to use automocking. You can disable this option and create manual mocks or explicitly mock modules using jest.mock(moduleName). browser [boolean] (default: false) Respect the Browserify's ""browser"" field in package.json when resolving modules. Some modules export different versions based on whether they are operating in Node or a browser. bail [boolean] (default: false) By default, Jest runs all tests and produces all errors into the console upon completion. The bail config option can be used here to have Jest stop running tests after the first failure. cacheDirectory [string] (default: '/tmp/') The directory where Jest should store its cached dependency information. Jest attempts to scan your dependency tree once (up-front) and cache it in order to ease some of the filesystem raking that needs to happen while running tests. This config option lets you customize where Jest stores that cache data on disk. coverageDirectory [string] (default: undefined) The directory where Jest should output its coverage files. collectCoverage [boolean] (default: false) Indicates whether the coverage information should be collected while executing the test. Because this retrofits all executed files with coverage collection statements, it may significantly slow down your tests. collectCoverageOnlyFrom [object] (default: undefined) An object that, when present, indicates a set of files for which coverage information should be collected. Any files not present in this set will not have coverage collected for them. Since there is a performance cost for each file that we collect coverage information from, this can help prune this cost down to only the files in which you care about coverage (such as the specific modules that you are testing). coveragePathIgnorePattern [array] (default: ['/node_modules/']) An array of regexp pattern strings that are matched against all file paths before executing the test. If the file path matches any of the patterns, coverage information will be skipped. These pattern strings match against the full path. Use the <rootDir> string token to include the path to your project's root directory to prevent it from accidentally ignoring all of your files in different environments that may have different root directories. Example: ['<rootDir>/build/', '<rootDir>/node_modules/']. coverageThreshold [object] (default: undefined) This will be used to configure minimum threshold enforcement for coverage results. If the thresholds are not met, jest will return failure. Thresholds, when specified as a positive number are taken to be the minimum percentage required. When a threshold is specified as a negative number it represents the maximum number of uncovered entities allowed. For example, statements: 90 implies minimum statement coverage is 90%. statements: -10 implies that no more than 10 uncovered statements are allowed. {   ...   ""jest"": {     ""coverageThreshold"": {       ""global"": {         ""branches"": 50,         ""functions"": 50,         ""lines"": 50,         ""statements"": 50       }     }   } } globals [object] (default: {}) A set of global variables that need to be available in all test environments. For example, the following would create a global __DEV__ variable set to true in all test environments: {   ...   ""jest"": {     ""globals"": {       ""__DEV__"": true     }   } } Note that, if you specify a global reference value (like an object or array) here, and some code mutates that value in the midst of running a test, that mutation will not be persisted across test runs for other test files. mocksPattern [string] (default: (?:[\\/]|^)__mocks__[\\/]) A pattern that is matched against file paths to determine which folder contains manual mocks. moduleFileExtensions [array] (default: ['js', 'json', 'node']) An array of file extensions your modules use. If you require modules without specifying a file extension, these are the extensions Jest will look for. If you are using TypeScript this should be ['js', 'json', 'ts'] modulePathIgnorePatterns [array] (default: []) An array of regexp pattern strings that are matched against all module paths before those paths are to be considered 'visible' to the module loader. If a given module's path matches any of the patterns, it will not be require()-able in the test environment. These pattern strings match against the full path. Use the <rootDir> string token to include the path to your project's root directory to prevent it from accidentally ignoring all of your files in different environments that may have different root directories. Example: ['<rootDir>/build/']. modulePaths [array] (default: []) An alternative API to setting the NODE_PATH env variable, modulePaths is an array of absolute paths to additional locations to search when resolving modules. moduleDirectories [array] (default: ['node_modules']) An array of directory names to be searched recursively up from the requiring module's location. Setting this option will override the default, if you wish to still search node_modules for packages include it along with any other options: ['node_modules', 'bower_components'] moduleNameMapper [object] (default: null) A map from regular expressions to module names that allow to stub out resources, like images or styles with a single module. Use <rootDir> string token to refer to rootDir value if you want to use file paths. Additionally, you can substitute captured regex groups using numbered backreferences. Example:   ""moduleNameMapper"": {     ""^image![a-zA-Z0-9$_-]+$"": ""GlobalImageStub"",     ""^[./a-zA-Z0-9$_-]+\.png$"": ""<rootDir>/RelativeImageStub.js"",     ""module_name_(.*)"": ""<rootDir>/substituted_module_$1.js""   } notify [boolean] (default: false) Activates notifications for test results. rootDir [string] (default: The root of the directory containing the package.json or the pwd if no package.json is found) The root directory that Jest should scan for tests and modules within. If you put your Jest config inside your package.json and want the root directory to be the root of your repo, the value for this config param will default to the directory of the package.json. Oftentimes, you'll want to set this to 'src' or 'lib', corresponding to where in your repository the code is stored. Note that using '<rootDir>' as a string token in any other path-based config settings to refer back to this value. So, for example, if you want your setupFiles config entry to point at the env-setup.js file at the root of your project, you could set its value to ['<rootDir>/env-setup.js']. scriptPreprocessor [string] (default: undefined) The path to a module that provides a synchronous function from pre-processing source files. For example, if you wanted to be able to use a new language feature in your modules or tests that isn't yet supported by node (like, for example, ES6 classes), you might plug in one of many transpilers that compile ES6 to ES5 here. Examples of such compilers include jstransform, recast, regenerator, and traceur. Note: Jest's preprocessor is only ran once per file unless the file has changed. During development of a scriptPreprocessor it can be useful to run Jest with --no-cache or to frequently delete Jest's cache. preprocessorIgnorePatterns [array] (default: ['/node_modules/']) An array of regexp pattern strings that are matched against all source file paths before preprocessing. If the test path matches any of the patterns, it will not be preprocessed. These pattern strings match against the full path. Use the <rootDir> string token to include the path to your project's root directory to prevent it from accidentally ignoring all of your files in different environments that may have different root directories. Example: ['<rootDir>/bower_components/', '<rootDir>/node_modules/']. Note: if this option is not specified by the user and Jest detects the project as a react-native project, it will ignore the default and process every file. It is common on react-native projects to ship npm modules without pre-compiling JavaScript. setupFiles [array] (default: []) The paths to modules that run some code to configure or set up the testing environment before each test. Since every test runs in its own environment, these scripts will be executed in the testing environment immediately before executing the test code itself. It's worth noting that this code will execute before setupTestFrameworkScriptFile. setupTestFrameworkScriptFile [string] (default: undefined) The path to a module that runs some code to configure or set up the testing framework before each test. Since setupFiles executes before the test framework is installed in the environment, this script file presents you the opportunity of running some code immediately after the test framework has been installed in the environment. For example, Jest ships with several plug-ins to jasmine that work by monkey-patching the jasmine API. If you wanted to add even more jasmine plugins to the mix (or if you wanted some custom, project-wide matchers for example), you could do so in this module. testEnvironment [string] (default: 'jsdom') The test environment that will be used for testing. The default environment in Jest is a browser-like environment through jsdom. If you are building a node service, you can use the node option to use a node-like environment instead. testPathDirs [array] (default: ['<rootDir>']) A list of paths to directories that Jest should use to search for tests in. There are times where you only want Jest to search in a single sub-directory (such as cases where you have a src/ directory in your repo), but not the rest of the repo. testPathIgnorePatterns [array] (default: ['/node_modules/']) An array of regexp pattern strings that are matched against all test paths before executing the test. If the test path matches any of the patterns, it will be skipped. These pattern strings match against the full path. Use the <rootDir> string token to include the path to your project's root directory to prevent it from accidentally ignoring all of your files in different environments that may have different root directories. Example: ['<rootDir>/build/', '<rootDir>/node_modules/']. testPathPattern [string] (default: /.*/) - See notes below for more details on the default setting. A regexp pattern string that is matched against all test paths before executing the test. If the test path does not match the pattern, it will be skipped. This is useful if you need to override the default. If you are testing one file at a time the default will be set to /.*/, however if you pass a blob rather than a single file the default will then be the absolute path of each test file. The override may be needed on windows machines where, for example, the test full path would be C:/myproject/__tests__/mystest.jsx.jest and the default pattern would be set as /C:\myproject\__tests__\mystest.jsx.jest/. testRegex [string] (default: '__tests__/.*\.js$') The pattern Jest uses to detect test files. By default it looks for .js files inside of __tests__ folders. testResultsProcessor [string] (default: undefined) This option allows the use of a custom results processor. This processor must be a node module that exports a function expecting an object with the following structure as the first argument: {   ""success"": bool,   ""startTime"": epoch,   ""numTotalTestSuites"": number,   ""numPassedTestSuites"": number,   ""numFailedTestSuites"": number,   ""numRuntimeErrorTestSuites"": number,   ""numTotalTests"": number,   ""numPassedTests"": number,   ""numFailedTests"": number,   ""numPendingTests"": number,   ""testResults"": [{     ""numFailingTests"": number,     ""numPassingTests"": number,     ""numPendingTests"": number,     ""testResults"": [{       ""title"": string (message in it block),       ""status"": ""failed"" | ""pending"" | ""passed"",       ""ancestorTitles"": [string (message in describe blocks)],       ""failureMessages"": [string],       ""numPassingAsserts"": number     },     ...     ],     ""perfStats"": {       ""start"": epoch,       ""end"": epoch     },     ""testFilePath"": absolute path to test file,     ""coverage"": {}   },   ...   ] }  testRunner [string] (default: jasmine2) This option allows use of a custom test runner. The default is jasmine2. Jest also ships with jasmine1 which can enabled by setting this option to jasmine1. A custom test runner can be provided by specifying a path to a test runner implementation. unmockedModulePathPatterns [array] (default: []) An array of regexp pattern strings that are matched against all modules before the module loader will automatically return a mock for them. If a module's path matches any of the patterns in this list, it will not be automatically mocked by the module loader. This is useful for some commonly used 'utility' modules that are almost always used as implementation details almost all the time (like underscore/lo-dash, etc). It's generally a best practice to keep this list as small as possible and always use explicit jest.mock()/jest.unmock() calls in individual tests. Explicit per-test setup is far easier for other readers of the test to reason about the environment the test will run in. It is possible to override this setting in individual tests by explicitly calling jest.mock() at the top of the test file. verbose [boolean] (default: false) Indicates whether each individual test should be reported during the run. All errors will also still be shown on the bottom after execution. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Screencasts: node.gif, browser.gif, both.gif, headless browser Slides: slides.com/azer/prova Features and screenshots: Embeds Tape Comes with a builtin web app to run tests on browser, sourcemaps are enabled. Outputs less when tests pass (Node, Browser) Outputs more when tests fail (Node, Browser) Browser app runs tests inside of an iframe Screenshot Uses watchify to observe file changes and restart browser tests. GIF Screenshot Lets filtering test cases (e.g node test.js -g foobar) Comes with browser-launcher for launching browsers automatically and headless testing. (Screenshot) Clickable error stacks on the browser: Screenshot Optional progress bar for slow tests. GIFs: Node / Browser Install $ npm install -g azer/prova Usage Example test: var test = require('prova')  test('timing test', function (t) {   t.plan(2)    t.equal(typeof Date.now, 'function')   var start = Date.now()    setTimeout(function () {     t.equal(Date.now() - start, 100)   }, 100) }) In Node, it will output: $ node test.js Passed 1 test.  Or, in case it fails: In Browser To run the tests in a web browser, just pass -b parameter: $ node test.js -b Visit localhost:7559 with a browser to start running the tests. Then visit localhost:7559 in your web browser: In case it fails, it'll show: The web app uses watchify to monitor file changes. So, you won't have to reload the page when you modify a source code. Prova runs the tests inside of an iframe. In case you test some UI stuff, you can open the iframe by clicking the < button on the right: Multiple Tests Prova comes with a command-line script when you install it globally; $ npm install -g prova And it allows you running multiple tests on both Node and browser; $ prova test/foo.js test/bar.js $ prova test/**/*.js -b Launching Browsers and Headless Testing List the detected browsers; $ prova -l Available Browsers: safari v7.0.2, chrome v34.0.1847.116, phantom v1.9.7 And launch after publishing the tests: $ prova -b -l safari If your system has Xvfb, you can pass -e parameter to open the browser headlessly: $ prova -b -l chrome -e Or you can just run the tests on PhantomJS: $ prova -b -l phantom If you get no matches for errors and you think that your system has that browser, try removing browser-launcher's config: $ rm /Users/azer/.config/browser-launcher/config.json Browserify Transforms Prova automatically applies bunch of transforms by looking at the file extension. If you'd like to use a transform that doesn't exist in Prova by default, you can choose it with a parameter; $ node test -b -t coffeeify Multiple transforms can be specified using comma; $ node test -b -t coffeeify,brfs,foo,bar Browserify Plugins Pass Browserify plugins passing -u or --plugin parameter; $ node test -b --plugin foo Use comma to separate multiple plugins; $ node test -b --plugin foo,bar Custom Frame Documents When you're running the tests on the browser, Prova has an empty HTML template that loads and runs the JavaScript tests. You can customize this HTML file with -f or --frame parameter: $ node test -b -f test.html Click the arrow button on right middle to keep the frame open. You'll be seeing the HTML document and test results in the same screen. Manually Restarting Browser Tests Prova watches for changes and automatically restarts the browser tests (inside in an iframe) but in case you need, there is an endpoint for restarting all the tests by hitting an endpoint; $ curl localhost:7559/restart  Loading Assets You may need to load your images, web workers etc. for testing. Prova allows you to load assets from your current directory via the /assets/in endpoint. Let's say you'd like to load a file called ""foobar.png"": $ curl http://localhost:7559/assets/in/foobar.png  Should work for you. HTTP Proxy HTTP proxying is pretty useful to by-pass cross-domain issues (CORS) on the browser. You can easily point a URL to another host using -y / --http-proxy parameters: $ node test -b -y ""/my-api=http://localhost:8080""  Assuming that you'll be running your tests on :7559, any requests to /my-api will be streamed through localhost:8080 in the above example. Command-line       USAGE            prova [filenames] [options]        OPTIONS            -g     --grep         Run tests matching with given pattern            -b     --browser       Publishes the tests on 0.0.0.0:7559           -o     --port          Publish the tests on given port number.           -d     --hostname      Publish the tests on given hostname.           -l     --launch        List available browsers to launch or launch specified browser.           -e     --headless      Launch the browser headlessly. (Requires xvfb)           -r     --proxy         Launch the browser with specified proxy configuration.           -q     --quit          Shut down the browser server once all the tests are done.           -f     --frame         Specify a custom document to run tests on browser. e.g node test -b -f custom.html           -x     --exec          Execute given commmand before running the tests.           -y     --http-proxy    Proxy requests matching with given pattern to a target. e.g -y ""/images=localhost:8080""            -t     --transform     Use given Browserify transforms. e.g node test -b -t coffeeify,brfs           -u     --plugin        Use given Browserify plugins. e.g node test -b -u foo,bar            -s     --progress      Show a progress bar. Useful when tests are running slow.            -p     --tap           Output original Tap output without modifying anything.            -C     --no-console    Disable showing browser console messages on command-line.            -v     --version       Show version and exit           -h     --help          Show help and exit                  --examples      Show example commands  Example Commands     EXAMPLES          1. Run the tests on NodeJS.             $ node test.js            $ node test            $ prova test/index.js            $ prova             All the above example commands will work same way. Prova assumes the filename of your test is either `test.js` or `test/index.js`         2. Publish the tests on localhost:7559, so you can run the tests on a web browser.            $ node test.js -b           $ prova test -b           $ prova -b         3. Publish the tests on given host and port.            $ node test.js -o 8080 -d foobar.net           $ prova test.js -o 8080 -d foobar.net         4. Publish the tests and launch a browser to automatically run the tests.            $ node test.js -b -l chrome           $ prova test.js -b -l chrome         5. List the browsers that can be launched automatically.            $ prova -l           $ node test.js -l         6. Run the tests with PhantomJS.            $ node test.js -b -l phantom           $ prova test.js -b -l phantom         7. Run only specified tests with PhantomJS.            $ node test.js -b -l phantom -g pattern           $ prova test.js -b -l phantom -g pattern         8. Launch Chrome headlessly using xvfb:            $ node test -b -l chrome -e           $ prova test -b -l chrome -e  Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Protractor is a Node.js program built on top of WebDriverJS. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would. Compatibility Protractor 4 is compatible with nodejs v4 and newer. When using nodejs v0.12, use protractor 2 (npm install -g protractor@2). Getting Started The Protractor documentation for users is located in the protractor/docs folder. To get set up and running quickly: The Protractor Website Work through the Tutorial Take a look at the Table of Contents Once you are familiar with the tutorial, you’re ready to move on. To modify your environment, see the Protractor Setup docs. To start writing tests, see the Protractor Tests docs. To better understand how Protractor works with the Selenium WebDriver and Selenium Server see the reference materials. Getting Help Check the Protractor FAQ and read through the Top 20 questions on StackOverflow. Please ask usage and debugging questions on StackOverflow (use the ""protractor"" tag), the Gitter chat room, or in the Angular discussion group. (Please do not ask support questions here on Github.) For Contributors Clone the github repository: git clone https://github.com/angular/protractor.git cd protractor npm install ./bin/webdriver-manager update cd website npm install cd ..  Start up a selenium server. By default, the tests expect the selenium server to be running at http://localhost:4444/wd/hub. A selenium server can be started with webdriver-manager which is included in bin/webdriver-manager. webdriver-manager update webdriver-manager start  Protractor's test suite runs against the included test application. Install the test application dependencies with: npm run install_testapp  Start that up with npm start  Then run the tests with npm test  Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Installation via npm (node package manager) $ npm install sinon  or via sinon's browser builds available for download on the homepage. Usage See the sinon project homepage for documentation on usage. If you have questions that are not covered by the documentation, please post them to the Sinon.JS mailing list or drop by #sinon.js on irc.freenode.net:6667 or the Gitter channel. Important: AMD needs pre-built version Sinon.JS as source doesn't work with AMD loaders (when they're asynchronous, like loading via script tags in the browser). For that you will have to use a pre-built version. You can either build it yourself or get a numbered version from http://sinonjs.org. This might or might not change in future versions, depending of outcome of investigations. Please don't report this as a bug, just use pre-built versions. Goals No global pollution Easy to use Require minimal “integration” Easy to embed seamlessly with any testing framework Easily fake any interface Ship with ready-to-use fakes for XMLHttpRequest, timers and more Contribute?

Let's say we wanted to test the following program: math.js function add (a, b) { return a + b; }; Our test file would look like this: describe('test suite', function () {   it('should expose a function', function () {     expect(add).to.be.a('function');   });    it('should do math', function () {     expect(add(1, 3)).to.equal(4);   }); }); If a certain expectation fails, an exception will be raised which gets captured and shown/processed by the test runner. Differences with should.js No need for static should methods like should.strictEqual. For example, expect(obj).to.be(undefined) works well. Some API simplifications / changes. API changes related to browser compatibility.

Props to Tom MacWright @tmcw for a fantastic job! Features and use cases Getting started and configuration Usage on Windows The command line Ignoring code for coverage API Changelog License and credits Features All-javascript instrumentation library that tracks statement, branch, and function coverage. Module loader hooks to instrument code on the fly Command line tools to run node unit tests ""with coverage turned on"" and no cooperation whatsoever from the test runner Multiple report formats: HTML, LCOV, Cobertura and more. Ability to use as middleware when serving JS files that need to be tested on the browser. Can be used on the command line as well as a library Based on the awesome esprima parser and the equally awesome escodegen code generator Well-tested on node (prev, current and next versions) and the browser (instrumentation library only) Use cases Supports the following use cases and more transparent coverage of nodejs unit tests instrumentation/ reporting of files in batch mode for browser tests Server side code coverage for nodejs by embedding it as custom middleware Getting started $ npm install -g istanbul  The best way to see it in action is to run node unit tests. Say you have a test script test.js that runs all tests for your node project without coverage. Simply: $ cd /path/to/your/source/root $ istanbul cover test.js  and this should produce a coverage.json, lcov.info and lcov-report/*html under ./coverage Sample of code coverage reports produced by this tool (for this tool!): HTML reports Usage on Windows Istanbul assumes that the command passed to it is a JS file (e.g. Jasmine, vows etc.), this is however not true on Windows where npm wrap bin files in a .cmd file. Since Istanbul can not parse .cmd files you need to reference the bin file manually. Here is an example using Jasmine 2: istanbul cover node_modules\jasmine\bin\jasmine.js  In order to use this cross platform (e.i. Linux, Mac and Windows), you can insert the above line into the script object in your package.json file but with normal slash. ""scripts"": {     ""test"": ""istanbul cover node_modules/jasmine/bin/jasmine.js"" }  Configuring Drop a .istanbul.yml file at the top of the source tree to configure istanbul. istanbul help config tells you more about the config file format. The command line $ istanbul help  gives you detailed help on all commands. Usage: istanbul help config | <command>  `config` provides help with istanbul configuration  Available commands are:        check-coverage               checks overall/per-file coverage against thresholds from coverage               JSON files. Exits 1 if thresholds are not met, 0 otherwise         cover   transparently adds coverage information to a node command. Saves               coverage.json and reports at the end of execution         help    shows help         instrument               instruments a file or a directory tree and writes the               instrumented code to the desired output location         report  writes reports for coverage JSON objects produced in a previous               run         test    cover a node command only when npm_config_coverage is set. Use in               an `npm test` script for conditional coverage   Command names can be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous  To get detailed help for a command and what command-line options it supports, run: istanbul help <command>  (Most of the command line options are not covered in this document.) The cover command $ istanbul cover my-test-script.js -- my test args # note the -- between the command name and the arguments to be passed  The cover command can be used to get a coverage object and reports for any arbitrary node script. By default, coverage information is written under ./coverage - this can be changed using command-line options. The cover command can also be passed an optional --handle-sigint flag to enable writing reports when a user triggers a manual SIGINT of the process that is being covered. This can be useful when you are generating coverage for a long lived process. The test command The test command has almost the same behavior as the cover command, except that it skips coverage unless the npm_config_coverage environment variable is set. This command is deprecated since the latest versions of npm do not seem to set the npm_config_coverage variable. The instrument command Instruments a single JS file or an entire directory tree and produces an output directory tree with instrumented code. This should not be required for running node unit tests but is useful for tests to be run on the browser. The report command Writes reports using coverage*.json files as the source of coverage information. Reports are available in multiple formats and can be individually configured using the istanbul config file. See istanbul help report for more details. The check-coverage command Checks the coverage of statements, functions, branches, and lines against the provided thresholds. Positive thresholds are taken to be the minimum percentage required and negative numbers are taken to be the number of uncovered entities allowed. Ignoring code for coverage Skip an if or else path with /* istanbul ignore if */ or /* istanbul ignore else */ respectively. For all other cases, skip the next 'thing' in the source with: /* istanbul ignore next */ See ignoring-code-for-coverage.md for the spec. API All the features of istanbul can be accessed as a library. Instrument code     var istanbul = require('istanbul');     var instrumenter = new istanbul.Instrumenter();      var generatedCode = instrumenter.instrumentSync('function meaningOfLife() { return 42; }',         'filename.js'); Generate reports given a bunch of coverage JSON objects     var istanbul = require('istanbul'),         collector = new istanbul.Collector(),         reporter = new istanbul.Reporter(),         sync = false;      collector.add(obj1);     collector.add(obj2); //etc.      reporter.add('text');     reporter.addAll([ 'lcov', 'clover' ]);     reporter.write(collector, sync, function () {         console.log('All reports generated');     }); For the gory details consult the public API Multiple Process Usage Istanbul can be used in a multiple process environment by running each process with Istanbul, writing a unique coverage file for each process, and combining the results when generating reports. The method used to perform this will depend on the process forking API used. For example when using the cluster module you must setup the master to start child processes with Istanbul coverage, disable reporting, and output coverage files that include the PID in the filename. Before each run you may need to clear out the coverage data directory.     if(cluster.isMaster) {         // setup cluster if running with istanbul coverage         if(process.env.running_under_istanbul) {             // use coverage for forked process             // disabled reporting and output for child process             // enable pid in child process coverage filename             cluster.setupMaster({                 exec: './node_modules/.bin/istanbul',                 args: [                     'cover', '--report', 'none', '--print', 'none', '--include-pid',                     process.argv[1], '--'].concat(process.argv.slice(2))             });         }         // ...         // ... cluster.fork();         // ...     } else {         // ... worker code     } Coverage.json For details on the format of the coverage.json object, see here.

FYI: Please note that this repo is not actively maintained If you're looking for a more active project for JavaScript code coverage, I recommend Istanbul. Project home page Blanket_js on Twitter for updates and news. NOTE: All Pull-Requests must be made into the master branch. Getting Started Philosophy Mechanism Grunt Integration Compatibility & Features List Roll Your Own Development Contact Contributors Revision History NOTE: Blanket.js will throw XHR cross domain errors if run with the file:// protocol. See Special Features Guide for more details and workarounds. Getting Started Please see the following guides for using Blanket.js: Browser Getting Started (Basic QUnit usage) Intermediate (Other test runners, global options) Advanced (writing your own reporters/adapters) Special Features Guide Node Getting Started (basic mocha setup) Intermediate (mocha testrunner, travis-ci reporter) Intermediate 2 (mocha, htmlcov, package.json setup) Configuration Options (Browser and Node) Philosophy Blanket.js is a code coverage tool for javascript that aims to be: Easy to install Easy to use Easy to understand Blanket.js can be run seamlessly or can be customized for your needs. Mechanism JavaScript code coverage compliments your existing JavaScript tests by adding code coverage statistics (which lines of your source code are covered by your tests). Blanket works in a 3 step process: Loading your source files Parsing the code using Esprima and node-falafel, and instrumenting the file by adding code tracking lines. Connecting to hooks in the test runner to output the coverage details after the tests have completed. Grunt Integration You've got a few options for using Grunt with Blanket: grunt-blanket A Grunt plugin has been created to allow you to use Blanket like a ""traditional"" code coverage tool (creating instrumented copies of physical files, as opposed to live-instrumenting). The plugin runs as a standlone project and can be found here. grunt-blanket-qunit Runs the QUnit-based Blanket report headlessly using PhantomJS. Results are displayed on the console, and the task will cause Grunt to fail if any of your configured coverage thresholds are not met. Minimum code coverage thresholds can be configured per-file, per-module, and globally. See: Plugin Repo Blog Walkthrough Compatibility and Features List See the Compatiblity and Feature List including links to working examples. Roll your own git clone git@github.com:alex-seville/blanket.git npm install Add your custom build details to the grunt.js file under concat npm run build A minified and unminfied copy of the source can be created (see the min task). Development All development takes place on the master branch Your pull request must pass all tests (run npm test to be sure) and respect all existing coverage thresholds Contact Feel free to add questions to the Issue tracker, or send them to @blanket_js. Contributors Thanks to the many people who have contributed to the project. And thanks also to: RequireJS, Esprima, node-falafel, Mocha, Qunit.

JSCover is an easy-to-use JavaScript code coverage measuring tool. It is an enhanced version of the popular JSCoverage tool, having added several features including branch coverage, LCOV and Cobertura XML reports for CI integration, hooks for automated tests and HTML Local Storage to maintain coverage data without the use of iFrames or JavaScript opened windows. It's distinguishing factor from other JavaScript coverage tools is that it easily runs in any browser (supporting JavaScript) allowing coverage measurement of tests that include DOM interaction. It can be run with most tools (e.g. Jasmine, QUnit, Mocha, etc...). Development Development with JSCover is simple (clean check-out and build should just work). It is an Ant build using Maven's dependency management. What you need: Java (minimum 1.6) Ant (developed with version 1.9.2 to 1.9.6) Most development has been done with IntelliJ ultimate edition, and some with Eclipse and IntelliJ community edition. Project files for IDEs are checked in, but any editor can be used. Before checking in any changes, be sure to run ant pre-commit which runs the full build and test suite, and enforces coverage limits on the combined unit and integration tests as well as on the combined unit, integration and acceptance tests.

It allows you to manipulate a web page with an external Javascript script: opening a webpage, clicking on links, modifying the content... It is useful to do functional tests, page automation, network monitoring, screen capture etc. It is a tool like PhantomJs, except that it runs Gecko instead of Webkit, and it is not (yet) natively headless. However, it can be headless with the use of xvfb under Linux or MacOS. SlimerJS provides the same API of PhantomJS. The current version of SlimerJS is highly compatible with PhantomJS 1.9. See current release notes in docs/release-notes-*.rst, and read the compatibility table to know the implementation level. The main goal of SlimerJS is to allow to execute all scripts developed for PhantomJS. So you could use tools like CasperJS. In fact, CasperJs 1.1 and higher can be executed with SlimerJS! SlimerJS is not only a PhantomJS clone, it contains also additional features. Technically, SlimerJS is a XUL/JS application that is launched with Firefox. Community Follow us on twitter: @slimerjs Ask your questions on the dedicated mailing list. Or discuss with us on IRC: channel #slimerjs on irc.mozilla.org. Install SlimerJS, executing a script... See documentation into the docs/ directory into the source code, or read it on the web site Roadmap The goal for a first major stable release 1.0 is to have a full implementation of the API of PhantomJS 1.9.x and 2.1, with the support of Coffee scripts and Ghost Driver.

Users interested in a pretty stable, recent version working with PhantomJS 2.0 and newer should choose the packaged 1.1.0 and following releases. The 1.0 branch is now obsolete. Please note that it is only recommended if you need to keep old production tests running that could do with the now unmaintained PhantomJS 1.9 1.0 tests unfortunately have to be run manually using the casperjs selftest command Note that all versions up to and including 1.1-beta3 do not support PhantomJS 2.0 and newer. The complete documentation for the current releases is hosted on docs.casperjs.org. CasperJS is a navigation scripting & testing utility for PhantomJS and SlimerJS (still experimental). It eases the process of defining a full navigation scenario and provides useful high-level functions, methods & syntactic sugar for doing common tasks such as: defining & ordering navigation steps filling forms clicking links capturing screenshots of a page (or an area) making assertions on remote DOM logging & events downloading resources, even binary ones catching errors and react accordingly writing functional test suites, exporting results as JUnit XML (xUnit) Browse the sample examples repository. Don't hesitate to pull request for any cool example of yours as well! Read the full documentation on casperjs documentation website. Subscribe to the project mailing-list Follow the CasperJS project on twitter and Google+. Show me some code! First install CasperJS, we'll use 1.1 beta here. Sample test to see if some dropdown can be opened: casper.test.begin('a twitter bootstrap dropdown can be opened', 2, function(test) {     casper.start('http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#dropdowns', function() {         test.assertExists('#navbar-example');         this.click('#dropdowns .nav-pills .dropdown:last-of-type a.dropdown-toggle');         this.waitUntilVisible('#dropdowns .nav-pills .open', function() {             test.pass('Dropdown is open');         });     }).run(function() {         test.done();     }); }); Run the script: Support Help request. If you're stuck using CasperJS and don't understand how to achieve something, please ask on the mailing-list first. If the discussion reveals that you have found a real issue that might need a change within CasperJS, file an issue. Filing issues. It takes a lot of time to review, validate, and de-duplicate filed issues. This time could be spent better on actually improving on CasperJS. Filing an issue might be a helpful contribution, but we expect you to read our CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines first. Professional Support. Need help with getting CasperJS up and running? Got a time-consuming problem you want to get solved quickly? Try to find someone to address your specific problem and post a reward at bountysource. If you need to have a known issue resolved and don't have the time or skills to do it on your own, you could post a reward for any open issue directly.

Jan 4, 2016 README.md Zombie.js Insanely fast, headless full-stack testing using Node.js Zombie 4.x is tested to work with io.js 1.6 or later. If you need to use Node 0.12 or earlier, consider using Zombie 2.x. The Bite If you're going to write an insanely fast, headless browser, how can you not call it Zombie? Zombie it is. Zombie.js is a lightweight framework for testing client-side JavaScript code in a simulated environment. No browser required. Let's try to sign up to a page and see what happens: const Browser = require('zombie');  // We're going to make requests to http://example.com/signup // Which will be routed to our test server localhost:3000 Browser.localhost('example.com', 3000);  describe('User visits signup page', function() {    const browser = new Browser();    before(function(done) {     browser.visit('/signup', done);   });    describe('submits form', function() {      before(function(done) {       browser         .fill('email',    'zombie@underworld.dead')         .fill('password', 'eat-the-living')         .pressButton('Sign Me Up!', done);     });      it('should be successful', function() {       browser.assert.success();     });      it('should see welcome page', function() {       browser.assert.text('title', 'Welcome To Brains Depot');     });   }); }); This example uses the Mocha testing framework, but Zombie will work with other testing frameworks. Since Mocha supports promises, we can also write the test like this: const Browser = require('zombie');  // We're going to make requests to http://example.com/signup // Which will be routed to our test server localhost:3000 Browser.localhost('example.com', 3000);  describe('User visits signup page', function() {    const browser = new Browser();    before(function() {     return browser.visit('/signup');   });    describe('submits form', function() {      before(function() {       browser         .fill('email',    'zombie@underworld.dead')         .fill('password', 'eat-the-living');       return browser.pressButton('Sign Me Up!');     });      it('should be successful', function() {       browser.assert.success();     });      it('should see welcome page', function() {       browser.assert.text('title', 'Welcome To Brains Depot');     });   });  }); Well, that was easy. Table of Contents Installing Browser Assertions Cookies Tabs Debugging Events Resources Pipeline Installing To install Zombie.js you will need io.js: $ npm install zombie --save-dev Browser browser.assert Methods for making assertions against the browser, such as browser.assert.element('.foo'). See Assertions for detailed discussion. browser.referer You can use this to set the HTTP Referer header. browser.resources Access to history of retrieved resources. See Resources for detailed discussion. browser.pipeline Access to the pipeline for making requests and processing responses. Use this to add new request/response handlers the pipeline for a single browser instance, or use Pipeline.addHandler to modify all instances. See Pipeline. browser.tabs Array of all open tabs (windows). Allows you to operate on more than one open window at a time. See Tabs for detailed discussion. browser.proxy The proxy option takes a URL so you can tell Zombie what protocol, host and port to use. Also supports Basic authentication, e.g.: browser.proxy = 'http://me:secret@myproxy:8080' browser.errors Collection of errors accumulated by the browser while loading page and executing scripts. Browser.localhost(host, port) Allows you to make requests against a named domain and HTTP/S port, and will route it to the test server running on localhost and unprivileged port. For example, if you want to call your application ""example.com"", and redirect traffic from port 80 to the test server that's listening on port 3000, you can do this: Browser.localhost('example.com', 3000) browser.visit('/path', function() {   console.log(browser.location.href); }); => 'http://example.com/path' The first time you call Browser.localhost, if you didn't specify Browser.site, it will set it to the hostname (in the above example, ""example.com""). Whenever you call browser.visit with a relative URL, it appends it to Browser.site, so you don't need to repeat the full URL in every test case. You can use wildcards to map domains and all hosts within these domains, and you can specify the source port to map protocols other than HTTP. For example: // HTTP requests for example.test www.example.test will be answered by localhost // server running on port 3000 Browser.localhost('*.example.test', 3000); // HTTPS requests will be answered by localhost server running on port 3001 Browser.localhost('*.example.test:443', 3001); The underlying implementation hacks net.Socket.connect, so it will route any TCP connection made by the Node application, whether Zombie or any other library. It does not affect other processes running on your machine. Browser.extend You can use this to customize new browser instances for your specific needs. The extension function is called for every new browser instance, and can change properties, bind methods, register event listeners, etc. Browser.extend(function(browser) {   browser.on('console', function(level, message) {     logger.log(message);   });   browser.on('log', function(level, message) {     logger.log(message);   }); }); Assertions To make life easier, Zombie introduces a set of convenience assertions that you can access directly from the browser object. For example, to check that a page loaded successfully: browser.assert.success(); browser.assert.text('title', 'My Awesome Site'); browser.assert.element('#main'); These assertions are available from the browser object since they operate on a particular browser instance -- generally dependent on the currently open window, or document loaded in that window. Many assertions require an element/elements as the first argument, for example, to compare the text content (assert.text), or attribute value (assert.attribute). You can pass one of the following values: An HTML element or an array of HTML elements A CSS selector string (e.g. ""h2"", "".book"", ""#first-name"") Many assertions take an expected value and compare it against the actual value. For example, assert.text compares the expected value against the text contents of one or more strings. The expected value can be one of: A JavaScript primitive value (string, number) undefined or null are used to assert the lack of value A regular expression A function that is called with the actual value and returns true if the assertion is true Any other object will be matched using assert.deepEqual Note that in some cases the DOM specification indicates that lack of value is an empty string, not null/undefined. All assertions take an optional last argument that is the message to show if the assertion fails. Better yet, use a testing framework like Mocha that has good diff support and don't worry about these messages. Available Assertions The following assertions are available: assert.attribute(selection, name, expected, message) Asserts the named attribute of the selected element(s) has the expected value. Fails if no element found. browser.assert.attribute('form', 'method', 'post'); browser.assert.attribute('form', 'action', '/customer/new'); // Disabled with no attribute value, i.e. <button disabled> browser.assert.attribute('button', 'disabled', ''); // No disabled attribute i.e. <button> browser.assert.attribute('button', 'disabled', null); assert.className(selection, className, message) Asserts that selected element(s) has that and only that class name. May also be space-separated list of class names. Fails if no element found. browser.assert.className('form input[name=email]', 'has-error'); assert.cookie(identifier, expected, message) Asserts that a cookie exists and has the expected value, or if expected is null, that no such cookie exists. The identifier is either the name of a cookie, or an object with the property name and the optional properties domain and path. browser.assert.cookie('flash', 'Missing email address'); assert.element(selection, message) Asserts that one element matching selection exists. Fails if no element or more than one matching element are found. browser.assert.element('form'); browser.assert.element('form input[name=email]'); browser.assert.element('form input[name=email].has-error'); assert.elements(selection, count, message) Asserts how many elements exist in the selection. The argument count can be a number, or an object with the following properties: atLeast - Expecting to find at least that many elements atMost - Expecting to find at most that many elements exactly - Expecting to find exactly that many elements browser.assert.elements('form', 1); browser.assert.elements('form input', 3); browser.assert.elements('form input.has-error', { atLeast: 1 }); browser.assert.elements('form input:not(.has-error)', { atMost: 2 }); assert.evaluate(expression, expected, message) Evaluates the JavaScript expression in the context of the currently open window. With one argument, asserts that the value is equal to true. With two/three arguments, asserts that the returned value matches the expected value. browser.assert.evaluate('$(""form"").data(""valid"")'); browser.assert.evaluate('$(""form"").data(""errors"").length', 3); assert.global(name, expected, message) Asserts that the global (window) property has the expected value. assert.hasClass(selection, className, message) Asserts that selected element(s) have the expected class name. Elements may have other class names (unlike assert.className). Fails if no element found. browser.assert.hasClass('form input[name=email]', 'has-error'); assert.hasFocus(selection, message) Asserts that selected element has the focus. If the first argument is null, asserts that no element has the focus. Otherwise, fails if element not found, or if more than one element found. browser.assert.hasFocus('form input:nth-child(1)'); assert.hasNoClass(selection, className, message) Asserts that selected element(s) does not have the expected class name. Elements may have other class names (unlike assert.className). Fails if no element found. browser.assert.hasNoClass('form input', 'has-error'); assert.input(selection, expected, message) Asserts that selected input field(s) (input, textarea, select etc) have the expected value. Fails if no element found. browser.assert.input('form input[name=text]', 'Head Eater'); assert.link(selection, text, url, message) Asserts that at least one link exists with the given selector, text and URL. The selector can be a, but a more specific selector is recommended. URL can be relative to the current document, or a regular expression. Fails if no element is selected that also has the specified text content and URL. browser.assert.link('footer a', 'Privacy Policy', '/privacy'); assert.redirected(message) Asserts the browser was redirected when retrieving the current page. assert.success(message) Asserts the current page loaded successfully (status code 2xx or 3xx). assert.status(code, message) Asserts the current page loaded with the expected status code. browser.assert.status(404); assert.style(selection, style, expected, message) Asserts that selected element(s) have the expected value for the named style property. For example: Fails if no element found, or element style does not match expected value. browser.assert.style('#show-hide.hidden', 'display', 'none'); browser.assert.style('#show-hide:not(.hidden)', 'display', ''); assert.text(selection, expected, message) Asserts that selected element(s) have the expected text content. For example: Fails if no element found that has that text content. browser.assert.text('title', 'My Awesome Page'); assert.url(url, message) Asserts the current page has the expected URL. The expected URL can be one of: The full URL as a string A regular expression A function, called with the URL and returns true if the assertion is true An object, in which case individual properties are matched against the URL For example: browser.assert.url('http://localhost/foo/bar'); browser.assert.url(new RegExp('^http://localhost/foo/\\w+$')); browser.assert.url({ pathname: '/foo/bar' }); browser.assert.url({ query: { name: 'joedoe' } }); Roll Your Own Assertions Not seeing an assertion you want? You can add your own assertions to the prototype of Browser.Assert. For example: // Asserts the browser has the expected number of open tabs. Browser.Assert.prototype.openTabs = function(expected, message) {   assert.equal(this.browser.tabs.length, expected, message); }; Or application specific: // Asserts which links is highlighted in the navigation bar Browser.Assert.navigationOn = function(linkText) {   this.assert.element('.navigation-bar');   this.assert.text('.navigation-bar a.highlighted', linkText); }; Cookies Are delicious. Also, somewhat tricky to work with. A browser will only send a cookie to the server if it matches the request domain and path. Most modern Web applications don't care so much about the path and set all cookies to the root path of the application (/), but do pay attention to the domain. Consider this code: browser.setCookie(name: 'session', domain: 'example.com', value: 'delicious'); browser.visit('http://example.com', function() {   const value = browser.getCookie('session');   console.log('Cookie', value); }); In order for the cookie to be set in this example, we need to specify the cookie name, domain and path. In this example we omit the path and choose the default /. To get the cookie in this example, we only need the cookie name, because at that point the browser has an open document, and it can use the domain of that document to find the right cookie. We do need to specify a domain if we're interested in other cookies, e.g for a 3rd party widget. There may be multiple cookies that match the same host, for example, cookies set for .example.com and www.example.com will both match www.example.com, but only the former will match example.com. Likewise, cookies set for / and /foo will both match a request for /foo/bar. getCookie, setCookie and deleteCookie always operate on a single cookie, and they match the most specific one, starting with the cookies that have the longest matching domain, followed by the cookie that has the longest matching path. If the first argument is a string, they look for a cookie with that name using the hostname of the currently open page as the domain and / as the path. To be more specific, the first argument can be an object with the properties name, domain and path. The following are equivalent: browser.getCookie('session'); browser.getCookie({ name: 'session',                     domain: browser.location.hostname,                     path: browser.location.pathname }); getCookie take a second argument. If false (or missing), it returns the value of the cookie. If true, it returns an object with all the cookie properties: name, value, domain, path, expires, httpOnly and secure. browser.cookies Returns an object holding all cookies used by this browser. browser.cookies.dump(output?) Dumps all cookies to standard output, or the output stream. browser.deleteCookie(identifier) Deletes a cookie matching the identifier. The identifier is either the name of a cookie, or an object with the property name and the optional properties domain and path. browser.deleteCookies() Deletes all cookies. browser.getCookie(identifier, allProperties?) Returns a cookie matching the identifier. The identifier is either the name of a cookie, or an object with the property name and the optional properties domain and path. If allProperties is true, returns an object with all the cookie properties, otherwise returns the cookie value. browser.setCookie(name, value) Sets the value of a cookie based on its name. browser.setCookie(cookie) Sets the value of a cookie based on the following properties: domain - Domain of the cookie (requires, defaults to hostname of currently open page) expires - When cookie it set to expire (Date, optional, defaults to session) maxAge - How long before cookie expires (in seconds, defaults to session) name - Cookie name (required) path - Path for the cookie (defaults to /) httpOnly - True if HTTP-only (not accessible from client-side JavaScript, defaults to false) secure - True if secure (requires HTTPS, defaults to false) value - Cookie value (required) Tabs Just like your favorite Web browser, Zombie manages multiple open windows as tabs. New browsers start without any open tabs. As you visit the first page, Zombie will open a tab for it. All operations against the browser object operate on the currently active tab (window) and most of the time you only need to interact with that one tab. You can access it directly via browser.window. Web pages can open additional tabs using the window.open method, or whenever a link or form specifies a target (e.g. target=_blank or target=window-name). You can also open additional tabs by calling browser.open. To close the currently active tab, close the window itself. You can access all open tabs from browser.tabs. This property is an associative array, you can access each tab by its index number, and iterate over all open tabs using functions like forEach and map. If a window was opened with a name, you can also access it by its name. Since names may conflict with reserved properties/methods, you may need to use browser.tabs.find. The value of a tab is the currently active window. That window changes when you navigate forwards and backwards in history. For example, if you visited the URL '/foo' and then the URL '/bar', the first tab (browser.tabs[0]) would be a window with the document from '/bar'. If you then navigate back in history, the first tab would be the window with the document '/foo'. The following operations are used for managing tabs: browser.tabs Returns an array of all open tabs. browser.tabs[number] Returns the tab with that index number. browser.tabs[string] browser.tabs.find(string) Returns the tab with that name. browser.tabs.closeAll() Closes all tabs. browser.tabs.current This is a read/write property. It returns the currently active tab. Can also be used to change the currently active tab. You can set it to a window (e.g. as currently returned from browser.current), a window name or the tab index number. browser.tabs.dump(output?) Dump a list of all open tabs to standard output, or the output stream. browser.tabs.index Returns the index of the currently active tab. browser.tabs.length Returns the number of currently opened tabs. browser.open (url) Opens and returns a new tab. Supported options are: name - Window name. url - Load document from this URL. browser.window Returns the currently active window, same as browser.tabs.current. Debugging To see what your code is doing, you can use console.log and friends from both client-side scripts and your test code. To see everything Zombie does (opening windows, loading URLs, firing events, etc), set the environment variable DEBUG=zombie. Zombie uses the debug module. For example: $ DEBUG=zombie mocha You can also turn debugging on from your code (e.g. a specific test you're trying to troubleshoot) by calling browser.debug(). Some objects, like the browser, history, resources, tabs and windows also include dump method that will dump the current state to the console, or an output stream of your choice. For example: browser.dump(); browser.dump(process.stderr); If you want to disable console output from scripts, set browser.silent = true or once for all browser instances with Browser.silent = true. Events Each browser instance is an EventEmitter, and will emit a variety of events you can listen to. Some things you can do with events: Trace what the browser is doing, e.g. log every page loaded, every DOM event emitted, every timeout fired Wait for something to happen, e.g. form submitted, link clicked, input element getting the focus Strip out code from HTML pages, e.g remove analytics code when running tests Add event listeners to the page before any JavaScript executes Mess with the browser, e.g. modify loaded resources, capture and change DOM events console (level, message) Emitted whenever a message is printed to the console (console.log, console.error, console.trace, etc). The first argument is the logging level, and the second argument is the message. The logging levels are: debug, error, info, log, trace and warn. active (window) Emitted when this window becomes the active window. closed (window) Emitted when this window is closed. done () Emitted when the event loop goes empty. error (error) Error when loading a resource, or evaluating JavaScript. evaluated (code, result, filename) Emitted after JavaScript code is evaluated. The first argument is the JavaScript function or code (string). The second argument is the result. The third argument is the filename. event (event, target) Emitted whenever a DOM event is fired on the target element, document or window. focus (element) Emitted whenever an element receives the focus. idle () Event loop is idle. inactive (window) Emitted when this window is no longer the active window. interval (function, interval) Emitted whenever an interval (setInterval) is fired. The first argument is the function or code to evaluate, the second argument is the interval in milliseconds. link (url, target) Emitted when a link is clicked. The first argument is the URL of the new location, the second argument identifies the target window (_self, _blank, window name, etc). loaded (document) Emitted when a document has been loaded into a window or frame. This event is emitted after the HTML is parsed, and some scripts executed. loading (document) Emitted when a document is about to be loaded into a window or frame. This event is emitted when the document is still empty, before parsing any HTML. opened (window) Emitted when a new window is opened. redirect (request, response) Emitted when following a redirect. request (request) Emitted before making a request to retrieve a resource. The first argument is the request object. See Resources for more details. response (request, response) Emitted after receiving the response (excluding redirects). The first argument is the request object, the second argument is the response object. See Resources for more details. serverEvent () Browser received server initiated event (e.g. EventSource message). setInterval (function, interval) Event loop fired a setInterval event. setTimeout (function, delay) Event loop fired a setTimeout event. submit (url, target) Emitted whenever a form is submitted. The first argument is the URL of the new location, the second argument identifies the target window (_self, _blank, window name, etc). timeout (function, delay) Emitted whenever a timeout (setTimeout) is fired. The first argument is the function or code to evaluate, the second argument is the delay in milliseconds. xhr (event, url) Called for each XHR event (progress, abort, readystatechange, loadend, etc). Authentication Zombie supports HTTP basic access authentication. To provide the login credentials: browser.on('authenticate', function(authentication) {   authentication.username = 'myusername';   authentication.password = 'mypassword'; });  browser.visit('/mypage'); Resources Zombie can retrieve with resources - HTML pages, scripts, XHR requests - over HTTP, HTTPS and from the file system. Most work involving resources is done behind the scenes, but there are few notable features that you'll want to know about. Specifically, if you need to do any of the following: Inspect the history of retrieved resources, useful for troubleshooting issues related to resource loading Request resources directly, but have Zombie handle cookies, authentication, etc Implement new mechanism for retrieving resources, for example, add new protocols or support new headers (see Pipeline) The Resources List Each browser provides access to the list of resources loaded by the currently open window via browser.resources. You can iterate over this list just like any JavaScript array. Each resource provides three properties: request - The request object response - The resource object (if received) error - The error generated (no response) The request object is based on the Fetch API Request object. The response object is based on the Fetch API Response object. Note that the fetch API has the property status, whereas Node HTTP module uses statusCode. browser.fetch(input, init) You can use the browser directly to make requests against external resources. These requests will share the same cookies, authentication and other browser settings (also pipeline). The fetch method is based on the Fetch API. For example: browser.fetch(url)   .then(function(response) {     console.log('Status code:', response.status);     if (response.status === 200)       return response.text();   })   .then(function(text) {     console.log('Document:', text);   })   .catch(function(error) {     console.log('Network error');   });  To access the response document body as a Node buffer, use the following: response.arrayBuffer()   .then(Buffer) // arrayBuffer -> Buffer   .then(function(buffer) {     assert( Buffer.isBuffer(buffer) );   }); resources.dump(output?) Dumps the resources list to the output stream (defaults to standard output stream). Pipeline Zombie uses a pipeline to operate on resources. You can extend that pipeline with your own set of handlers, for example, to support additional protocols, content types, special handlers, etc. The pipeline consists of a set of handlers. There are two types of handlers: Functions with two arguments deal with requests. They are called with the browser and request object. They may modify the request object, and they may either return null (pass control to the next handler) or return the Response object, or return a promise that resolves to either outcome. Functions with three arguments deal with responses. They are called with the browser, request and response objects. They may modify the response object, and must return a Response object, either the same as the argument or a new Response object, either directly or through a promise. To add a new handle to the end of the pipeline: browser.pipeline.addHandler(function(browser, request) {   // Let's delay this request by 1/10th second   return new Promise(function(resolve) {     setTimeout(resolve, 100);   }); }); You can add handlers to all browsers via Pipeline.addHandler. These handlers are automatically added to every new browser.pipeline instance. Pipeline.addHandler(function(browser, request, response) {   // Log the response body   console.log('Response body: ' + response.body); }); Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Latest stable version: v2.0 Change Log 中文版使用文档 0. Features Run in real browsers Support all test frameworks Auto testing coverage Robust enough for actual combat 1. Installation Node requirement >= 0.10.12 Install from npm $ npm install totoro -g  If it not works, you may add sudo before the command, as follows. Install from github To get the latest function (may not be stable) $ git clone https://github.com/totorojs/totoro && cd totoro $ npm install -g  2. Quick Start For simplicity, we have already prepared an example for you: Important: please specify a server first ! $ totoro config --host={{totoroServerHost}}  For now the default test server is internal for Alibaba group only, you can launch your own server. We are planning to supply a public service, hmm... $ git clone https://github.com/totorojs/totoro && cd totoro/examples/simple $ totoro  Then you should see a output as shown below: If all test cases passed, will report in green color, or will report in red color with detailed error message. Every browser supplies it's own run time and testing coverage (if your test has source code, and totoro can recognize). Recommended directory structure Generally, if your test is a local file and the directory structure of your project is as bellow, you can run totoro without any config. project-dir/   dist/   src/ or lib/   tests/ or test/     runner.html or index.html  3. Cli Options All options are optional. 3.1 totoro -R, --runner Test runner. Accept local file and URL. Default: auto search in the CWD, runner.html or index.html in subdirectory test/ or tests/ could be recognized. -C, --code A convenient way to debug. Accept single JS expression, local file or URL. totoro will return the calculated value of expression or all output of console.log() in JS file. For example: $ totoro --code document.body $ totoro --code ""console.log(document.body)"" $ totoro --code examples/code/code.js  // this file already exists, try it!  Be mind that --code and --runner are mutually exclusive! -l, --labors Specify a comman-delimited list of app names, typically be browsers. For example: chrome,firefox,safari,ie  //just specify browser names ie/6,ie/7,ie/8,ie/9  //specify browser names and versions  Default: all available desktop browsers. -a, --adapter Test framework's adapter, used to send report to server. Accept built-in keywords, local file and URL. Built-in keywords: mocha, jasmine. If specifies no, totoro won\'t try to detect and insert any adapter, it\'s thought that user handle it by themself. It is very easy to write an adapter for custom test framework, you could refer to static/adapters/mocha.js. Default: if --runner is local file, totoro will see if there is totoro-adapter.js in the same directory , if not found or --runner is URL, totoro-server will try to find out matched keyword according to --runner content. -c, --charset Specifies charset. Default: 'utf8' -t, --timeout Specifies the client timeout in minutes. Default: 5 -O, --root If assign a local file to --runner, totoro need to launch a temporary HTTP server for testing, --root is the root of this server. See more detail Default: if necessary, guess a path according to --runner and --adapter. -H, --host totoro-server host. Default: internal server host for Alibaba group. -P, --port totoro-server port. Default: 9999 --no-proxy Won't convert the runner if it is a URL Default: false --no-coverage No need testing coverage. Default: false 3.2 totoro list Show all available browsers of specified server. 3.3 totoro config Read or write global config. Read global config $ totoro config  Write global config $ totoro config --host=10.15.52.87 --port=''  Above command clear the --port value. 4. Config File If you need a config file, just place totoro-config.json in the CWD. The priority level of all config ways are: command line > config file > totoro config > default config Below is an example for config file: {   ""browsers"": [""chrome"", ""ie/10.0""],   ""host"": ""127.0.0.1"",   ""port"": 9999 }  5.

The main purpose of Karma is to make your test-driven development easy, fast, and fun. Help and Support For questions and support please use the mailing list or Gitter. The issue tracker is for bug reports and feature discussions only. Obligatory documentation Quick questions: Longer questions: Mailing List Bug reports Issue Tracker Everything less than 140 characters: @JsKarma on Twitter When should I use Karma? You want to test code in real browsers. You want to test code in multiple browsers (desktop, mobile, tablets, etc.). You want to execute your tests locally during development. You want to execute your tests on a continuous integration server. You want to execute your tests on every save. You love your terminal. You don't want your (testing) life to suck. You want to use Istanbul to automagically generate coverage reports. You want to use RequireJS for your source files. But I still want to use _insert testing library_ Karma is not a testing framework, nor an assertion library. Karma just launches a HTTP server, and generates the test runner HTML file you probably already know from your favourite testing framework. So for testing purposes you can use pretty much anything you like. There are already plugins for most of the common testing frameworks: Jasmine Mocha QUnit and many others If you can't find an adapter for your favourite framework, don't worry and write your own. It's not that hard and we are here to help. Which Browsers can I use? All the major browsers are supported, if you want to know more see the browsers page. Troubleshooting See FAQ. I want to use it. Where do I sign? You don't need to sign anything but here are some resources to help you to get started... Obligatory Screencast. Every serious project has a screencast, so here is ours. Just click here and let the show begin. Installation. See installation. Using it. See configuration. This is so great. I want to help. Please, see contributing. Why did you create this? Throughout the development of AngularJS, we've been using JSTD for testing. I really think that JSTD is a great idea. Unfortunately, we had many problems with JSTD, so we decided to write our own test runner based on the same idea. We wanted a simple tool just for executing JavaScript tests that is both stable and fast. That's why we use the awesome Socket.io library and Node.js. My boss wants a license. So where is it?

To set up your own instance of yolpo to develop with, use any light-weight web-server to host the files and folders in /website/. yolpo is a 100% clientside solution so all your webserver needs to do is serve static pages. A simple build process is in place to ensure that that files are combined and minified before being served by the main site. Issues and Contribution Guidelines Thanks for reading this and wanting to help make yolpo better ! First things first, though: my code is quite messy at the moment and likely to stay that way for a while; I don’t expect anybody to go there and make it better; besides I can work on this project only a few hours some weekends and very rarely some late evenings on week days so I would not have much time to merge pull requests. Instead, I would welcome feedback, ideas and issue reporting. Also, it would be great if you could write github gists against any javascript api and let me know about them. I would be very happy to add them in the explore page. Happy hacking! A misty road map There are many things I would like to add in yolpo. Here are a few: better option to display interim results option to get underlying gist from GitHub. concept of playlist - similar concept of a playlist for a video player much better UI and UX - the UI and UX need to significantly improve. Currently editing is particularly unintuitive. isomorphic API - currently yolpo's code is heavily dependent on some key dom components (e.g. IFrame for sandboxing the execution) GitHub sign in integration Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

It is very flexible so you can easily adjust it to your particular coding guidelines and the environment you expect your code to execute in. JSHint is open source and will always stay this way. Our goal The goal of this project is to help JavaScript developers write complex programs without worrying about typos and language gotchas. Any code base eventually becomes huge at some point, and simple mistakes—that would not show themselves when written—can become show stoppers and waste hours of debugging. And this is when static code analysis tools come into play and help developers to spot such problems. JSHint scans a program written in JavaScript and reports about commonly made mistakes and potential bugs. The potential problem could be a syntax error, a bug due to implicit type conversion, a leaking variable or something else. Only 15% of all programs linted on jshint.com pass the JSHint checks. In all other cases, JSHint finds some red flags that could've been bugs or potential problems. Please note, that while static code analysis tools can spot many different kind of mistakes, it can't detect if your program is correct, fast or has memory leaks. You should always combine tools like JSHint with unit and functional tests as well as with code reviews. Reporting a bug To report a bug simply create a new GitHub Issue and describe your problem or suggestion. We welcome all kinds of feedback regarding JSHint including but not limited to: When JSHint doesn't work as expected When JSHint complains about valid JavaScript code that works in all browsers When you simply want a new option or feature Before reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets that cover your issue. And remember the wisdom: pull request > bug report > tweet. Who uses JSHint? Engineers from these companies and projects use JSHint: Mozilla Wikipedia Facebook Twitter Bootstrap Disqus Medium Yahoo! SmugMug jQuery PDF.js Coursera Adobe Brackets Apache Cordova RedHat SoundCloud Nodejitsu Yelp Voxer EnyoJS QuickenLoans oDesk Cloud9 CodeClimate Pandoo TEK Zendesk Apache CouchDB And many more!

A directory path will recurse over all *.js files in the directory. Note that the AST options (--ast and --save-ast) are experimental and may be removed. Formatting For formatting jsfmt uses esformatter. .jsfmtrc Any of the esformatter formatting options can be overwritten via a .jsfmtrc file. The file is parsed using rc, which accepts either a json or ini formatted file. A .jsfmtrc will be read if it exists in any of the following directories: a local .jsfmtrc or the first found looking in ./ ../ ../../ ../../../ etc. $HOME/.jsfmtrc $HOME/.jsfmt/config $HOME/.config/jsfmt $HOME/.config/jsfmt/config /etc/jsfmtrc /etc/jsfmt/config jsfmt will also attempt to pickup and use the configured indent variable from your .jshintrc configuration file, if present. Rewriting The --rewrite flag allows rewriting portions of the JavaScript's AST before formatting. This is especially handy for intelligent renaming and handling API changes from a library. The rewrite rule must be a string of the form: pattern -> replacement  Both pattern and replacement must be valid JavaScript. In pattern, single-character lowercase identifiers serve as wildcards matching arbitrary expressions; those expressions will be substituted for the same identifiers in the replacement. Example Rewrite occurences of _.reduce to use native reduce: jsfmt --rewrite ""_.reduce(a, b, c) -> a.reduce(b, c)"" reduce.js  Searching The --search flag allows searching through a JavaScript's AST. The search rule is very similar to the rewrite rule but just outputs expressions that match the given search expression. The search expression must be valid JavaScript. Example Find occurences of _.reduce: jsfmt --search ""_.reduce(a, b, c)"" reduce.js  Validating The --validate flag will print any errors found by esprima while parsing the JavaScript. Example jsfmt --validate bad.js  API Formatting jsfmt.format(<javascript_string>, <config_object>) // Returns formatted JavaScript jsfmt.formatJSON(<JSON_string>, <config_object>) // Returns formatted JSON var config = jsfmt.getConfig(); // Loads the jsfmt config from the appropriate rc file or default config object Example var jsfmt = require('jsfmt'); var fs = require('fs');  var js = fs.readFileSync('unformatted.js'); var config = jsfmt.getConfig();  js = jsfmt.format(js, config); Rewriting jsfmt.rewrite(<javascript_string>, <rewrite_rule>) // Returns rewritten JavaScript Example var jsfmt = require('jsfmt'); var fs = require('fs');  var js = fs.readFileSync('each.js');  js = jsfmt.rewrite(js, ""_.each(a, b) -> a.forEach(b)""); Searching jsfmt.search(<javascript_string>, <search_expression>) // Returns array of matches Example var jsfmt = require('jsfmt'); var fs = require('fs');  var js = fs.readFileSync('component.js');  jsfmt.search(js, ""R.Component.create(a, { dependencies: z })"").forEach(function(matches, wildcards) {   console.log(wildcards.z); }); Validating jsfmt.validate(<javascript_string>) // Returns errors found while parsing JavaScript jsfmt.validateJSON(<JSON_string>) // Returns errors found while parsing JSON Example var jsfmt = require('jsfmt'); var fs = require('fs');  var js = fs.readFileSync('each.js'); var errors = jsfmt.validate(js);  for (var i = 0; i < errors.length; i++) {   console.error(errors[i]); } Plugins Since jsfmt uses esformatter under the covers for formatting your code you can utilize any esformatter plugins with jsfmt. Please see https://github.com/millermedeiros/esformatter/#plugins for more information. JSX There exists a plugin esformatter-jsx which provides support for formatting JSX with esformatter.

The inspector identifies duplicate code, even if modified, as well as common boilerplate or logic that should be the target of refactoring. Overview Installation Usage Integration Reporters Performance Overview We've all had to deal with code smell, and duplicate code is a common source. While some instances are easy to spot, this type of searching is the perfect use-case for a helpful CLI tool. Existing solutions do exist for this purpose, but are often token-based and rely on string searching methods such as the Rabin–Karp algorithm. Why isn't this always ideal? Those tools may struggle with code that has wildly varying identifiers, despite having the same structure and behavior. And copy-pasted code is but one type of code duplication. Common boilerplate and repeated logic can be identified as well using jsinspect, since it doesn't work on tokens - it uses the ASTs of the parsed code. You have the freedom to specify a threshold determining the smallest subset of nodes to analyze. This will identify code with a similar structure, based on the AST node types, e.g. BlockStatement, VariableDeclaration, ObjectExpression, etc. For copy-paste oriented detection, you can even limit the search to nodes with matching identifiers. The tool accepts a list of paths to parse, and outputs any matches along with a series of 2-way diffs. Any directories among the paths are walked recursively, and only .js files are analyzed. Any node_modules and bower_components dirs are also ignored. Being built for JavaScript, it also ignores ES6 module declarations, CommonJS require statements, and AMD define expressions. Installation It can be installed via npm using: npm install -g jsinspect Also available: grunt-jsinspect, and gulp-jsinspect Usage Usage: jsinspect [options] <paths ...>  Duplicate code and structure detection for JavaScript. Identifier matching is disabled by default. Example use: jsinspect -t 30 -i --ignore ""Test.js"" ./path/to/src   Options:    -h, --help                         output usage information   -V, --version                      output the version number   -t, --threshold <number>           number of nodes (default: 15)   -i, --identifiers                  match identifiers   -m, --matches <number>             min number of instances for a match (default: 2)   -j, --jsx                          support jsx files (default: false)   -c, --config                       path to config file (default: .jsinspectrc)   -r, --reporter [default|json|pmd]  specify the reporter to use   -s, --suppress <number>            length to suppress diffs (default: 100, off: 0)   -D, --no-diff                      disable 2-way diffs   -C, --no-color                     disable colors   --ignore <pattern>                 ignore paths matching a regex  If a .jsinspectrc file is located in the project directory, its values will be used in place of the defaults listed above. For example: {   ""threshold"":     30,   ""identifiers"":   true,   ""matches"":       2,   ""ignore"":        ""Test.js|Spec.js"", // used as RegExp,   ""jsx"":           true,   ""reporter"":      ""json"",   ""suppress"":      100, } On first use with a project, you may want to run the tool with the following options, while running explicitly on the lib/src directories, and not the test/spec dir. jsinspect -t 30 -i ./path/to/src  From there, feel free to try incrementally decreasing the threshold and ignoring identifiers. A threshold of 20 may lead you to discover new areas of interest for refactoring or cleanup. Each project or library may be different. Integration It's simple to run jsinspect on your library source as part of a build process. It will exit with an error code of 0 when no matches are found, resulting in a passing step, and a positive error code corresponding to its failure. For example, with Travis CI, you could add the following entries to your .travis.yml: before_script:   - ""npm install -g jsinspect""  script:   - ""jsinspect -t 30 ./path/to/src"" Note that in the above example, we're using a threshold of 30 for detecting structurally similar code. A lower threshold may work for your build process, but ~30 should help detect unnecessary boilerplate, while avoiding excessive output. To have jsinspect run with each job, but not block or fail the build, you can use something like the following: script:   - ""jsinspect -t 30 ./path/to/src || true"" Reporters Aside from the default reporter, both JSON and PMD CPD-style XML reporters are available. Note that in the JSON example below, indentation and formatting has been applied. Furthermore, the id property available in these reporters is useful for parsing by automatic scripts to determine whether or not duplicate code has changed between builds.

Let Buddy sniff out the unnamed numerical constants in your code. Overview What are magic numbers? Installation Usage Integration Reporters Ignoring numbers Overview We all know magic numbers are frowned upon as a programming practice. They may give no indication of their meaning, and when used multiple times, can result in future inconsistencies. They can expose you to the risk of typos, hinder maintenance and have an impact on readability. That's where Buddy comes in. Buddy is a cli tool that's eager to find the magic numbers in your code. It accepts a list of paths to parse, and renders any found instances with the selected reporter. In the case of directories, they're walked recursively, and only .js files are analyzed. Any node_modules dirs are also ignored. Since const is not widespread in JavaScript, it defaults to searching for numbers which are not the sole literal in an object expression or variable declaration. Furthermore, specific values can be ignored, such as 0 and 1, which are ignored by default. Who's a good boy? What are magic numbers? Magic numbers are unnamed numerical constants, though the term can sometimes be used to refer to other literals as well. Take the following contrived example: function getTotal(subtotal) {   var beforeTax = subtotal + 9.99;   return beforeTax + (beforeTax * 0.13); } In the above function, the meaning of the two numbers might not be clear. What is this 9.99 charge? In our case, let's say it's a shipping rate. And what about the 0.13? It's the sales tax. Buddy will highlight those two instances: $ buddy example.js  example.js:2 | var beforeTax = subtotal + 9.99; example.js:3 | return beforeTax + (beforeTax * 0.13);   2 magic numbers found across 1 file  If the tax rate was used in multiple locations, it's prone to human error. And it might not be immediately clear that the 9.99 charge is a flat rate shipping cost, which can affect maintenance. So how would this be improved? var FLAT_SHIPPING_COST = 9.99; var SALES_TAX = 0.13;  function getTotal(subtotal) {   var beforeTax = subtotal + FLAT_SHIPPING_COST;   return beforeTax + (beforeTax * SALES_TAX); } Or, depending on your target platforms or browsers, by using the const keyword for variable declaration instead of var. While const is available in Node, you should take note of its browser compatibility for front end JavaScript. $ buddy example.js   No magic numbers found across 1 file  Installation It can be installed via npm using: npm install -g buddy.js  Also available: grunt-buddyjs, and gulp-buddy.js Usage Usage: buddy [options] <paths ...>  Options:    -h, --help                             output usage information   -V, --version                          output the version number   -d, --detect-objects                   detect object expressions and properties   -e, --enforce-const                    require literals to be defined using const   -i, --ignore <numbers>                 list numbers to ignore (default: 0,1)   -I, --disable-ignore                   disables the ignore list   -r, --reporter [simple|detailed|json]  specify reporter to use (default: simple)   -C, --no-color                         disables colors  If a .buddyrc file is located in the project directory, its values will be used in place of the defaults listed above. For example: {   ""detectObjects"": false,   ""enforceConst"":  false,   ""ignore"":        [0, 1, 2], // Use empty array to disable ignore   ""reporter"":      ""detailed"" } Integration You can easily run Buddy on your library source as part of your build. It will exit with an error code of 0 when no magic numbers were found. Otherwise it will return a positive error code, and result in a failing build. For example, with Travis CI, you can add the following two entries to your .travis.yml: before_script:   - ""npm install -g buddy.js""  script:   - ""buddy ./path/to/src""  Reporters For additional context, try using the detailed reporter. Or, for logging output and integration with your quality assurance process, the json reporter can be used. Ignoring numbers A magic number can be ignored in any of three ways: Its value is ignored using the --ignore flag The line includes the following comment buddy ignore:line The line is located between a buddy ignore:start and buddy ignore:end Given the following example, two magic numbers exist that could be ignored: var SECOND = 1000; var MINUTE = 60 * SECOND; var HOUR = 60 * MINUTE; Using the command line option, you can run buddy with: buddy example.js --ignore 60. Or, if preferred, you can specify that the instances be ignored on a case-by-case basis: var SECOND = 1000; var MINUTE = 60 * SECOND; // buddy ignore:line var HOUR = 60 * MINUTE; // buddy ignore:line Or better yet, you can make use of directives to ignore all magic numbers within a range: // buddy ignore:start var SECOND = 1000; var MINUTE = 60 * SECOND; var HOUR = 60 * MINUTE; // buddy ignore:end Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions: ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing. ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code. ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime. Installation and Usage There are two ways to install ESLint: globally and locally. Local Installation and Usage If you want to include ESLint as part of your project's build system, we recommend installing it locally. You can do so using npm: $ npm install eslint --save-dev  You should then setup a configuration file: $ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init  After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this: $ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint yourfile.js  Any plugins or shareable configs that you use must also be installed locally to work with a locally-installed ESLint. Global Installation and Usage If you want to make ESLint available to tools that run across all of your projects, we recommend installing ESLint globally. You can do so using npm: $ npm install -g eslint  You should then setup a configuration file: $ eslint --init  After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this: $ eslint yourfile.js  Any plugins or shareable configs that you use must also be installed globally to work with a globally-installed ESLint. Note: eslint --init is intended for setting up and configuring ESLint on a per-project basis and will perform a local installation of ESLint and its plugins in the directory in which it is run. If you prefer using a global installation of ESLint, any plugins used in your configuration must also be installed globally. Configuration After running eslint --init, you'll have a .eslintrc file in your directory. In it, you'll see some rules configured like this: {     ""rules"": {         ""semi"": [""error"", ""always""],         ""quotes"": [""error"", ""double""]     } } The names ""semi"" and ""quotes"" are the names of rules in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values: ""off"" or 0 - turn the rule off ""warn"" or 1 - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn't affect exit code) ""error"" or 2 - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1) The three error levels allow you fine-grained control over how ESLint applies rules (for more configuration options and details, see the configuration docs).

Filing Issues Before filing an issue, please be sure to read the guidelines for what you're reporting: Bug Report Propose a New Rule Proposing a Rule Change Request a Change Semantic Versioning Policy ESLint follows semantic versioning. However, due to the nature of ESLint as a code quality tool, it's not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs. To help clarify this for everyone, we've defined the following semantic versioning policy for ESLint: Patch release (intended to not break your lint build) A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting fewer errors. A bug fix to the CLI or core (including formatters). Improvements to documentation. Non-user-facing changes such as refactoring code, adding, deleting, or modifying tests, and increasing test coverage. Re-releasing after a failed release (i.e., publishing a release that doesn't work for anyone). Minor release (might break your lint build) A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting more errors. A new rule is created. A new option to an existing rule is created. An existing rule is deprecated. A new CLI capability is created. New capabilities to the public API are added (new classes, new methods, new arguments to existing methods, etc.). A new formatter is created. Major release (likely to break your lint build) eslint:recommended is updated. An existing rule is removed. An existing formatter is removed. Part of the public API is removed or changed in an incompatible way. Frequently Asked Questions How is ESLint different from JSHint? The most significant difference is that ESlint has pluggable linting rules. That means you can use the rules it comes with, or you can extend it with rules created by others or by yourself! How does ESLint performance compare to JSHint? ESLint is slower than JSHint, usually 2-3x slower on a single file. This is because ESLint uses Espree to construct an AST before it can evaluate your code whereas JSHint evaluates your code as it's being parsed. The speed is also based on the number of rules you enable; the more rules you enable, the slower the process. Despite being slower, we believe that ESLint is fast enough to replace JSHint without causing significant pain. I heard ESLint is going to replace JSCS? Yes. Since we are solving the same problems, ESLint and JSCS teams have decided to join forces and work together in the development of ESLint instead of competing with each other. You can read more about this in both ESLint and JSCS announcements. So, should I stop using JSCS and start using ESLint? Not yet. We are still working to smooth the transition. You can see our progress here. We’ll announce when all of the changes necessary to support JSCS users in ESLint are complete and will start encouraging JSCS users to switch to ESLint at that time. Meanwhile, we recommend you to upgrade to JSCS 3.0 and provide feedback to the team. Is ESLint just linting or does it also check style? ESLint does both traditional linting (looking for problematic patterns) and style checking (enforcement of conventions). You can use it for both. Does ESLint support JSX? Yes, ESLint natively supports parsing JSX syntax (this must be enabled in configuration.). Please note that supporting JSX syntax is not the same as supporting React. React applies specific semantics to JSX syntax that ESLint doesn't recognize. We recommend using eslint-plugin-react if you are using React and want React semantics. What about ECMAScript 6 support? ESLint has full support for ECMAScript 6. By default, this support is off. You can enable ECMAScript 6 support through configuration. What about experimental features? ESLint doesn't natively support experimental ECMAScript language features. You can use babel-eslint to use any option available in Babel. Once a language feature has been adopted into the ECMAScript standard, we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature, subject to our contributing guidelines. Until then, please use the appropriate parser and plugin(s) for your experimental feature. Where to ask for help?

It parses and analyzes a source file, returning an object with information about the file. It can also take an object that sets options.  jslint.html runs the jslint.js function in a web page. The page also depends on adsafe.js [https://github.com/douglascrockford/ADsafe] (which is not included in this project) and browser.js and report.js (which are).  browser.js runs the web user interface.  report.js generates the results reports in HTML.  help.html describes JSLint's usage. Please read it.  function.html describes the jslint function and the results it produces.  Please direct questions and comments to https://plus.google.com/communities/104441363299760713736.  JSLint can be run anywhere that JavaScript (or Java) can run.  The place to express yourself in programming is in the quality of your ideas and the efficiency of their execution. The role of style in programming is the same as in literature: It makes for better reading. A great writer doesn't express herself by putting the spaces before her commas instead of after, or by putting extra spaces inside her parentheses. A great writer will slavishly conform to some rules of style, and that in no way constrains her power to express herself creatively. See for example William Strunk's The Elements of Style [http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style.html].  This applies to programming as well. Conforming to a consistent style improves readability, and frees you to express yourself in ways that matter. JSLint here plays the part of a stern but benevolent editor, helping you to get the style right so that you can focus your creative energy where it is most needed.

It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control. It also helps with server-side communication, taming async callbacks with promises and deferreds, and it makes client-side navigation and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of cake. Best of all? It makes development fun!

What to use AngularJS for and when to use it AngularJS is the next generation framework where each component is designed to work with every other component in an interconnected way like a well-oiled machine. AngularJS is JavaScript MVC made easy and done right. (Well it is not really MVC, read on, to understand what this means.) MVC, no, MV* done the right way! MVC, short for Model-View-Controller, is a design pattern, i.e. how the code should be organized and how the different parts of an application separated for proper readability and debugging. Model is the data and the database. View is the user interface and what the user sees. Controller is the main link between Model and View. These are the three pillars of major programming frameworks present on the market today. On the other hand AngularJS works on MV*, short for Model-View-Whatever. The Whatever is AngularJS's way of telling that you may create any kind of linking between the Model and the View here. Unlike other frameworks in any programming language, where MVC, the three separate components, each one has to be written and then connected by the programmer, AngularJS helps the programmer by asking him/her to just create these and everything else will be taken care of by AngularJS. Interconnection with HTML at the root level AngularJS uses HTML to define the user's interface. AngularJS also enables the programmer to write new HTML tags (AngularJS Directives) and increase the readability and understandability of the HTML code. Directives are AngularJS’s way of bringing additional functionality to HTML. Directives achieve this by enabling us to invent our own HTML elements. This also helps in making the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), which means once created, a new directive can be used anywhere within the application. Data Handling made simple Data and Data Models in AngularJS are plain JavaScript objects and one can add and change properties directly on it and loop over objects and arrays at will. Two-way Data Binding One of AngularJS's strongest features. Two-way Data Binding means that if something changes in the Model, the change gets reflected in the View instantaneously, and the same happens the other way around. This is also referred to as Reactive Programming, i.e. suppose a = b + c is being programmed and after this, if the value of b and/or c is changed then the value of a will be automatically updated to reflect the change. AngularJS uses its ""scopes"" as a glue between the Model and View and makes these updates in one available for the other. Less Written Code and Easily Maintainable Code Everything in AngularJS is created to enable the programmer to end up writing less code that is easily maintainable and readable by any other new person on the team. Believe it or not, one can write a complete working two-way data binded application in less than 10 lines of code. Try and see for yourself! Testing Ready AngularJS has Dependency Injection, i.e. it takes care of providing all the necessary dependencies to its controllers whenever required. This helps in making the AngularJS code ready for unit testing by making use of mock dependencies created and injected. This makes AngularJS more modular and easily testable thus in turn helping a team create more robust applications. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

If you would like to help improve this documentation, the source for many of the docs can be found in the doc folder within this repository. Other docs, not related to the general framework, but directed at specific libraries, can be found in the doc folder of those libraries. Platform Support This library can be used in the browser only. Building The Code To build the code, follow these steps. Ensure that NodeJS is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs. From the project folder, execute the following command: npm install Ensure that Gulp is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command: npm install -g gulp To build the code, you can now run: gulp build You will find the compiled code in the dist folder, available in three module formats: AMD, CommonJS and ES6. See gulpfile.js for other tasks related to generating the docs and linting. Running The Tests To run the unit tests, first ensure that you have followed the steps above in order to install all dependencies and successfully build the library. Once you have done that, proceed with these additional steps: Ensure that the Karma CLI is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command: npm install -g karma-cli Ensure that jspm is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command: npm install -g jspm Install the client-side dependencies with jspm: jspm install You can now run the tests with this command: karma start Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Batman is sleeping. Batman.js is no longer in production at Shopify and is not actively developed. :( batman.js batman.js is a framework for building rich single-page browser applications. It's got: A stateful MVC architecture that emphasizes object-oriented design, convention over configuration, and communication via REST. A developer-friendly API inspired by Ruby on Rails and designed for CoffeeScript. Powerful two-way data binding. Every property tracks its sources and updates automatically when its sources change. Pure HTML templates so you can use whatever templating engine you like. Liquid-style filters make designers & developers feel right at home. Lots more: expressive routing, model validations, model associations, I18n, localStorage persistence... To find out more or get started with batman.js, check out the website: http://batmanjs.org. Contributing Well-tested contributions are always welcome! Here's what you should do: 1. Clone the repo git clone git@github.com:batmanjs/batman.git 2. Install dependencies using NPM npm install npm install -g gulp If you don't already have Node.js, the installation instructions are here. 3. Run the tests batman.js uses karma and QUnit for orchestrating tests. To run the tests, run the following command from the project root: gulp # starts webpack & karma Assuming you have Chrome installed, it should automatically open and start running the tests. The test outcome will appear in your terminal. 4. Write some test-driven code The tests are in tests/batman. All test files in there are automatically picked up and run. 5. Update the documentation The API documentation is written using literate CoffeeScript. The API documentation includes its own set of tests, which serves as both an assurance that the API hasn't broken, as well as a set of examples for how to use it. These tests need not be comprehensive (that's what the regular tests are for), but should cover the most common use cases. They're automatically run alongside the regular tests, so you don't need to run them manually. If you want to render the API docs, see the README for batmanjs.github.io. Please read the README for the docs before writing any. 6. Create a pull request If it's good code that fits with the goals of the project, we'll merge it in! Compiling the library Task Does... gulp Does it all: starts Karma and watches for changes, running finalize on any change gulp build compiles files into /dist gulp finalize runs build and creates minified versions gulp test starts Karma runner gulp test:travis finalizes then runs the tests once with PhantomJS License batman.js is copyright 2014 by Shopify, released under the MIT License (see LICENSE for details).

It is focused on making you, the developer, as productive as possible by doing all the common, repetitive, yet essential, tasks involved in most web development projects. Ember.js also provides access to the most advanced features of Javascript, HTML and the Browser giving you everything you need to create your next killer web app. Website Guides API Community Blog Builds Building Ember.js Ensure that Node.js and bower are installed. Run git clone https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js.git && cd ember.js. Run git config core.symlinks true to ensure that symlinks are enabled. Run git reset --hard HEAD to reset to HEAD with symlinks. Run npm install to ensure the required dependencies are installed. Run bower install to ensure required web dependencies are installed. Run npm run build to build Ember.js. The builds will be placed in the dist/ directory. npm install troubleshooting If you encounter a problem with downloading dependencies like: npm ERR! registry error parsing json  consider upgrading npm with: npm install -g npm@latest  You can find more information in Upgrading on *nix (OSX, Linux, etc.) npm wiki page. Contribution See CONTRIBUTING.md How to Run Unit Tests Pull requests should pass the Ember.js unit tests. Do the following to run these tests. Follow the setup steps listed above under Building Ember.js. To start the development server, run npm start. To run all tests, visit http://localhost:4200/. To test a specific package, visit http://localhost:4200/tests/index.html?package=PACKAGE_NAME. Replace PACKAGE_NAME with the name of the package you want to test. For example: Ember.js Runtime Ember.js Views Ember.js Handlebars To test multiple packages, you can separate them with commas. You can also pass jquery=VERSION in the test URL to test different versions of jQuery. From the CLI Install phantomjs from http://phantomjs.org. Run npm test to run a basic test suite or run TEST_SUITE=all npm test to run a more comprehensive suite. From ember-cli ember test --server connect the browsers you want if phantom didn't connect automatically, you can run ./bin/connect-phantom-to <optional-port> To run a specific browser, you can use the --launch flag ember test --server --launch SL_Firefox_Current ember test --launch SL_Firefox_Current Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Jul 8, 2016 meteor.bat Create a folder ""tool-env"" Jul 31, 2015 README.md Meteor Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web applications. With Meteor you write apps: in pure JavaScript that send data over the wire, rather than HTML using your choice of popular open-source libraries Try the getting started tutorial. Next, read the guide or the reference documentation at http://docs.meteor.com/. Quick Start Install Meteor: curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh Create a project: meteor create try-meteor Run it: cd try-meteor meteor Slow Start (for developers) If you want to run on the bleeding edge, or help develop Meteor, you can run Meteor directly from a git checkout. git clone git://github.com/meteor/meteor.git cd meteor If you're the sort of person who likes to build everything from scratch, you can build all the Meteor dependencies (node.js, npm, mongodb, etc) with the provided script. This requires git, a C and C++ compiler, autotools, and scons. If you do not run this script, Meteor will automatically download pre-compiled binaries when you first run it. # OPTIONAL ./scripts/generate-dev-bundle.sh Now you can run meteor directly from the checkout (if you did not build the dependency bundle above, this will take a few moments to download a pre-build version). ./meteor --help From your checkout, you can read the docs locally. The /docs directory is a meteor application, so simply change into the /docs directory and launch the app: cd docs/ ../meteor You'll then be able to read the docs locally in your browser at http://localhost:3000/. Note that if you run Meteor from a git checkout, you cannot pin apps to specific Meteor releases or run using different Meteor releases using --release. Uninstalling Meteor Aside from a short launcher shell script, Meteor installs itself inside your home directory. To uninstall Meteor, run: rm -rf ~/.meteor/ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/meteor Developer Resources Building an application with Meteor?

It's a JavaScript library for building reactive user interfaces in a way that doesn't force you into a particular framework's way of thinking. It takes a radically different approach to DOM manipulation - one that saves both you and the browser unnecessary work. Features include... Data-binding, with a beautiful declarative syntax. Event handling that doesn't make you tear your hair out. Flexible and performant animations and transitions. And much more! To get a feel for how it will make your life as a web developer easier, visit ractivejs.org, follow the interactive tutorials, or try the 60 second setup. Documentation and Help If you don't find what you're looking for in the docs, here are other channels you can ask: Create a new issue on Github. Ask a question on Google Groups. Ask a question on Stack Overflow with the ractivejs tag. Send us a tweet via @RactiveJS. Contributing Pull requests and issues are always welcome! Please read CONTRIBUTING.md to learn how to contribute. Development If you want to hack on Ractive, the first step is to fork the repo. Then do the following commands. # Clone your fork of the repo git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ractive  # Move into the repo directory cd ractive  # Install the dependencies npm install  # Run a server for development npm start Navigate to localhost:4567. You'll see: ractive-legacy.js - A build of Ractive that includes legacy browser support. sandbox - Contains some template files to help with debugging. test - The test suite. To start development, copy the sandbox/sample, following the instructions therein. After the initial build, any subsequent changes will result in fast incremental rebuilds. If you're using Chrome, you can use the LiveReload plugin. The development server is served by gobble and is still in development. Please report any Gobble-related bugs to Gobble's issue tracker. Thanks! Build To build, the following must be met: A real shell. Linux and OS X should be good. Windows needs MSYS or something similar at least on the path. On Windows, if you get an EINVAL when running the tests, you may need to update the phantomjs script in the node_modules/.bin to use { stdio: 'inherit' } when spawning the child process instead of manually piping afterwards. To run a complete build including linting, testing and minification: npm run build Browser support Tested successfully in IE8+ and all modern browsers. For legacy browser support, use the builds with suffix legacy in the filename. These builds include polyfills and other essential features required by Ractive.

It uses observers to make your UI automatically stay in sync with an underlying data model, along with a powerful and extensible set of declarative bindings to enable productive development. Getting started Totally new to Knockout? The most fun place to start is the online interactive tutorials. For more details, see Documentation on the project's website Online examples at http://knockoutjs.com/examples/ Downloading Knockout You can download released versions of Knockout from the project's website. For Node.js developers, Knockout is also available from npm - just run npm install knockout. Building Knockout from sources If you prefer to build the library yourself: Clone the repo from GitHub git clone https://github.com/knockout/knockout.git cd knockout  Acquire build dependencies. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your workstation. This is only needed to build Knockout from sources. Knockout itself has no dependency on Node.js once it is built (it works with any server technology or none). Now run: npm install -g grunt-cli npm install  The first npm command sets up the popular Grunt build tool. You might need to run this command with sudo if you're on Linux or Mac OS X, or in an Administrator command prompt on Windows. The second npm command fetches the remaining build dependencies. Run the build tool grunt  Now you'll find the built files in build/output/. Running the tests If you have phantomjs installed, then the grunt script will automatically run the specification suite and report its results. Or, if you want to run the specs in a browser (e.g., for debugging), simply open spec/runner.html in your browser.

Spine gives you structure and then gets out of your way, allowing you to concentrate on the fun stuff: building awesome web applications. Spine is opinionated in its approach to web application architecture and design. Spine's architecture complements patterns such as de-coupled components and CommonJS modules, markedly helping with code quality and maintainability. The library is written in CoffeeScript, and though it doesn't necessarily require CoffeeScript to develop applications - you can use whichever language you're most familiar with or prefer - the documentation and some associated tools like Hem and spine.app cater to those who prefer CoffeeScript's syntax. Learn it Documentation is often incomplete or just lies waiting to happen. Approachable source code reduces knowledge dependencies. This is an area where Spine really excells compared to other MVC frameworks. Spine is tiny; the core library comes in at less than 700 lines of CoffeeScript code. It is written in such a way to prefer readability over terseness or clever tricks, and it is small enough that within a rather small timeframe you can understand how all the pieces work together. Expertise is achievable within days or weeks rather than months or years. For these reasons, remaining lightweight and simple is fundamental to Spine. For documentation, usage, and examples, see: spinejs.com The test suite can also occasionally provide additional useful examples, especially if you are looking for non-coffeescript examples. Contributing Reporting issues To file a bug report, please visit the GitHub issues page. It's great if you can attach code (test cases and fixes for bugs, and test cases and a proposed implementation for features), but reproducible bug reports are also welcome. For support or help with using spine please use the Spine Google Group and/or StackOverflow rather than opening an issue on Github. If you post in those places you are more likely to get more people to chime in, and others can benefit from it more readily. Cloning master and running the test suite To get started contributing to Spine, first clone the repository and make sure you can run the test suite. If you're not familiar with Git, visit the Git homepage to download Git for your platform. First, clone the repository: $ git clone git://github.com/spine/spine.git $ cd spine  Next, You will need node and npm to pull in the testing libraries. Once you're all set with those then from within the Spine repo directory run $ npm install  This will install CoffeeScript and the Karma test runner. At this point you can easily run the complete test suite using $ npm test  But this isn't very practical for development, since it runs the test suite multiple times agains different versions of jQuery. A better approach is to install the Karma CLI $ npm install -g karma-cli  Then you can use $ karma start to run the tests using the latest stable version of jQuery. Karma will keep running in the background and re-run tests whenever you change any files. When the Karma server is running, you can debug tests in your browser by visiting http://localhost:9876/debug.html. It's also possible to test agains a specific version of jQuery if needed: $ JQUERY_VERSION=1.9.1 karma start. Contributing to the Spine documentation Perhaps the easiest way to get started with contributing is through the docs. If you find typos, bugs, or omissions in the docs, please submit a pull request to fix. The Spine website spinejs.com, which is the primary documentation, is a very simple rails app spine.site. You don't need to know Rails or Ruby to contribute. The vast majority of it is in Markdown Contributing to the Spine code This recommended contribution process is based on the Ruby on Rails contribution guide. In general, please include tests with new features or bugfixes, work in a feature branch until you're ready to submit or discuss your code, then fork the repository, push to your fork, and issue a pull request. CoffeeScript When submitting a pull request for code, please submit in CoffeeScript. Building the effected js files is required for testing sake, but submitting those js files is optional. Assuming you have Node.js and npm already installed then proceed by installing local dev dependencies: $ npm install  Then use the provided build scripts to compile your CoffeeScript files: $ cake build $ cake watch  These tasks use a locally installed copy of CoffeeScript to ensure all contributors use the same version of the compiler. Git Let's say I'm going to submit a patch to add someFeatureFix: $ git checkout dev  Feature branches should start from dev not master. If you branch off of, or do builds on the master branch you will get CoffeeScript source map files, which are cool, but tend to ruin automatic merges with git. $ git checkout -b someFeatureFix $ vim test/...   # (...add tests...) $ cake watch   # (...this should recompile and changes you make in your CoffeeScript...)  -- figure out what spine module your changes belong in $ vim src/spine.coffee or $ vim src/[otherSpineComponent].coffee   # (...add the feature/fix...) $ open test/index.html   # (...make sure tests run for each component that was changed...)   # (...test in other browsers with various jquery versions if you feel like there is risk... ) $ git commit -m ""Add Some Feature Fix""  Then, fork the Spine repository, and push your branch to your fork: $ git remote add <your user name> git@github.com:<your user name>/spine.git $ git push <your user name> someFeatureFix  Finally, issue a pull request from inside the GitHub interface to the dev branch of spine, and your contribution is ready for consideration, discussion, and (hopefully) merging in!

Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug. Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM. Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native. Learn how to use React in your own project. Examples We have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you started: var HelloMessage = React.createClass({   render: function() {     return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;   } });  ReactDOM.render(   <HelloMessage name=""John"" />,   document.getElementById('container') ); This example will render ""Hello John"" into a container on the page. You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. A simple transform is included with React that allows converting JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest. Installation The fastest way to get started is to serve JavaScript from the CDN (also available on cdnjs and jsdelivr): <!-- The core React library --> <script src=""https://fb.me/react-15.2.0.js""></script> <!-- The ReactDOM Library --> <script src=""https://fb.me/react-dom-15.2.0.js""></script> We've also built a starter kit which might be useful if this is your first time using React. It includes a webpage with an example of using React with live code. If you'd like to use bower, it's as easy as: bower install --save react And it's just as easy with npm: npm i --save react Contribute The main purpose of this repository is to continue to evolve React core, making it faster and easier to use. If you're interested in helping with that, then keep reading. If you're not interested in helping right now that's ok too. :) Any feedback you have about using React would be greatly appreciated. Building Your Copy of React The process to build react.js is built entirely on top of node.js, using many libraries you may already be familiar with. Prerequisites You have node installed at v4.0.0+ and npm at v2.0.0+. You have gcc installed or are comfortable installing a compiler if needed. Some of our npm dependencies may require a compliation step. On OS X, the Xcode Command Line Tools will cover this. On Ubuntu, apt-get install build-essential will install the required packages. Similar commands should work on other Linux distros. Windows will require some additional steps, see the node-gyp installation instructions for details. You are familiar with npm and know whether or not you need to use sudo when installing packages globally. You are familiar with git. Build Once you have the repository cloned, building a copy of react.js is really easy. # grunt-cli is needed by grunt; you might have this installed already npm install -g grunt-cli npm install grunt build At this point, you should now have a build/ directory populated with everything you need to use React. The examples should all work. Grunt We use grunt to automate many tasks. Run grunt -h to see a mostly complete listing. The important ones to know: # Build and run tests with PhantomJS grunt test # Lint the code with ESLint grunt lint # Wipe out build directory grunt clean Good First Bug To help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of good first bugs that contain bugs which are fairly easy to fix. This is a great place to get started. License React is BSD licensed. We also provide an additional patent grant. React documentation is Creative Commons licensed.

native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React. The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about - learn once, write anywhere. Facebook uses React Native in multiple production apps and will continue investing in React Native. Supported operating systems are >= Android 4.1 (API 16) and >= iOS 7.0. Getting Started Getting Help Documentation Examples Extending React Native Upgrading Opening Issues Contributing License Introduction See the official React Native website for an introduction to React Native. Getting Started Follow the Getting Started guide to install React Native and its dependencies. Check out this tutorial to walk through your first project that fetches real data and displays it in a list. Open the UIExplorer example project to see a list of components that ship with React Native. Install the React Developer Tools for Chrome or Firefox for better debugging (read more). Try out apps from the Showcase to see what React Native is capable of! Getting Help Please use these community resources for getting help. We use the GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests and have limited bandwidth to address them. Ask a question on StackOverflow and tag it with react-native Chat with us on Reactiflux in #react-native Articulate your feature request or upvote existing ones on Product Pains Start a thread on the React Discussion Board Join #reactnative on IRC: chat.freenode.net If it turns out that you may have found a bug, please open an issue Documentation The website’s documentation is divided into multiple sections. There are Guides that discuss topics like debugging, integrating with existing apps, and the gesture responder system. The Components section covers React components such as View and Navigator. The APIs section covers other libraries like Animated and StyleSheet that aren’t React components themselves. Finally, React Native provides a small number of Polyfills that offer web-like APIs. Another great way to learn more about the components and APIs included with React Native is to read their source. Look under the Libraries directory for components like ScrollView and Navigator, for example. The UIExplorer example is also here to demonstrate some of the ways to use these components. From the source you can get an accurate understanding of each component’s behavior and API. The React Native documentation only discusses the components, APIs and topics specific to React Native (React on iOS and Android). For further documentation on the React API that is shared between React Native and React DOM, refer to the React documentation. Examples git clone https://github.com/facebook/react-native.git cd react-native && npm install Running the examples on iOS Now open any example (the .xcodeproj file in each of the Examples subdirectories) and hit Run in Xcode. Running the examples on Android Note that you'll need the Android NDK installed, see prerequisites. ./gradlew :Examples:Movies:android:app:installDebug # Start the packager in a separate shell (make sure you ran npm install): ./packager/packager.sh # Open the Movies app in your emulator Extending React Native Looking for a component? JS.coach Fellow developers write and publish React Native modules to npm and open source them on GitHub. Making modules helps grow the React Native ecosystem and community. We recommend writing modules for your use cases and sharing them on npm. Read the guides on Native Modules (iOS, Android) and Native UI Components (iOS, Android) if you are interested in extending native functionality. Upgrading React Native is under active development. See the guide on upgrading React Native to keep your project up-to-date. Opening Issues If you encounter a bug with React Native we would like to hear about it. Search the existing issues and try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist before opening a new issue. It’s helpful if you include the version of React Native and OS you’re using. Please include a stack trace and reduced repro case when appropriate, too. The GitHub issues are intended for bug reports and feature requests. For help and questions with using React Native please make use of the resources listed in the Getting Help section. Product Pains in particular is a good way to signal your interest in a feature or issue. There are limited resources available for handling issues and by keeping the list of open issues lean we can respond in a timely manner. Contributing For more information about contributing PRs and issues, see our Contribution Guidelines. Good First Task is a great starting point for PRs. We encourage the community to ask and answer questions on Stack Overflow with the react-native tag. It's a great way to help out and be involved! License React is BSD licensed.

Virtual DOM Absolutely the smallest possible amount of DOM updates and reflows. One way data flow: updates and unmounts are propagated downwards from parent to children. Expressions are pre-compiled and cached for high performance. Lifecycle events for more control. Close to standards No proprietary event system. Event normalization. The rendered DOM can be freely manipulated with other tools. No extra HTML root elements or data- attributes. Plays well with jQuery.

Quick Start Generate your application using the Thorax Yeoman Generator Read about how Thorax works in the new Backbone Fundamentals Book. Install the Thorax Inspector Chrome extension. Building something smaller? Just link the core library as a single file from cdnjs compiled with all of its dependencies and use it anywhere or play with our Hello World fiddle or Todos fiddle. Features Hello World Thorax is used to build some of the biggest Backbone applications in the world but it's easy to get started. var view = new Thorax.View({   greeting: ""Hello"",   template: Handlebars.compile(""{{greeting}} world!"") }); view.appendTo('body');  Easy Data Binding By default every property of your view is automatically available in the template. If a model is bound its attributes will also be made available. var view = new Thorax.View({   greeting: 'Hello',   model: new Thorax.Model({     location: 'world!'   }),   template: ... });  Then in your template: {{greeting}} {{location}}  Context Control Don't like every property in your view being available in your template, or need to modify some model attributes? Just specify a context method to control what your template sees: var view = new Thorax.View({   model: new Thorax.Model({     greeting: 'hello'   }),   context: function() {     return {       greeting: this.model.get('greeting').toUpperCase()     };   },   template: ... });  Then in your template: {{greeting}}  Collection Rendering Easily render collections with the collection helper. Thorax will make sure that your view stays current as models in your collection are added, removed or updated. var view = new Thorax.View({   collection: new Thorax.Collection([{     title: 'Finish screencast',     done: true   }]),   template: ... });  Then in your template: {{#collection tag=""ul""}}   <li>     <input type=""checkbox"" {{#done}}checked{{/done}}     {{title}}   </li> {{else}}   <li>No todos yet.</li> {{/collection}}  jQuery and Zepto Integration Thorax extends the jQuery or Zepto $ object to allow you to get a reference to the nearest bound model, collection, or view. var view = new Thorax.View({   events: {     'change input[type=checkbox]': function(event) {       var model = $(event.target).model();       model.set({done: event.target.checked});     }   } });  Event Enhancements Thorax extends the events hash to let you listen to view events in addition to DOM events, and let's you pass a hash of model or collection events to listenTo when a model or collection is bound to your view. var view = new Thorax.View({   events: {     rendered: function() {}     model: {       change: function() {}     }   },   model: new Thorax.Model() });  Thorax also adds inheritable events to view classes, just call on on any class to listen for a DOM, view, model or collection event on any view. Thorax.View.on('eventName', handler);  Form Handling Easily capture entered form data with the serialize method which also provides event hooks for form validation. Models bound to the view will also automatically populate your forms. var view = new Thorax.View({   events: {     'submit form': function(event) {       event.preventDefault();       var attrs = this.serialize();       this.collection.add(attrs);     }   },   collection: new Thorax.Collection() });  Embeddable Views Easily embed one view within another with the view helper. var view = new Thorax.View({   child: new Thorax.View(...),   template: ... });  Then in your template: {{view child}}  Layouts and Lifecycle Thorax.LayoutView provides a container to place your views, and triggers lifecycle events on views placed within them. Layouts can be embedded in other views as well. var layout = new Thorax.LayoutView(); layout.appendTo('body'); var view = new Thorax.View({   events: {     ready: function() {},     destroyed: function() {}   } }) layout.setView(view);  Server Side Rendering Thorax allows for rendering outside of the normal browser context using environments such as Fruit Loops or PhantomJS to render content in the initial server response and then restore the view hierarchy on the client render. Rendering in such a manner allows for Thorax applications to expose their content for SEO purposes as well as speed up the perceived initial page load. The restore process is well suited for handling distinctions between user and public data, allowing for the server response to include only public, long cache-able, content. The client can then augment this data with any user specific data on restoration. Getting Started Tutorials/Examples Thorax Yeoman Generator Using the Thorax Generator, you can generate a Todos example application. You can also generate a blank application and build it out to match the Todos example app. This is a great way to learn by doing. Thorax in Backbone Fundamentals Read an overview of the features of Thorax, as well as some of the theory behind some of the implementation details. Route Based Module Loading Backbone Fundamentals also covers Lumbar's approach to modular application development and routing, which is used in all of the seed projects except the standalone and Rails seeds. Thorax Seed Thorax seed provides an example of a Lumber and Server-Side JavaScript project in action. This commit shows an example of converting an existing Thorax+Lumbar application to support SSJS. TodoMVC See the TodoMVC Thorax implementation and its source code. There is also a Lumbar flavored version of the implementation. kenwheeler has an example Parse-Todos implementation of Thorax combined with Parse. Examples mulderp/thorax-movies colinmegill/thorax-contacts-list-require-tutorial Resources Thorax Yeoman Generator The Thorax Generator will ask you questions before generating a new blank or predefined base project. This is the recommended way to get started. The Thorax Generator also provides it's own extensive documentation and aims to help you understand how to setup a full stack Thorax application, including a minimal node express server and deployment instructions. Bower component Thorax is available as a Bower component. Just run bower install thorax in your project. Thorax is tested against these dependencies (you can paste this in your bower.json: ""dependencies"": {   ""jquery"": ""1.9.0"",   ""underscore"": ""1.4.4"",   ""zepto"": ""1.0.0"",   ""handlebars"": ""1.0.0"",   ""backbone"": ""1.0.0"" }  Note that either jQuery or Zepto is required, but not both. cdnjs Thorax is available on cdnjs, each build includes jQuery 1.9.0 (or Zepto 1.0.0rc1 on mobile), Backbone 0.9.9, Underscore 1.4.2 and Handlebars 1.0.0rc6. Thorax Thorax (compressed) Thorax Mobile Thorax Mobile (compressed) Playground When combined with CoffeeScript small Thorax apps can be written in a single file. This is ideal for creating small test apps within JSFiddle. Thorax can be selected as a framework (near the bottom of the list) in any fiddle, or you can try out any of the fiddles below: Hello World Todos $ HelperView LayoutView & Lifecycle Embedding API Reference Registry Thorax creates a special hash for each type of class to store all subclasses in your application. The use of Thorax.Views and Handlebars.templates (usually defined by Handlebars) is required to allow the view, template and other helper methods to operate, but the use of Thorax.Models and Thorax.Collections are optional and provided for consistency. Class Registry Thorax.View Thorax.Views Thorax.Model Thorax.Models Thorax.Collection Thorax.Collections templates Handlebars.templates name klass.prototype.name If a name property is passed to any Thorax classes' extend method the resulting class will be automatically set in the corresponding registry. //set class Thorax.View.extend({   name: ""my-view"" });  //get class Thorax.Views[""my-view""]  templates Handlebars.templates A hash of templates, used by various Thorax helpers. If using the Lumbar or Rails boilerplate projects or the Thorax Generator this hash will be automatically generated from the files in your templates directories. To manually add a template to the hash: Handlebars.templates['my-template-name'] = Handlebars.compile('template string');  If a View has the same name as a template in the templates hash, its `template' property will be automatically assigned. Thorax.View Thorax.View provides additive functionality over Backbone.View but breaks compatibility in one important way in that it does not use an options object. All properties passed to the constructor become available on the instance: var view = new Thorax.View({   key: ""value"" }); view.key === ""value""  By default all instance properties are available in the template context. So when setting a key on the view it will by default be available in the template. template view.template Assign a template to a view. This may be a string or a function which receives a single context argument and returns a string. If the view has a name and a template of the same name is available the template will be auto-assigned. new Thorax.View({   template: Handlebars.compile(""{{key}}"") });  render view.render([content]) Renders the view's template updating the view's el with the result, triggering the rendered event. view.render();  render can also accept a content argument that may be an element, string or a template function: view.render('custom html');  restore view.restore(element, forceRerender) Attempts to restore a given view with the passed element. Should this fail the view will be rerendered automatically. Rerendering may be forced by setting the forceRerender parameter to truthy. See Server Rendering for further discussion. context view.context() Used by render to determine what attributes are available in the view's template. The default context function returns this + this.model.attributes if a model is present on the view. The context method may be overridden to provide a custom context: new Thorax.View({   template: Handlebars.compile('{{key}}'),   context: function() {     return _.defaults(this.model.attributes, {       key: 'value'     });   } });  appendTo view.appendTo(element) Appends the view to a given element which may be a CSS selector or DOM element. ensureRendered will be called and a ready event will be triggered. This is the preferred way to append your outer most view onto a page. renderTemplate view.renderTemplate(name [,context]) Renders a given template with the view's context or the given context argument. ensureRendered view.ensureRendered() Ensure that the view has been rendered at least once. conditionalRender view.conditionalRender([flag]) Renders the view if and only if shouldRender(flag) is true. Useful for ensuring that updates occur while still deferring final rendering until the view has been inserted into the DOM. When flag is undefined this is effectively the opposite behavior of ensureRendered. shouldRender view.shouldRender([flag]) Returns true if the view should be rendered based on flag and the current rendered state. flag may be: true : Always render false : Never render undefined : Render only if the view has been rendered previously html view.html([content]) Get or set the innerHTML of the view, without triggering the rendered event. _addChild view.addChild(child) Register a view as being a child of the parent. This will release the child view when the parent is released. this.childView = this._addChild(new ChildView);  If you are embedding a child view with the view helper this is automatically done for you. Use this when there are cases where the child would not be embedded, either due to the parent not rendering or the view helper being inside of a conditional. children view.children A hash of child view's indexed by cid. Child views may become attached to the parent with the view helper or may be automatically attached HelperView instances created by helpers created with registerViewHelper (such as the collection and empty helpers). parent view.parent If a view was embedded inside another with the view helper, or a generated HelperView (for instance the collection or empty helpers) it will have a parent view attribute. In the case of HelperViews, the parent will be the view that declared the helper in its template. retain view.retain([owner]) Prevents a view from being destroyed if it would otherwise be. If a parent is destroyed all its children will be destroyed, or if it was previously passed to setView Given the code below: a.retain(); Application.setView(a); Application.setView(b); Application.setView(c);  b will be destroyed, and a will not be. When the optional owner parameter is passed, the retain reference count will automatically be reduced when the owner view is destroyed. Views that have been retained must be released via release or they will leak. This is done automatically for views that are connected to an existing element via the el attribute. release view.release() Release a view that was previously retained. If release is called and the view has a reference count of zero it will be destroyed, which will release all children, remove all events, unbind all models and collections, call remove and trigger the destroyed event. release is usually called automatically if a view was attached to a LayoutView with the setView method, and another view is then passed to setView. Generally this method is not needed unless you are retaining views. setModel view.setModel(model [,options]) Setting model in the constructor will automatically call setModel, so the following are equivalent: var view = new Thorax.View({   model: myModel }); // identical functionality as above view.setModel(myModel);  Sets the model attribute of a view then attempts to fetch the model if it has not yet been populated. Once set the default context implementation will merge the model's attributes into the context, so any model attributes will automatically become available in a template. In addition any events declared via view.on({model: events}) will be bound to the model with listenTo. Accepts any of the following options: fetch - Boolean, whether to fetch the model when it is set, defaults to true. success - Callback on fetch success, defaults to noop render - Render on the view on model:change? Defaults to undefined true : Always render on change false : Never render on change undefined : Rerender if we have already been rendered populate - Call populate with the model's attributes when it is set? Defaults to true. Pass populate: {children: false} to prevent child views from having their inputs populated. Pass populate: {context: true} to populate using the view's context rather than directly populating from the model's attributes. errors - When the model triggers an error event, trigger the event on the view? Defaults to true setCollection view.setCollection(collection [,options]) Setting collection in the constructor will automatically call setCollection, so the following are equivalent: var view = new Thorax.View({   collection: myCollection }); // identical functionality as above view.setCollection(myCollection);  Sets the collection attribute of a view then attempts to fetch the collection if it has not yet been populated. In addition any events declared via view.on({collection: events}) will be bound to the collection with listenTo. Accepts any of the following options: render - Whether to render the collection if it is populated, or render it after it has been loaded. Defaults to undefined true : Always render on change false : Never render on change undefined : Rerender if we have already been rendered fetch - Whether or not to try to call fetch on the collection if shouldFetch returns true success - Callback on fetch success, defaults to noop errors - Whether or not to trigger an error event on the view when an error event is triggered on the collection change - Whether or not to call updateItem when a model's change event fires. Defaults to true. Note that while any view may bind a collection only a CollectionView will actually render a collection. A regular Thorax.View may declare a collection helper which in turn will generate and embed a CollectionView. serialize view.serialize([event], callback [,options]) Serializes a form. callback will receive the attributes from the form, followed by a release method which must be called before the form can be submitted again. callback will only be called if validateInput returns nothing or an empty array. options may contain: set - defaults to true, whether or not to set the attributes if valid on a model if one was set with setModel validate - defaults to true, whether or not to call validateInput during serialization children - defaults to true, whether or not to serialize inputs in child views silent - defaults to true, whether or not to pass silent: true to model.set Each form input in your application should contain a corresponding label. Since you may want to re-use the same form multiple times in the same view a @cid attribute with a unique value is provided to each render call of each template: <label for=""{{@cid}}-last-name""/> <input name=""last-name"" id=""{{@cid}}-last-name"" value=""Beastridge""/> <label for=""{{@cid}}-address[street]""/> <input name=""address[street]"" value=""123 Chestnut"" id=""{{@cid}}-address[street]""/>  new Thorax.View({   events: {     ""submit form"": function(event) {       this.serialize(event, function(attributes, release) {         attributes[""last-name""] === ""Beastridge"";         attributes.address.street === ""123 Chestnut"";         //form is locked to prevent duplicate submission         //until release is called         release();       });     }   } });  serialize Triggers the following events: serialize - called before validation with serialized attributes validate - with an attributes hash and errors array after validateInput is called invalid - with an errors array, if validateInput returned an array with any errors root - the root element to serialize within, defaults to this.$el If your view uses inputs with non standard names (or no names, multiple inputs with the same name, etc), use the serialize event: this.on('serialize', _.bind(function(attributes) {   attributes.custom = this.$('.my-input').val(); }, this));  populate view.populate([attributes] [,options]) Populate the form fields in the view with the given attributes. The keys of the attributes should correspond to the names of the inputs. populate is automatically called with the response from view.context() when setModel is called. By default this is just model.attributes. view.populate({   ""last-name"": ""Beastridge""   address: {     street: ""123 Chestnut""   } });  populate triggers a populate event. If your view uses inputs with non standard names (or no names, multiple inputs with the same name, etc), use this event: this.on('populate', _.bind(function(attributes) {   this.$('.my-input').val(attributes.custom); }, this));  To prevent child views from having their inputs populated use: view.populate(object, {   children: false });  validateInput view.validateInput(attributes) Validate the attributes created by serialize, must return an array or nothing (if valid). It's recommended that the array contain hashes with name and message attributes, but arbitrary data or objects may be passed. If the array has a zero length the attributes are considered to be valid. Returning an array with any errors will trigger the invalid event. validateInput: function(attributes) {   var errors = [];   if (attributes.password && !attributes.password.match(/.{6,11}/)) {     errors.push({name: 'password', message: 'Invalid Password'});   }   return errors; }  Thorax.HelperView registerViewHelper Handlebars.registerViewHelper(name [,viewClass] ,callback) Note that this differs from Handlebars.registerHelper. Registers a helper that will create and append a new HelperView instance, with its template attribute set to the value of the captured block. callback will receive any arguments passed to the helper followed by a HelperView instance. Named arguments to the helper will be present on options attribute of the HelperView instance. A HelperView instance differs from a regular view instance in that it has a parent attribute which is always set to the declaring view, and a context which always returns the value of the parent's context method. The collection, empty and other built in block view helpers are created with registerViewHelper. A helper that re-rendered a HelperView every time an event was triggered on the declaring view could be implemented as: Handlebars.registerViewHelper('on', function(eventName, helperView) {   helperView.listenTo(helperView.parent, eventName, function() {     helperView.render();   }); });  An example use of this would be to have a counter that would increment each time a button was clicked. In Handlebars: {{#on ""incremented""}}{{i}}{/on}} {{#button trigger=""incremented""}}Add{{/button}}  And the corresponding view class: new Thorax.View({   events: {     incremented: function() {       ++this.i;     }   },   initialize: function() {     this.i = 0;   },   template: ... });  In addition, if a view class is specified as the second argument to registerViewHelper, the helper will always initialize a view of that class instead of a HelperView: Handlebars.registerViewHelper('collection',   Thorax.CollectionHelperView, function(collection, view) {  });  Thorax.LayoutView A view to contain a single other view which will change over time, (multi-pane single page applications for instance), triggering a series of events . By default this class has no template. If one is specified use the layout-element helper to determine where setView will place a view. A Thorax.LayoutView is a subclass of Thorax.View and may be treated as a view in every regard (i.e. embed multiple LayoutView instances in a parent view with the view helper). setView view.setView(view [,options]) Set the current view on the LayoutView, triggering activated, ready and deactivated events on the current and previous view during the lifecycle. ensureRendered is called on views passed to setView. By default destroy is called on the previous view when the new view is set. To implement animations using setView pass a transition callback to setView which will receive the new view being set, the old view (if present), append, remove and complete functions which will execute the needed DOM and view operations. layout.setView(newView, {   transition: function(newView, oldView, append, remove, complete) {     append();     yourAnimation(function() {       remove();       complete();     });   } });  getView view.getView() Get the current view that was previously set with setView. Thorax.Model Enhances Backbone.Model with the concept of whether or not the model is populated and whether or not it should be automatically fetched. Note that when passing a model to view.setModel it must be an instance of Thorax.Model and not Backbone.Model. isEmpty model.isEmpty() Used by the empty helper. In a collection the implementations of isEmpty and isPopulated differ, but in a model isEmpty is an alias for !isPopulated. isPopulated model.isPopulated() Used by setModel to determine whether or not to fetch the model. The default implementation checks to see if any keys that are not id and are not default values have been set. Thorax.Collection Enhances Backbone.Collection with the concept of whether or not the collection is populated and whether or not it should be automatically fetched. Note that when passing a collection to view.setCollection it must be an instance of Thorax.Collection and not Backbone.Collection. isEmpty collection.isEmpty() Used by the empty helper and the emptyTemplate and emptyItem options of a CollectionView to check whether a collection is empty. A collection is only treated as empty if it isPopulated and zero length. isPopulated collection.isPopulated() Used by setCollection to determine whether or not to fetch the collection. Thorax.CollectionView A class that renders an itemTemplate or itemView for each item in a collection passed to it in its constructor, or via setCollection. The view will automatically update when items are added, removed or changed. The collection helper will automatically create and embed a CollectionView instance for you. If programmatic access to the view's methods are needed (for instance calling appendItem or specifying an itemFilter) it's best to create a CollectionView directly and embed it with the view helper as you would any other view. itemTemplate view.itemTemplate A template name or template function to use when rendering each model. If using the collection helper the passed block will become the itemTemplate. Defaults to view.name + '-item' itemView view.itemView A view class to be initialized for each item. Can be used in conjunction with itemTemplate. itemContext view.itemContext(model, index) A function in the declaring view to specify the context for an itemTemplate, receives model and index as arguments. itemContext will not be used if an itemView is specified as the itemView's own context method will instead be used. A collection helper may specify a specific function to use as the itemContext if there are multiple collections in a view: {{#collection todos item-context=""todosItemContext""}}  itemFilter view.itemFilter(model, index) A method, which if present will filter what items are rendered in a collection. Receives model and index and must return boolean. The filter will be applied when models' fire a change event, or models are added and removed from the collection. To force a collection to re-filter, call updateFilter on the view or collection view. Items are hidden and shown with $.hide and $.show rather than being removed or appended. In performance critical views with large collections consider filtering the collection before it is passed to the view or on the server. A collection helper may specify a specific function to use as the itemFilter if there are multiple collections in a view: {{#collection todos item-filter=""todosItemFilter""}}  updateFilter view.updateFilter() If using itemFilter, call this method to force the collection view to re-filter. emptyTemplate view.emptyTemplate A template name or template function to display when the collection is empty. If used in a collection helper the inverse block will become the emptyTemplate. Defaults to view.name + '-empty' emptyView view.emptyView A view class to create an instance of when the collection is empty. Can be used in conjunction with emptyTemplate. loadingTemplate view.loadingTemplate A template name or template function to display when the collection is loading. loadingView view.loadingView A view class to create an instance of when the collection is loading. Can be used in conjunction with loadingTemplate. loadingPlacement view.loadingPlacement() An index to place the loadingView or loadingTemplate at. Defaults to this.collection.length. appendItem view.appendItem(modelOrView [,index] [,options]) Append a model (which will used to generate a new itemView or render an itemTemplate) or a view at a given index in the CollectionView. If passing a view as the first argument index may be a model which will be used to look up the index. By default this will trigger a rendered:item event, silent: true may be passed in the options hash to prevent this. To also prevent the appended item from being filtered if an itemFilter is present pass filter: false in the options hash. removeItem view.removeItem(model) Remove an item from the view. updateItem view.updateItem(model) Equivalent to calling removeItem then appendItem. Note that this is mainly meant to cover edge cases, by default changing a model will update the needed item (whether using itemTemplate or itemView). Thorax.Util tag Thorax.Util.tag(name, htmlAttributes [,content] [,context]) Generate an HTML string. All built in HTML generation uses this method. If context is passed any Handlebars references inside of the htmlAttributes values will rendered with the context. Thorax.Util.tag(""div"", {   id: ""div-{{number}}"" }, ""content of the div"", {   number: 3 });  Thorax.ServerMarshal The ServerMarshal provides a mechanism for sharing data between server rendered content and the views that restore upon the HTML on the client. When dealing with simple primitives that may be serialized via JSON the values are stored directly in the server marshal store JSON object. For more complex objects such as models, collections, and views, a path relative to the handlebars rendering context is saved as a reference that can be resolved against the client-side equivalents. store Thorax.ServerMarshal.store($el, name, data, dataIds, options) Associates the given data with $el in the server marshal data store. May be restored on the client side via the Thorax.ServerMarshal.load API. $el the $ instance associated with the given element name the name of the data point to be saved data data to be stored. May be an array, object, or primitive value. Complex values must contain only primitive values or have proper associated dataIds element to allow for lookup on the client side. dataIds context paths associated with the data defined in data, if available. options options object. This object generally mirrors the options object passed to handlebars helpers, which may be passed directly. Fields may include: data current handlebars data object contextPath current context path for execution scope root current handlebars root rendering context view current view being rendered Data storage rules: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Nulls, and Objects with a toJSON implementation as all stringified When dataIds is a string value, the context path is stored for the data field When paired with a matching dataId structure, Arrays and objects are evaluated to one level deep. Primitive values fitting above are stringified All other objects are store the context path by combining options.data.contextPath and dataIds[key] Otherwise a server-marshal-object error is thrown The contextPath value is a data field tracked within Handlebars helpers. This is is the ""path"" from the root of the context that a particular handlebars lookup resolves to and is used to lookup the helper parameters at restore time. As a general rule if you are calling fn or inverse with a different context than you were called with then you will likely need to update the contextPath value. The appendContextPath helper is available for simple path updates:   data.contextPath = Handlebars.Utils.appendContextPath(data.contextPath, 'foo'); load Thorax.ServerMarshal.load(el, name, parentView, context) Returns the named server data for a given element. el element to load data for name data item name parentView the view instance that contains this particular element context the rendering context For complex objects, parentView and context will be used to lookup any context path objects saved from the server side. context values take priority over parentView values to match the behavior of the rendering pipeline. serialize Thorax.ServerMarshal.serialize() Retrieves the stringified representation of the marshal data set. Generally this does not need to be called explicitly as an onEmit handler will ensure that the data is output for the client exec. destory Thorax.ServerMarshal.destroy($el) Removes any marshal data that may be associated with a given element. $ $.view $(event.target).view([options]) Get a reference to the nearest parent view. Pass helper: false to options to exclude HelperViews from the lookup. Useful when registering DOM event handlers: $(event.target).view();  $.model $(event.target).model([view]) Get a reference to the nearest bound model. Can be used with any $ object but most useful in event handlers. $(event.target).model();  A view may be optionally passed to limit the lookup to a specific view. $.collection $(event.target).collection([view]) Get a reference to the nearest bound collection. Can be used with any $ object but most useful in event handlers. $(event.target).collection();  A view may be optionally passed to limit the lookup to a specific view. Event Enhancements Thorax adds inheritable class events for all Thorax classes and significant enhancements to the Thorax.View event handling. Inheritable Events ViewClass.on(eventName, callback) All Thorax classes have an on method to observe events on all instances of the class. Subclasses inherit their parents' event handlers. Accepts any arguments that can be passed to viewInstance.on or declared in the events hash. Thorax.View.on({   'click a': function(event) {    } });  Model Events When a model is bound to a view with setModel (automatically called by passing a model option in the constructor) any events on the model can be observed by the view in this way. For instance to observe any model change event when it is bound to any view: Thorax.View.on({   model: {     change: function() {       // ""this"" will refer to the view     }   } });  Collection Events When a collection is bound to a view with setCollection (automatically called by passing a collection option in the constructor) any events on the collection can be observed by the view in this way. For instance to observe any collection reset event when it is bound to any view: Thorax.View.on({   collection: {     reset: function() {       // ""this"" will refer to the view     }   } });  View Events view.events.viewEventName The events hash has been enhanced to allow view events to be registered along side DOM events: Thorax.View.extend({   events: {     'click a': function(event) {},     rendered: function() {}   } });  DOM Events view.on(eventNameAndSelector, callback [,context]) The on method will now accept event strings in the same format as the events hash, for instance click a. Events separated by a space will still be treated as registering multiple events so long as the event name does not start with a DOM event name (click, change, mousedown etc). DOM events observed in this way will only operate on the view itself. If the view embeds other views with the view helper that would match the event name and selector, they will be ignored. For instance declaring: view.on('click a', function(event) {})  Will only listen for clicks on a elements within the view. If the view has children that has a elements, this handler will not observe clicks on them. DOM events may be prefixed with the special keyword nested which will apply the event to all elements in child views: view.on('nested click a', function() {})  Thorax will add an attribute to the event named originalContext that will be the Element object that would have been set as this had the handler been registered with jQuery / Zepto: $('a').on('click', function() {}); view.on('click a', function(event) {   // event.originalContext === what ""this"" would be in the   // first handler });  When doing a server render, all DOM event handlers are silently discarded, as the majority do not make sense and environments such as Fruit Loops do not support. Code that relies on DOM events such as submit will need to take this into account. _addEvent view._addEvent(eventParams) This method is never called directly, but can be specified to override the behavior of the events hash or any event arguments passed to on. For each event declared in either manner _addEvent will be called with a hash containing: type ""view"" || ""DOM"" name (DOM events will begin with "".delegateEvents"") originalName selector (DOM events only) handler All of the behavior described in this section is implemented via this method, so if overriding make sure to call Thorax.View.prototype._addEvent in your child view. Data Loading Queuing Thorax wraps fetch (and therefore load) on models and collections with a queuing mechanism to ensure that multiple sync calls for the same url will not trigger multiple HTTP requests. To force a fetch or load call to create a new HTTP request regardless of whether an identical request is in the queue use the resetQueue option: model.fetch({   resetQueue: true   success: function() {} });  bindToRoute Thorax.Util.bindToRoute(callback [,failback]) Used by model.load and collection.load. Binds the callback to the current route. If the browser navigtates to another route in the time between when the callback is bound and when it is executed, callback will not be called. Else failback will be called if present. routerMethod: function() {   var callback = Thorax.Util.bindToRoute(function() {     //callback called if browser is still on route   });   setTimeout(callback, 5000); }  load modelOrCollection.load(callback [,failback] [,options]) Calls fetch on the model or collection ensuring the callbacks will only be called if the route does not change. callback and failback will be used as arguments to bindToRoute. options will be passed to the fetch call on the model or collection if present. routerMethod: function(id) {   var view = new Thorax.View();   var model = new Application.Model({id: id});   model.load(function() {     //callback only called if browser still on this route     view.setModel(model);     myLayoutView.setView(view);   }, function() {     //failback only called if browser has left this route   }); }  Triggers load:start and load:end events on the model or collection, and additionally on a view if it has bound the object via setModel or setCollection. By default the events will propagate to a root object set with setRootObject. Pass background: true as an option to prevent the event from being triggered on the rootObject. setRootObject Thorax.setRootObject(obj) Set the root object that will receive load:start and load:end events if the load:start was not a background event. This is useful to implement a global loading indicator. loadHandler Thorax.loadHandler(startCallback, endCallback) Generates an load:start event handler that when triggered will then monitor the associated object for a load:end event. If the duration between the start and the end events exceed _loadingTimeoutDuration then the start and end callbacks will be triggered at the appropriate times to allow the display of a loading UI. view.on(""load:start"", Thorax.loadHandler(   function(message, background, object) {     view.$el.addClass(""loading"");   },   function(background, object) {     view.$el.removeClass(""loading"");   }));  _loadingClassName view._loadingClassName Class name to add and remove from a view's el when it is loading. Defaults to loading. _loadingTimeoutDuration view._loadingTimeoutDuration Timeout duration in seconds before a load:start callback will be triggered. Defaults to 0.33 seconds. If for instance the load:end event was triggered 0.32 seconds after the load:start event the load:start callback would not be called. _loadingTimeoutEndDuration view._loadingTimeoutEndDuration Just like _loadingTimeoutDuration but applies to load:end. Defaults to 0.10 seconds. Template Helpers template {{template name [options]}} Embed a template inside of another, as a string. An associated view (if any) will not be initialized. By default the template will be called with the current context but extra options may be passed which will be added to the context. {{template ""path/to/template"" key=""value""}}  If a block is used, the template will have a variable named @yield available that will contain the contents of the block. {{#template ""child""}}   content in the block will be available in a variable   named ""@yield"" inside the template ""child"" {{/template}}  This is useful when a child template will be called from multiple different parents. super {{super}} Embed the template from the parent view within the child template. {{super}}  view {{view name [options]}} Embed one view in another. The first argument may be the name of a new view to initialize or a reference to a view that has already been initialized. {{view ""path/to/view"" key=""value""}} {{view viewInstance}}  If a block is specified it will be assigned as the template to the view instance: {{#view viewInstance}}   viewInstance will have this block   set as its template property {{/view}}  element {{element name [options]}} Embed a DOM element in the view. This uses a placeholder technique to work, if the placeholder must be of a certain type in order to be valid (for instance a tbody inside of a table) specify a tag option. {{element domElement tag=""tbody""}}  button {{#button methodName [htmlAttributes...]}} Creates a button tag that will call the specified methodName on the view when clicked. Arbitrary HTML attributes can also be specified. {{#button ""methodName"" class=""btn""}}Click Me{{/button}}  The tag name may also be specified: {{#button ""methodName"" tag=""a"" class=""btn""}}A Link{{/button}}  A trigger attribute will trigger an event on the declaring view: {{#button trigger=""eventName""}}Button{{/button}}  A button can have both a trigger attribute and a method to call: {{#button ""methodName"" trigger=""eventName""}}Button{{/button}}  The method may also be specified as a method attribute: {{#button method=""methodName""}}Button{{/button}}  url {{url urlString expand-tokens=bool}} Prepends ""#"" if Backbone.history.pushSate is disabled or prepends Backbone.history.root if it is enabled. If expand-tokens=true is passed, then any handlebars tokens will be resolved with the current context. For example if the context had an id attribute {{id}} would be replaced with the value of id: {{url ""articles/{{id}}"" expand-tokens=true}}  Multiple arguments can be passed and will be joined with a ""/"": {{url ""articles"" id}}  link {{#link url [htmlAttributes...]}} Creates an a tag that will call Backbone.history.navigate() with the given url when clicked. Passes the url parameter to the url helper with the current context. Do not use this method for creating external links. Like the url helper, multiple arguments may be passed as well as an expand-tokens option. {{#link ""articles/{{id}}"" expand-tokens=true class=""article-link""}}Link Text{{/link}}  To call a method from an a tag use the button helper: {{#button ""methodName"" tag=""a""}}My Link{{/button}}  Like the button helper, a trigger attribute may be specified that will trigger an event on the declaring view in addition to navigating to the specified url: {{#link ""articles"" id trigger=""customEvent""}}Link Text{{/link}}  The href attribute is required but may also be specified as an attribute: {{#link href=""articles/{{id}}"" expand-tokens=true}}Link Test{{/link}}  collection {{collection [collection] [options...]}} Creates and embeds a CollectionView instance, updating when items are added, removed or changed in the collection. If a block is passed it will be used as the item-template, which will be called with a context of the model.attributes for each model in the collection. {{#collection tag=""ul""}}   <li>{{modelAttr}}</li> {{/collection}}  Options may contain tag, class, id and the following attributes which will map to the generated CollectionView instance: item-template → itemTemplate item-view → itemView empty-template → emptyTemplate empty-view → emptyView loading-template → loadingTemplate loading-view → loadingView item-context → itemContext item-filter → itemFilter Any of the options can be specified as variables in addition to strings: {{collection item-view=itemViewClass}}  By default the collection helper will look for this.collection, but if your view contains multiple collections a collection argument may be passed: {{collection myCollection}}  When rendering this.collection many properties will be forwarded from the view that is declaring the collection helper to the generated CollectionView instance: itemTemplate itemView itemContext itemFilter emptyTemplate emptyView loadingTemplate loadingView loadingPlacement As a result the following two views are equivalent: // render with collection helper, collection // properties are forwarded var view = new Thorax.View({   collection: new Thorax.Collection(),   itemView: MyItemClass,   itemContext: function(model, i) {     return model.attributes;   },   template: Handlebars.compile('{{collection}}') });  // directly create collection view, no property // forwarding will occur var view = new Thorax.View({   collectionView: new Thorax.CollectionView({     collection: new Thorax.Collection(),     itemView: MyItemClass     itemContext: function(model, i) {       return model.attributes;     }   }),   template: Handlebars.compile('{{view collectionView}}') });  empty {{#empty [modelOrCollection]}} A conditional helper much like if that calls isEmpty on the specified object. In addition it will bind events to re-render the view should the object's state change from empty to not empty, or vice versa. {{#empty collection}}   So empty! {{else}}   {{#collection}}{{/collection}} {{/empty}}  To embed a row within a collection helper if it the collection is empty, specify an empty-view or empty-template. Or use the else block of the collection helper: {{#collection tag=""ul""}}   <li>Some very fine data</li> {{else}}   <li>So very empty</li> {{/collection}}  collection-element {{collection-element [htmlAttributes...]}} By default Thorax.CollectionView instances have no template. Items will be appended to and removed from the view's el. Alternatively a template can be specified and collection-element used to specify where the individual items in a collection will be rendered. <div>   {{collection-element tag=""ul"" class=""my-list""}} </div>  layout-element {{layout-element [htmlAttributes...]}} By default Thorax.LayoutView instances have no template, setView will append directly to the view's el. Alternatively a template can be specified and a layout-element and setView will append to that element. <ul>   {{layout-element tag=""li"" id=""my-layout""}} </ul>  loading {{#loading}} A block helper to use when the view is loading. For collection specific loading the CollectionView accepts loadingView and loadingTemplate options to append an item in a collection when it is loading. {{#loading}}   View is loading a model or collection. {{else}}   View is not loading a model or collection. {{/loading}}  Catalog of Built-in Events rendered rendered () Triggered on a view when the rendered method is called. child child (instance) Triggered on a view every time a child view is appended into the view with the view helper. ready ready (options) Triggered when a view is appended to the DOM with appendTo or when a view is appended to a LayoutView via setView. Setting focus and other behaviors that depend on the view being present in the DOM should be handled in this event. This event propagates to all children, including children that will be bound after the view is created. options will contain a target view, which is the view that triggered the event. activated activated (options) Triggered on a view immediately after it was passed to a LayoutView's setView method. Like ready this event propagates to children and the options hash will contain a target view. deactivated deactivated (options) Triggered on a view when it was previously passed to the setView method on a LayoutView, and then another view is passed to setView. Triggered when the current view's el is still attached to the parent. Like ready this event propagates to children and the options hash will contain a target view. destroyed destroyed () Triggered on a view when the release method is called and the reference count is zero. Useful for implementing custom view cleanup behaviors. release will be also be called if it was previously passed to the setView method on a LayoutView, and then another view is passed to setView. change:view:start change:view:start (newView [,oldView] ,options) Trigged on a Thorax.LayoutView immediately after setView is called. change:view:end change:view:end (newView [,oldView] ,options) Trigged on a Thorax.LayoutView after setView is called, the old view has been destroyed (if present) and the new view has been attached to the DOM and had its ready event triggered. helper helper (name [,args...] ,helperView) Triggered on a view when a view helper (such as collection, empty, etc) create a new HelperView instance. helper:name helper:name ([,args...] ,helperView) Triggered on a view when a given view helper creates a new HelperView instance. {{#collection cats}}{{/collection}}  view.on('helper:collection', function(collection, collectionView) {  });  serialize serialize (attributes) Triggered on a view when serialize is called, before validateInput is called with the serialized attributes. validate validate (attributes, errors) Triggered on a view when serialize is called, passed an attributes hash and errors array after validateInput is called. Use in combination with the invalid event to display and clear errors from your views. Thorax.View.on({   validate: function(attributes, errors) {     //clear previous errors if present   },   invalid: function(errors) {     errors.forEach(function(error) {       //lookup input by error.name       //display error from error.message     });   } });  invalid invalid (errors) Triggered on a view when serialize is called, if validateInput returned an array with any errors. populate populate (attributes) Triggered on a view when populate is called. Passed a hash containing the attributes that the view will be populated with. load:start load:start (message, background, target) Triggered on a model or collection by fetch or load and on a view if it has bound the model or collection with setModel or setCollection. Always generate a handler for a load:start event with Thorax.loadHandler. load:end load:end (target) Triggered on a model or collection by fetch or load and on a view if it has bound the model or collection with setModel or setCollection. Never observe this directly, always use Thorax.loadHandler on load:start. rendered:collection rendred:collection (collectionView, collection) Triggered on a CollectionView or the view calling the collection helper every time render is called on the CollectionView. rendered:item rendered:item (collectionView, collection, model, itemElement, index) Triggered on a CollectionView or the view calling the collection helper every time an item is rendered in the CollectionView. rendered:empty rendered:empty (collectionView, collection) Triggered on a CollectionView or the view calling the collection helper every time the emptyView or emptyTemplate is rendered in the CollectionView. restore restore(forceRerender) Triggered when the view is being restored to the current element. Listeners should be aware that it's possible for a rerender to occur while the restore event has triggered and should be able to handle this case gracefully. after-restore may provide a better option for cases that need to apply DOM changes after any potential render operations. If the current restore process will force a rerender then the forceRerender parameter will be truthy. after-restore after-restore() Triggered when the view has been restored and possibly rerendered to the current element. If the current restore process will force a rerender then the forceRerender parameter will be truthy. restore:collection restore:collection(collectionView, el) Triggered on a CollectionView or a view calling the collection helper when the collection is restored. restore:item restore:item(collectionView, el) Triggered on a CollectionView or a view calling the collection helper upon restoring an individual item element in the collection. restore:empty restore:empty(collectionView, el) Triggered on a CollectionView or a view calling the collection helper when a restore operation includes an empty view or template. restore:fail restore:fail(info) Triggered when a particular view can not be restored. info may be a free form object but generally it will have a type field, outlined below, and a view field listing the view instance that failed. Types: previously-rendered: View has been rendered already remaining: View has children that were not restored and must do a partial rerender not-restorable: View was explicitly marked as not restorable serialize: Unable to marshal one or more of the parameters passed to the helper collection-remove: Item removed due to not being found in client-side collection collection-missing: Item rendered due to not existing in server-side collection collection-depthed-query: Attempted to use an inline collection item or empty template with ../ references. HTML Attributes Thorax and its view helpers generate a number of custom HTML attributes that may be useful in debugging or generating CSS selectors to be used as arguments to $ or to create CSS. The *-cid attributes are generally used only internally. See $.model, $.collection and $.view to get a reference to objects directly from the DOM. The *-name attributes will only be present if the given objects have a name property. Attribute Name Attached To `data-view-cid` Every view instances' `el` `data-view-name` Same as above, only present on named views `data-collection-cid` Element generated by the `collection helper` `data-collection-name` Same as above, only present when the bound collection is named `data-collection-empty` Set to ""true"" or ""false"" depending on whether the bound collection `isEmpty` `data-collection-element` Set by the `collection-element`, determines where a collection in a `CollectionView` will be rendered. `data-view-empty` Collection view's empty element `data-model-cid` A view's `el` if a model was bound to the view or each item element inside of elements generated by the collection helper `data-model-id` A view's `el` if a model was bound to the view or each item element inside of elements generated by the collection helper `data-model-name` Same as above, only present if the model is named `data-layout-cid` The element generated by the `layout` helper or `el` inside of a `LayoutView` or `ViewController` instance `data-view-helper` Elements generated by various helpers including `collection` and `empty` from the collection plugin `data-call-method` Elements generated by the `link` and `button` helpers `data-trigger-event` Elements generated by the `link` and `button` helpers `data-view-restore` View elements rendered on the server side. `true` signifies that restoring is possible. `false` that it's explicitly disallowed. `data-view-helper-restore` Helper View elements rendered on the server side. Provides the name of the helper view. `data-server-data` Elements with `ServerMarshal` data associated with them. When creating CSS selectors it's recommended to use the generated attributes (especially data-view-name) rather than assigning custom IDs or class names for the sole purpose of styling. [data-view-name=""my-view-name""] {   border: 1px solid #ddd; }  Error Handling Certain critical code paths are executed using the bindSection and runSection APIs. Should code executed on these paths throw, additional information regarding the code location, etc may be logged and used for debugging. Override these APIs with your own logging / debugging handler or utilize Costanza for an enhanced error tracking. onException Thorax.onException(name, error, info) Logs exceptions when they occur. Passed to the function are a unique identifier, name, the thrown exception, error, and an object containing any additional information, info. The default implementation is null instead of a function which makes Thorax not intervene with the exception process at all. The typical use case for this method is if you use an error reporting service, such as Costanza, or in this example, Raven.js: Throax.onException = function(name, error) {   Raven.captureException(error); };  bindSection Thorax.bindSection(name, info, callback) Wraps a callback in an error wrapper. Included with the callback is an identifying name value and any relevant information, info that may help debugging the exception. By default this calls Thorax.onException if it has been defined and an exception is thrown. Implementors may override this method to provide additional error handling before exceptions occur. runSection Thorax.runSection(name, info, callback) Immediately executed version of bindSection. The default implementation delegates to bindSection. Server Rendering Server side rendering is designed around Fruit Loops, but may be performed in any environment that supports the $ API as well as a few core APIs used to control the page life cycle. $serverSide Boolean flag set to true when rendering server side content. FruitLoops.emit() Called when the page should be sent back to the client. FruitLoops.onEmit(calback) Registers a callback which will be called just prior to the emit operation. Restore Process The restore process involves walking the DOM hierarchy looking for nodes that are annotated with the data-view-restore attribute. When such a node is found Thorax will attempt to restore based on a variety of steps discussed in the Restore Methods section below. This process is kicked off by either an explicit call to View.restore or by calling LayoutView.setView on a previously restored layout view. The application restore process might look something like: var appEl = $('[data-view-name=""application""]'); if (appEl.length) {   // Restore the application view explicitly   Application.restore(appEl); } else {   $('body').append(Application.el);   Application.render(); }  Followed by normal controller execution, ultimately culminating in setView call, which will restore the rendered child. Restore Methods There is no definitive algorithm for restoring views, instead the following heuristics are used. In the event of a mismatch the restore:fail event will be emitted on the candidate view with additional debugging information regarding what portion of the heuristic failed. General Rules If the candidate view instance has already been rendered then the previous element will be replaced with the existing view element. This case is tracked by restore:fail with a type field of prev-render. By default restore operations are depth first recursive. This allows for restore operations to partially rerender content for the minimal number of rerender operations. Any view that is explicitly marked with data-view-restore=false will be rerendered on the client. This shortcircuits the tree traversal and causes all children to be rerendered as well. setView calls When setView is called an attempt will be made to restore the view to the layout view's child element if marked for restore. This assumes that the view is a named view. Should it not be a rerender will occur. Helper Views Elements rendered via a helper view such as view or collection will automatically be restored. This is done by saving the parameters passed to the helper view into the server marshal store. On restore the helper view will be executed in a similar manner to the initial execution, with the distinction that the restore method will be called after the view has initialized. When using helper views the restore might be forced to rerender if utilizing helpers that do no properly set the contextPath or if passed a depthed parameter, i.e. {{view ../foo}} as these can not be safely resolved. This is tracked via the restore:fail event with type serialize and is determined on the server-side. Additionally helpers that utilize subexpressions to resolve complex values are unable to be restored via path lookup and will force a rerender. Collection Views Collection views follow the same restore rules as helper views but add the ability to restore nested child views. Rerender cases (additional to the helper cases): Use of a block helper that has a ../ reference:   {{#collection}}{{../foo}}{{/collection}} Use of collections that do not have an id value. Note that overriding renderItem is allowed but discouraged as this has additional overhead vs. providing an itemView or itemTemplate value. This also applies to renderEmpty. Best Practices In general there are a number of things that help avoid rerender cases. Logging While in development mode tracking the number of times that a rerender case is triggered is vital for ensuring that the restore behavior is actually benefiting the site. This might be as simple as a global logger on the restore:fail event: View.on('restore:fail', function(info) {   console.log('restore:fail', info); }); Custom Restore Logic It's recommended that views needing custom restore behavior do so by providing a restore event listener rather than overriding the restore method. This is due to the manner in which partial restores are implemented, delegating to the super class implementation may cause a rerender meaning any non-restored children are rerendered as well. Should a view absolutely need to prevent the default restore behavior it can override the restore method but it must manually remove the data-view-restore attribute and also perform any child traversal necessary. For most situations it should not be necessary to provide a custom restore implementation but cases that implement custom view insertion logic, i.e. calling DOM methods to insert the child view, will likely need to provide some level of custom restore logic. Ex:   CustomView.on('restore', function() {     var child = this.$('.child-view');     if (child.length) {       this.childView.restore(child);     }   }); Data Loading Since pending fetch operations might rerender the content of a just restored view, it's recommended that the JSON content is cached in a manner that is accessible on the initial page load to avoid unnecessary rendering operations after restore. Fruit Loops offers such a system via the $serverCache local variable. Should this not be possible, the thorax rendering pipeline will handle any the restore and subsequent rerender properly. Note that there are issues that might arise if a different model data source is used on the client vs. the server, a personalized vs public data source for example. When such data is loaded prior to the restore operation, it might be necessary to provide a custom restore step that checks if this data has changed and rerender as there is no clean way for Thorax to determine if a model's data has changed between the two states. Error Codes button-trigger button helper must have a method name as the first argument or a 'trigger', or a 'method' attribute specified. link-href link helper requires an href as the first argument or an href attribute. collection-element-helper collection-element helper must be declared inside of a CollectionView super-parent Cannot use super helper when parent has no name or template. view-helper-hash-args Hash arguments are not allowed in the view helper as templates should not introduce side effects to view instances. layout-element-helper layout-element helper must be used within a LayoutView. mixed-fetch Both set and reset were passed to fetch, must use one or the other. nested-render render was called which triggered an event handler which in turn called render. Infinite recursion was halted. handlebars-no-data Handlebars template compiled without data, use: Handlebars.compile(template, {data: true}) insert-destroyed A helper view that has been destroyed was inserted into the view. void-tag-content A void tag such as img was rendered with content in Thorax.Util.tag. server-marshal-object A complex object was serialized without a proper context path to lookup the object on the client side. See Thorax.ServerMarshal for more discussion on context paths. fn-view-unregistered $.view found a view element that was inserted manually into the DOM and was not registered with _addChild or retain. Call parent._addChild(view) or view.retain() on view insertion or instantiation. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

All information, commercial support contacts and examples are available at chaplinjs.org, comprehensive documentation and class reference can be found at docs.chaplinjs.org. Download the latest release on chaplinjs.org. See below on how to compile from source manually. Building Chaplin The Chaplin source files are originally written in the CoffeeScript meta-language. However, the Chaplin library file is a compiled JavaScript file which defines the chaplin module. Our build script compiles the CoffeeScripts and bundles them into one file. To run the script, follow these steps: Download and install Node.js. Open a shell (aka terminal aka command prompt) and type in the commands in the following steps. Change into the Chaplin root directory. Install all dependencies npm install  Start the build npm run build install  This creates these files in build dir: chaplin.js – The library as a compiled JavaScript file. chaplin.min.js – Minified. For production use you should pick this. Running the Tests Chaplin aims to be fully unit-tested. At the moment most of the modules are covered by Mocha tests. How to run the tests: Follow the steps for building chaplin. Open a shell (aka terminal aka command prompt) and type in the commands in the following steps. Change into the Chaplin root directory. Start the test runner. npm test  or alternatively, if you want code coverage reports    npm run coverage  Generated code coverage reports may be viewed by opening coverage/index.html in your browser.

It is a collection of common design and implementation patterns found in applications. Documentation All of the documentation for Marionette can be found at marionettejs.com/docs/current App Architecture On Backbone's Building Blocks Backbone provides a great set of building blocks for our JavaScript applications. It gives us the core constructs that are needed to build small apps, organize jQuery DOM events, or create single page apps that support mobile devices and large scale enterprise needs. But Backbone is not a complete framework. It's a set of building blocks. It leaves much of the application design, architecture and scalability to the developer, including memory management, view management, and more. Marionette brings an application architecture to Backbone, along with built in view management and memory management. It's designed to be a lightweight and flexible library of tools that sits on top of Backbone, providing the framework for building a scalable application. Like Backbone itself, you're not required to use all of Marionette just because you want to use some of it. You can pick and choose which features you want to use. This allows you to work with other Backbone frameworks and plugins easily. It also means that you are not required to engage in an all-or-nothing migration to begin using Marionette. Chat with us Find us on gitter or on IRC in the FreeNode.net #marionette channel. We're happy to discuss design patterns and learn how you're using Marionette. Key Benefits Scalable: applications built in modules with event-driven architecture Sensible defaults: Underscore templates are used for view rendering Easily modifiable: works with the specific needs of your application Reduce boilerplate: for all views, including specialized types Create: application visuals at runtime with Region and LayoutView objects Nested: views and layouts within visual regions Built-in: memory management and zombie-killing for views, layoutViews and regions Event-driven architecture: utilizing the Backbone.Wreqr.EventAggregator Flexible: ""as-needed"" architecture allowing you to pick and choose what you need And much, much more Marionette Inspector Visualize the view hierarchy with the UI tree Visualize application activity with a full history of actions Inspect view ui, events, listeners, properties Inspect model attributes, listeners, properties Explore Radio channel events, requests, commands Explore application with an inspector magnifying glass Jump between the inspector elements and source panel with intelligent links Download at Chrome Web Store Explore code at Github Source Code and Downloads You can download the latest builds directly from the ""lib"" folder above. For more information about the files in this folder, or to obtain an archive containing all Marionette dependencies (including Underscore, Backbone, etc.), please visit the downloads section on the website. MarionetteJS.com Available Packages Marionette is available via bower, npm, and component.io. There are other channels that are maintained by the community. Release Notes And Upgrade Guide Changelog: For change logs and release notes, see the changelog file. Upgrade Guide: Be sure to read the upgrade guide for information on upgrading to the latest version of Marionette. Annotated Source Code The source code for Marionette is heavily documented. You can read the annotations for all the details of how Marionette works and advice on which methods to override. View the annotated source code Compatibility and Requirements MarionetteJS currently works with the following libraries: jQuery v1.8+ Underscore v1.4.4 - 1.8.3 Backbone v1.0.0 - 1.2.1 are preferred. Backbone.Wreqr Comes automatically with the bundled build. Backbone.BabySitter Comes automatically with the bundled build. Marionette has not been tested against any other versions of these libraries. You may or may not have success if you use a version other than what is listed here.

It aims to have a similar API to Reactive, but allow composition of views, like React. The major difference for other view libraries is that there are no globals used at all. Each view has its own set of bindings and plugins. This makes composition of views really easy. var Person = ripple('<div>{{name}}</div>')   .attr('name', { required: true, type: 'string' });  var person = new Person({   name: 'Tom' });  person.appendTo(document.body); person.name = ""Barry""; // DOM updates automatically Install component install ripplejs/ripple Browser Support Supports real browsers and IE9+. Documentation Documentation is on the wiki. Examples Clock Counter Like Button Markdown Editor Iteration See more examples at ripplejs/examples Plugins shortcuts - add custom key binding combos events - add event listeners to the DOM and call methods on the view each - Basic iteration using the each directive. bind-methods - Bind all methods on the prototype to the view markdown - Adds a directive to render markdown using Marked. extend - Makes adding methods to the view prototype a little cleaner intervals - Easily add and remove intervals computed - Add computed properties. refs - Easily reference elements within the template dispatch - Dispatch custom DOM events up the tree View and add them on the wiki License MIT Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Learn by reading the Guide and refer to the Binder Reference to see what binders are available to you out-of-the-box. Building and Testing First install any development dependencies. $ npm install  Building Rivets.js uses gulp as its build tool. Run the following task to compile + minify the source into dist/. $ gulp build  Testing Rivets.js uses mocha as its testing framework, alongside should for expectations and sinon for spies, stubs and mocks. Run the following to run the full test suite. $ npm test  Contributing Bug Reporting Ensure the bug can be reproduced on the latest master. Open an issue on GitHub and include an isolated JSFiddle demonstration of the bug. The more information you provide, the easier it will be to validate and fix. Pull Requests Fork the repository and create a topic branch. Make sure not to commit any changes under dist/ as they will surely cause conflicts for others later. Files under dist/ are only committed when a new build is released. Include tests that cover any changes or additions that you've made. Push your topic branch to your fork and submit a pull request. Include details about the changes as well as a reference to related issue(s). Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Derby includes a powerful data synchronization engine called Racer that automatically syncs data among browsers, servers, and a database. Models subscribe to changes on specific objects, enabling granular control of data propagation without defining channels. Racer supports offline usage and conflict resolution out of the box, which greatly simplifies writing multi-user applications. Derby applications load immediately and can be indexed by search engines, because the same templates render on both server and client. In addition, templates define bindings, which instantly update the view when the model changes and vice versa. Derby makes it simple to write applications that load as fast as a search engine, are as interactive as a document editor, and work offline. See docs here: http://derbyjs.com/ Examples here: https://github.com/derbyjs/derby-examples Major updates coming soon! 0.6 was a complete rewrite that funadamentally changed a lot of things internally. 0.6 increases performance, reduces memory leaks, and improves stability. The docs are still being updated. There have been many API changes, but they are straightforward for current Derby apps. Most of the changes are simplifications that will clean up awkward limitiations of the previous version.

With no to little JS code to write. And no dependencies. Demo Codepen jsFiddle Buy us coffee: Gittip Follow us on Twitter: @way_js Quick start Declare an HTML element with some tags.   <form way-data=""myFormData"" way-persistent=""true"">     <input type=""text"" name=""name"">     <input type=""text"" name=""age"">     <input type=""text"" name=""gender"">   </form>    Name: <span way-data=""myFormData.name""></span>  Boom. Now every change in the form will be stored in-memory. The bound span's html will be changed on the fly. And the bound data will be persistent, meaning your HTML will be populated with your data on page reloads. Enough talk, see it in action. Installation [Step 1] Include the library to your page. <script src=""way.min.js""></script> [Step 2] There is no step 2. You are good to go. Options Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to way-, as in way-data="""". Set these options to the elements that have to be bound. Name Type Default Description data string null Allows to define the dot separated path where the data will be stored. Can include arrays. When used on a form, a json variable made of all the included inputs with a [name] attribute will be created and stored in the specified storage. Pass the ""__all__"" path to access all way.js' data. default string null A link to a default data to set on an element, in case there is no bound value. persistent boolean true Allows to store the data to localStorage everytime the bound data changes. readonly boolean false Prevents the element changes from resetting the bound value. writeonly Boolean false Prevents the element from getting changed when the bound value changes. json boolean false Returns pretty-printed json data to its DOM element. html boolean false Declares whether the data attributed to an element should be parsed as HTML or not. pick array null A comma separated list of values to pick (in forms only) to sync with the storage. By default, all form inputs are synced. omit array null A comma separated list of values (in forms only) to not sync with the storage. By default, no form input is omitted. Some examples: <form way-data=""some.form"" way-pick=""some,properties,that,can.be.nested""> <form way-data=""some.form"" way-omit=""dont,want.those""> <img way-data=""some.image"" way-default=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a6/Bender_Rodriguez.png""> <pre way-data=""some.json"" way-json=""true""></pre> Scopes You can set scopes to your DOM elements' data. [way-scope] attribute Passing this attribute to an element will point all its children's ""way-data"" attributes to this scope. Scopes can be nested. way.set(""someScope"", { with: { something: ""hello"" }}) <div way-scope=""someScope"">   <div way-scope=""with"">     <div way-data=""something""></div> <!-- Will render ""hello"" -->   </div> </div> [way-scope-break] attribute Breaks a scope chain. All the child elements of this one will have no scope set. way.set(""someScope"", { with: { something: ""hello"" }}) <div way-scope=""someScope"">   <div way-scope-break=""true"">     <div way-data=""someScope.with.something""></div> <!-- Will render ""hello"" -->   </div> </div> scope() method Returns the scope of a given DOM element <div way-scope=""someScope"">   <div way-scope=""with"">     <div way-data=""something"" id=""someDIV""></div>   </div> </div> way.dom(""#someDIV"").scope()   >> ""someScope.with"" Repeats Duplicates a DOM element for each of the values it can loop through in a way.js' passed data. Notes: Repeat blocks automatically set the appropriate scope to their child elements. On each loop, ""$$key"" corresponds to the key of the current element looped. Having this: way.set(""some.list"", [     {name:""Pierre""},     {name:""Paul""},     {name:""Jacques""} ]); <div way-repeat=""some.list"">     $$key - <span way-data=""name""></span> </div> Will render that: <div way-scope=""some.list"">   <div way-scope=""0"">     0 - <span way-data=""name"">Pierre</span>   </div>   <div way-scope=""1"">     1 - <span way-data=""name"">Paul</span>   </div>   <div way-scope=""2"">     2 - <span way-data=""name"">Jacques</span>   </div> </div> Transforms Transforms the displayed data bound to your DOM elements. [way-transform] attribute Pass transform functions by name. Add multiple transforms by separating them with the ""|"" symbol. In case of conflicts between transforms, the last mentionned transform wins. Some pre-build transforms [PR welcome for more!] Name Description Example uppercase Sets a string to uppercase ""hello"" becomes ""HELLO"" lowercase Sets a string to lowercase ""HELLO"" becomes ""hello"" reverse Reverses a string ""hello"" becomes ""olleh"" way.set(""someData"", ""hello"") <div way-data=""someData"" way-transform=""uppercase""></div> <!-- Renders ""HELLO"" --> registerTransform(name, transform) method Adds a new transform. way.set(""someData"", ""hello""); way.registerTransform(""lolify"", function(data) {   return data + "" lol""; }); <div way-data=""someData"" way-transform=""lolify|uppercase""></div> <!-- Renders ""HELLO LOL"" --> Helper elements Allows to perform simple tasks on your way.js' data with a click. Attribute Description way-action-remove Removes a way data way-action-push if provided with an array, pushes an null value to it Example: way.set(""some.list"", [""I"", ""am"", ""list""]); <div id=""clickToRemove"" way-action-remove=""some.list.2""></div> <div id=""clickToPush"" way-action-push=""some.list""></div> $(""#clickToRemove"").click(); $(""#clickToPush"").click(); way.get(""some.list""); >> [""I"", ""am"", null] Helper classes For images only way.js adds classes to your DOM elements to easily detect load / error / success statuses with the data they get passed. Class Description way-loading When an image is getting downloaded to a DOM element way-error When no image is returned from the URL provided way-success When... Well, you got it. way.set(""image.url"", ""somethingThatsNotAnImageURL""); <img way-data=""image.url""> <!-- Gets a class "".way-error"" attributed --> Methods Everything should be done for you from the HTML tags. But if necessary, you can also use helper functions to interact with your stored data and DOM elements. Notes: [element] refers to the CSS selector of a DOM element. [options] is optional. By default, options are read from the HTML tags of the elements. But you can overwrite them, by passing this parameter. DOM methods way.dom(element).toStorage(options) Stores the element's value to the in-store memory. way.dom(""#someForm"").toStorage() way.dom(element).fromStorage(options) Sets the element's value from the stored one. way.dom(""#someForm"").fromStorage() way.dom(element).toJSON(options) Returns a JSON with the parsed data of the input (particularly handy for forms). way.dom(""#someForm"").toJSON()  >> {         its: ""values"",         serialized: {             in: ""a json""         }     } way.dom(element).fromJSON(data, options) Sets the element's value from any data (in json). way.dom(""#someForm"").fromJSON({name:""John Doe""}) way.dom(element).getValue() Returns a structured JSON containing the value of the DOM element. way.dom(""#someForm"").getValue() way.dom(element).setValue(value, options) Sets the element's value from any data (in json). way.dom(""#someForm"").setValue({name:""John Doe""}) way.dom(element).setDefault(force) Sets the default value of an element. By default, only the DOM element gets its value set to the default value. Its bound value in the datastore in unchanged. Pass a [force] parameter if you need to force setting in-memory value of this data to the element's default value. way.dom(""#someForm"").setDefault() way.setDefaults(force) Sets all the default values of bound DOM elements. way.setDefaults() way.dom(element).getOptions() Returns the list of the [""way-""] options attributed to a DOM element. way.dom(""#someForm"").getOptions() Data methods way.get(selector) Returns the value of the data stored under a given pathname. way.get(""some.path""); >> ""bonjour"" way.set(selector, value, options) Saves the data in memory under the specified pathname. way.set(""some.path"", ""bonjour!""); way.remove(selector, options) Removes the data stored under a given pathname. way.remove(""some.path""); way.get(""some.path""); >> undefined way.clear(options) Clears all the data way.clear(); way.get(); >> {} localStorage methods way.backup() Stores the data saved in way.js' datastore to localStorage. way.backup(); way.restore() Restores the data saved in localStorage. Called on $(document).ready by default (can be changed with global options). way.restore(); Binding methods way.registerBindings() Triggers a scan of the DOM to find and save the elements with the [way-data] attribute, that will be bound with some data. way.registerBindings() way.updateBindings(selector) Sets the value of all the DOM elements binded to a data selector with their values in way.js' datastore. If omitted, all (excluding write-only's and omitted) DOM elements with a ""way-data="" attribute will be refreshed. way.updateBindings(""formData.name"") Repeat methods way.registerRepeats() Triggers a scan of the DOM to find and save the elements with the [way-repeat] attribute, that will be bound with some data. way.registerRepeats() way.updateRepeats(selector) Triggers a refresh of the repeat elements with their respective data. way.updateRepeats(""somethingToBeLooped"") Watcher methods way.watch(selector, callback[value]) Watches changes of a given value. way.watch(""some.data"", function(value) {     console.log(""Data has been updated to value: "" + value); }); way.watchAll(callback[selector, value]) Watches all changes in way.js' datastore. way.watchAll(function(selector, value) {     console.log(""The data "" + selector + "" has been changed."", value); }); Global options way.options.persistent (Boolean) Sets whether or not data will be restored from localStorage on document.ready (true by default). way.options.persistent = true way.options.timeoutInput (Number) Number of milliseconds of the timeout between keypresses on bound elements to store their values to the datastore (50 by default). way.options.timeoutInput = 50 way.options.timeoutDOM (Number) Number of milliseconds of the timeout between scans of the DOM to list bound elements on each DOM change (500 by default). way.options.timeoutDOM = 500 To do document a bit more the code test enjoy Integrations [Meteor] To be coming Contribute Fork & pull request.

Feathers is a real-time, micro-service web framework for NodeJS that gives you control over your data via RESTful resources, sockets and flexible plug-ins. Getting started You can build your first real-time API in just 4 commands: $ npm install -g feathers-cli $ mkdir my-new-app $ cd my-new-app/ $ feathers generate $ npm start To learn more about Feathers visit the website at feathersjs.com or jump right into the Feathers docs. See it in action Here is all the code you need to create a RESTful, real-time message API that uses an in-memory data store: // app.js const feathers = require('feathers'); const rest = require('feathers-rest'); const socketio = require('feathers-socketio'); const memory = require('feathers-memory'); const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); const handler = require('feathers-errors/handler');  // A Feathers app is the same as an Express app const app = feathers();  // Add REST API support app.configure(rest()); // Configure Socket.io real-time APIs app.configure(socketio()); // Parse HTTP JSON bodies app.use(bodyParser.json()); // Parse URL-encoded params app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // Register our memory ""messages"" service app.use('/messages', memory()); // Register a nicer error handler than the default Express one app.use(handler()); // Start the server app.listen(3000); Then run npm install feathers feathers-rest feathers-socketio feathers-errors feathers-memory body-parser node app  and go to http://localhost:3000/messages. That's it! There's a lot more you can do with Feathers including; using a real database, authentication, authorization, clustering and more! Head on over to the Feathers docs to see just how easy it is to build scalable real-time apps. Documentation The Feathers docs are loaded with awesome stuff and tell you every thing you need to know about using and configuring Feathers. Examples Each plugin has it's own minimal example in the repo. To see some more complex examples go to feathersjs/feathers-demos. Security We ❤️ the community and take security very seriously. No one wants their app hacked. If you have come across a security concern please report it responsibly. Visit the Security section of the docs to learn more about how you can make sure your app is secure.

If you're going to contribute code, please follow our coding standards and read our CONTRIBUTING.md. Usage Check out the KeystoneJS Getting Started Guide to start using KeystoneJS. Installation The easiest way to get started with Keystone is to use the Yeoman generator: $ npm install -g generator-keystone $ yo keystone Answer the questions, and the generator will create a new project based on the options you select, and install the required packages from npm. Alternatively, to include Keystone in an existing project or start from scratch (without Yeoman), specify keystone: ""^0.3.9"" in the dependencies array of your package.json file, and run npm install from your terminal. Then read through the Documentation and the Example Projects to understand how to use it. Example application script (keystone.js) Running in default mode, Keystone takes care of everything required to configure your application with Express, connect to your MongoDB database, and start the web server. Here is an example of what your keystone.js (or app.js, etc) file may look like: var keystone = require('keystone');  keystone.init({      'name': 'My Project',     'brand': 'Project',      'less': 'public',     'static': 'public',      'views': 'templates/views',     'view engine': 'jade',      'auth': true,     'user model': 'User',     'cookie secret': '--- your secret ---',      'auto update': true  });  keystone.import('models');  keystone.set('routes', require('./routes'));  keystone.start(); Configuration Config variables can be passed in an object to the keystone.init method, or can be set any time before keystone.start is called using keystone.set(key, value). This allows for a more flexible order of execution (e.g. if you refer to Lists in your routes, you can set the routes after configuring your Lists, as in the example above). See the KeystoneJS configuration documentation for details and examples of the available configuration options. To understand how these settings are used, and how the Express application is initialised, see Keystone.prototype.start in lib/core/start.js. Database field types Keystone builds on the basic data types provided by mongo and allows you to easily add rich, functional fields to your application's models. You get helper methods on your models for dealing with each field type easily (such as formatting a date or number, resizing an image, getting an array of the available options for a select field, or using Google's Places API to improve addresses) as well as a beautiful, responsive admin UI to edit your data with. See the KeystoneJS database documentation for details and examples of the various field types, as well as how to set up and use database models in your application. Keystone's field types include: Boolean Color Date Datetime Email Html Key Location Markdown Money Name Number Password Select Text Textarea Url Azure File CloudinaryImage CloudinaryImages Embedly LocalFile S3 File Keystone also has Relationship fields for managing one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between different models. Running KeystoneJS in Production When you deploy your KeystoneJS app to production, be sure to set your ENV environment variable to production. You can do this by setting NODE_ENV=production in your .env file, which gets handled by dotenv. Setting your environment enables certain features, including template caching, simpler error reporting and html minification, that are important in production but annoying in development. Linking Keystone for Development and Testing If you want to test or develop against the master branch of KeystoneJS (or against your own branch), rather than a published version on npm, you just need to check it out then use npm link to link it to your project. On Mac OS, this is done like this: Checkout KeystoneJS locally, e.g. to ~/Development/KeystoneJS From the KeystoneJS directory, run sudo npm link (you will need to enter your system password) From your project directory, e.g. ~/Development/MySite (the one with your package.json file in it) run npm link keystone. This will create a link between ~/Development/MySite/node_modules/keystone and ~/Development/KeystoneJS. Then require('keystone') normally in your app - the development copy will be used. Note that running npm update will ignore new versions of keystone that have been published. To go back to using a published version of KeystoneJS from npm, from your project directory, run npm unlink keystone then npm install. Testing To run the test suite run npm test.

Reaction is built with JavaScript (ES6), Meteor, Node.js and works nicely with Docker. Status 0.13.x Master ( stable ) 0.13.x - 0.14.x Development ( latest ) Reaction is expected to have a stable codebase ready for some production configurations within the next couple of major releases. Be aware though, that we're updating frequently. Even existing structures that are functionally done are getting frequent updates to ensure we're current with the most current libraries available to us. Currently good for contributing, observing progress, and testing. We'd encourage due diligence in production usage, be very comfortable with the code, and risk tolerant. There are still many parts in development! Docs Installation, configuration and development documentation is available on docs.reactioncommerce.com The Reaction documentation source is located in the reaction-docs repository, while the documentation site is the reactioncommerce/redoc application. Installation Reaction requires Meteor, Node, npm and ImageMagick Developers using Windows should review the Windows specific installation requirements for Meteor and Reaction. curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh # installs Meteor git clone https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction.git cd reaction meteor npm install ./reaction Additional setup options, such as how to set the default credentials, can be found in the installation and configuration documentation. Note: When using a standalone MongoDB server, make sure you are using version 2.6 or later. Roadmap With ongoing feature development, and strong community contributions, we have a fluid roadmap. For a high level review our roadmap, take a look at the Reaction vision page. For grouping of development channels by feature, review the project milestones.

This package is an Express application which can be extended with additional modules. All parts of this application are accesible via CompoundJS API. License Hatch.js dual-licensed under AGPL and Hatch Commercial License. AGPL means that if you fork the Hatch.js code or write a derivative application (an application which runs on the same CPU process), you must open-source and distribute your project freely under the same AGPL terms. Alternatively a commercial closed-source license is available. More details on our website. Partner with us We believe Hatch.js is a great platform for building social web applications. We are actively seeking partnerships with companies to build commercial products for any purpose on top of the platform. Contact us for more information. Dependencies Hatch.js requires Node 0.8+, Redis 2.6+ and imagemagick to be installed. Bower is also required to install client-side dependencies. npm install -g bower  Installation Use Hatch.js as an npm. Please see the examples for how to use Hatch.js in this way: npm install hatchjs  Or standalone: git clone https://github.com/inventures/hatchjs  Then: npm install bower install  Running Hatch.js Like most node apps, Hatch.js listens by default on port 3000. We recommend using Nginx or similar to proxy requests via port 80 or 443. node server  Running in production mode is strongly recommended for live sites. Assets are automatically combined, minified and strongly cached, view templates are pre-compiled resulting in better performance all round: NODE_ENV=production node . NODE_ENV=production CLUSTER=1 node .  Visit http://hostname:3000 to get started with your first group. By default Hatch.js connects to Redis DB 0 on 127.0.0.1. You can change this by modifying ./config/database.js. Package Structure Overview ./server.js Exports application server builder function. This is main entry point to application. ./app Hatch.js is express app structurized with Compound MVC, so this is standard directory structure for MVC app. It contains core models, controllers, views, helpers, assets and mailers. ./app/models Hatch.js models define all of the business object classes within the application. These can be extended by placing model class files within the /app/models folder of your app or your app's modules. Models are accessed via the application context as follows: c.ModelName.functionName(); E.g. c.Content.all({ where: { groupId: 1 }}, function (err, posts) {      // do some stuff with the results }); Hatch.js uses the RedisHQ driver which is part of JugglingDB. Redis may seem like an unusual choice for a primary database. It was chosen because the requirements of Hatch.js and derived apps are usually fairly data-light + traffic-heavy. Redis is an ideal choice because of it's lightning quick performance. Due to the asynchronous nature of Node.js + Redis and the optimised implementation of MULTI batching within the RedisHQ driver, multiple duplicate requests within the same i/o callback context are also able to share queries and results-sets meaning that performance and scalability of the solution is significantly improved over what is achievable using a more conventional database such as MongoDB or MySQL. On rudimentary hardware (e.g. a standard 1 thread AWS micro instance), Hatch.js is easily able to cope with significant levels of traffic and a large number of concurrent users. We estimate the base performance is roughly 20-30x that of platforms such as Wordpress. The Hatch.js database schema is self-explanatory and can be found here. ./lib Hatch core. Contains API and core implementation. Hatch APIs are accessible via the context in code as follows: c.compound.hatch.apiName.functionName(); Or globally: var compound = require('compound'); compound.hatch.apiName.functionName(); The available APIs, documentation and their functions can be found here: ./lib/api ./hatch_modules Built-in modules for Hatch.js. Each module is separate application mounted to root application on /do/{moduleName} route. Modules can modify the existing functionality or models or provide new features. They can be enabled or disabled on a per-group or per-application basis via the management area of each group. Modules documentation can be found within the README. ./test Before running tests ensure you have installed dev dependencies: npm install bower install  Use make test command to run all tests. While debugging / TDD use make testing command which is the same as previous, but with --watch flag. For verbose output run make test-verbose. Every piece of code should be tested (ideally). Make sure tests included in pull request. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc. Terms Privacy Security Status Help Something went wrong with that request. Please try again.

It has the following features: MongoDB as a database storage and Redis for session storage - for maximum perfomance Independent Module structure Multilanguage support out of the box Multifunctional file browser with drag-and-drop and Zip/Unzip support Built-in website statistics WYSIWYG-based page editor (based on CKEditor) Crossplatfrom - works everywhere where Node.JS does And many more 8-) Official website: https://taracot.org Demo Please take a look at the demo installation instance: https://demo.taracot.org/cp (use admin as username and admin as password). Note: the demo is automatically re-installing every hour. Installation guide Follow this guide for TaracotJS instance installation. Pre-requisites Download and install Node.js for your operating system: http://nodejs.org/download/. Node Package Manager (npm) should be installed by default; if not, please take care of it's installation. MongoDB and Redis are required. If your operating system is x64-based Windows, you may download the pre-compiled MongoDB and Redis here: https://taracot.org/source/db/mongo_redis_win64.zip. Unzip the files included to any folder on your hard disk and start using start.cmd. Two minimized console applications will be started, they should remain open every time you run TaracotJS server. For Linux/UNIX and MacOS-based operating systems you may install the corresponding MongoDB and Redis packages manually or compile from sources. Quick Start The quickest way to get started with TaracotJS is to utilize the executable taracotjs to generate an application as shown below. Install taracotjs-generator: npm install -g taracotjs-generator Create Taracot JS instance: taracotjs /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo Install dependencies: npm install Edit config.js (using your favorite text editor), don't forget to set MongoDB connection URL and Redis port. You don't have to edit secrets and salt at this point, they will be auto-generated on the next step. Perform system post-configuration: cd bin && node install-system && node install-modules Rock and Roll: node webserver If everything goes well, you will see the following message: “TaracotJS server listening on port: 3000” (3000 is the default port). Open up your favorite browser and open the following page: http://127.0.0.1:3000/. Control panel is accessible via http://127.0.0.1:3000/cp/. Default username is admin, default password is admin. Manual installation Github repository is available at: https://github.com/xtremespb/taracotjs. Use Git to checkout.

It's not ready for production yet, but you still can start to play with it and have plenty of fun ! Application stack nodejs >0.6.x express zappajs sequelize mysql redis (optional) Installation Installation has been tested under Linux, MacOS and Windows. Git, MySQL, Node.js and NPM have to be installed Make a global install of CoffeeScript npm install -g coffee-script  Retrieve NodizeCMS git clone git://github.com/nodize/nodizecms.git  Install dependencies cd nodizecms  npm install  Create a MySQL database and modify the file ""/themes/pageone/settings/database.json"" mysqladmin create pageone  Start the server coffee app.coffee  When your database is empty, a default ""admin"" user will be created with a random password at server startup : ._   _           _ _          | \ | |         | (_)         |  \| | ___   __| |_ _______  | . ` |/ _ \ / _` | |_  / _ \ | |\  | (_) | (_| | |/ /  __/ \_| \_/\___/ \__,_|_/___\___|  listening on port 3000 SuperAdmin group created Default user created, login = admin, password = 45A90 <----------- YOUR PASSWORD Default lang created Default menu created  Now you can access to the admistration module, open you browser on ""http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin"" (replace 127.0.0.1 by your server IP/URL if it's not running on the localhost). If you're still there and that everything went fine, you should have a nice but empty backend. Let's load some data : (replace ""pageone"" by your database name) mysql pageone < themes/pageone/sql/pages.sql  or (if you have some access rights defined in MySQL) : mysql pageone -u root -p < themes/pageone/sql/pages.sql  Now refresh your browser ! Do you see pages & articles ? Great ! Open a new browser window and enter this URL : ""http://127.0.0.1:3000"", if you are lucky, you're just looking at a dynamic webpage powered by Node.js & NodizeCMS !

(dixit Slawo) See http://www.cody-cms.org for more info and examples on http://github.com/jcoppieters/cody-samples You can now use npm to install Cody thanks to Jonas. Features Node.js CMS Easy-to-use graphical interface + wysiwyg (what you see is what you get) editor that allows non-programmers to manage the site's content, users, files, forms and images. Tree structured GUI to manage the structure of the site and the editable content by using templates and drag-and-drop. Works seamless with your existing node.js code. Getting Started By following these steps you will be running your own CMS system in no time. If any of the steps do not work for you, please report this as an issue on this github repository and we will look into it as soon as possible! Install nodejs and mysql Create a new directory for your cms and navigate to it (in unix):   $ mkdir codydev   $ cd codydev Install cody and its dependencies   $ npm install cody Set up a new web site using the guided scaffolding   $ node ./node_modules/cody/bin/create_site    Creating cody web tree in current directory   1) Enter sitename: mysite   Note: also using my site as database name.   Note: by default the mysql root user has no password so you can just hit enter, if you forgot the root password see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/resetting-permissions.html   2) Enter root password for mysql so we can create a new database and user:    3) Enter site database user: mysitename   4) Enter site database password: mysitepassword   5) Enter hostname for site: mysite.local (or localhost)   Site mysite has been prepared.    Please create DNS entries, or add to /etc/hosts:   127.0.0.1     mysite.local    Also check index.js and config.json to fine-tune extra parameters, encryption key, ...    Start your site using:   forever start mysite.js   or   node mysite.js Add a DNS entry for given hostname, e.g.   $ sudo bash -c 'echo 127.0.0.1 mysite.local >> /etc/hosts' Run the server   $ node mysite.js or if you want to automatically restart the server on changes   $ forever start mysite.js Go to ""http://mysite.local:3001"" to see your current site and go to ""http://mysite.local:3001/en/dashboard"" to see the CMS of the site. the default users are: 'super', 'admin', 'test' and 'user' which all have password 'empty' you can ofcourse use ""http://localhost:3001"" too. Configuration The create_site scaffolding creates a config.json file in the root of your project directory. This configuration can be adjust in the following three ways, listed in order of overwriting order (e.g. values of 2 will overwrite those of 1, etc.): Manually adjust the values in the config.json file Create your own config file and supply it at command-line with the -c option (since v3.2.5, thanks to andretw) $ node index.js -c my_overwriting_config.json Provide environment variables $ dbuser=dbuser dbpassword=dbpassword port=8080 node index.js Careful, all three cases need a server restart before they take effect! Have a look at the generated config.json file to see which configuration variables you can use. Troubleshooting I get ""ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2)"" when running the scaffold script Your mysql server is not started. On Mac OS: go to ""System Preferences"" -> ""Mysql"" -> ""Start"" On any unix machine: $ mysqld & After ""5) Enter hostname for site"" it prompts for ""Enter password:"" You entered the incorrect password for your root user of the mysql database.

If they are not then please visit http://nodejs.org and http://www.mongodb.org to install them. PencilBlue Command-line interface Install the pencilblue-cli module: sudo npm install -g pencilblue-cli Run pbctrl install [directory] where [directory] is the directory you want PencilBlue to be installed to. Follow the install instructions After the installation is done, cd into the folder where you installed PencilBlue Run pbctrl start Manual installation Clone the PencilBlue repository cd into the cloned repository's folder Run npm install to retrieve PencilBlue's dependencies. Depending on your system access privileges, you may have to run sudo npm install (Optional) Install Redis for caching (Optional) Create a custom configuration file using the provided sample.config.json. The file can reside in two places: within the root folder of your installation as config.json or at /etc/pencilblue/config.json. The installation root takes precedence. If running all services locally, no configuration file is needed, but a configuration file is necessary for overriding specific settings. Start PencilBlue. You can simply run node pencilblue, but we recommend using nodemon for development and forever for production. Nodemon will restart PencilBlue on file changes and forever will ensure that PencilBlue is always running. # development nodemon pencilblue  OR  # production sudo forever start pencilblue.js  Navigate to the site root you specified in a configuration file or http://localhost:8080 by default.

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code - anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object. We call it ""logic-less"" because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values. For a language-agnostic overview of mustache's template syntax, see the mustache(5) manpage. Where to use mustache.js? You can use mustache.js to render mustache templates anywhere you can use JavaScript. This includes web browsers, server-side environments such as node, and CouchDB views. mustache.js ships with support for both the CommonJS module API and the Asynchronous Module Definition API, or AMD. And this will be your templates after you use Mustache: Install You can get Mustache via npm. $ npm install mustache --save or install with bower: $ bower install --save mustache Command line tool mustache.js is shipped with a node based command line tool. It might be installed as a global tool on your computer to render a mustache template of some kind $ npm install -g mustache  $ mustache dataView.json myTemplate.mustache > output.html also supports stdin. $ cat dataView.json | mustache - myTemplate.mustache > output.html or as a package.json devDependency in a build process maybe? $ npm install mustache --save-dev {   ""scripts"": {     ""build"": ""mustache dataView.json myTemplate.mustache > public/output.html""   } } $ npm run build The command line tool is basically a wrapper around Mustache.render so you get all the features. If your templates use partials you should pass paths to partials using -p flag: $ mustache -p path/to/partial1.mustache -p path/to/partial2.mustache dataView.json myTemplate.mustache Who uses mustache.js? An updated list of mustache.js users is kept on the Github wiki. Add yourself or your company if you use mustache.js! Contributing mustache.js is a mature project, but it continues to actively invite maintainers. You can help out a high-profile project that is used in a lot of places on the web. There is plenty of work to do. No big commitment required, if all you do is review a single Pull Request, you are a maintainer. And a hero. Your First Contribution review a Pull Request fix an Issue update the documentation make a website write a tutorial Usage Below is a quick example how to use mustache.js: var view = {   title: ""Joe"",   calc: function () {     return 2 + 4;   } };  var output = Mustache.render(""{{title}} spends {{calc}}"", view); In this example, the Mustache.render function takes two parameters: 1) the mustache template and 2) a view object that contains the data and code needed to render the template. API Following is an rtype signature of the most commonly used functions. Mustache.render(   template  : String,   view      : Object,   partials? : Object, ) => String  Mustache.parse(   template              : String,   tags = ['{{', '}}']   : Tags, ) => String  interface Tags [String, String] Templates A mustache template is a string that contains any number of mustache tags. Tags are indicated by the double mustaches that surround them. {{person}} is a tag, as is {{#person}}. In both examples we refer to person as the tag's key. There are several types of tags available in mustache.js, described below. There are several techniques that can be used to load templates and hand them to mustache.js, here are two of them: Include Templates If you need a template for a dynamic part in a static website, you can consider including the template in the static HTML file to avoid loading templates separately. Here's a small example using jQuery: <html> <body onload=""loadUser""> <div id=""target"">Loading...</div> <script id=""template"" type=""x-tmpl-mustache""> Hello {{ name }}! </script> </body> </html> function loadUser() {   var template = $('#template').html();   Mustache.parse(template);   // optional, speeds up future uses   var rendered = Mustache.render(template, {name: ""Luke""});   $('#target').html(rendered); } Load External Templates If your templates reside in individual files, you can load them asynchronously and render them when they arrive. Another example using jQuery: function loadUser() {   $.get('template.mst', function(template) {     var rendered = Mustache.render(template, {name: ""Luke""});     $('#target').html(rendered);   }); } Variables The most basic tag type is a simple variable. A {{name}} tag renders the value of the name key in the current context. If there is no such key, nothing is rendered. All variables are HTML-escaped by default. If you want to render unescaped HTML, use the triple mustache: {{{name}}}. You can also use & to unescape a variable. If you want {{name}} not to be interpreted as a mustache tag, but rather to appear exactly as {{name}} in the output, you must change and then restore the default delimiter. See the ""Set Delimiter"" section for more information about custom delimiters. View: {   ""name"": ""Chris"",   ""company"": ""<b>GitHub</b>"" } Template: * {{name}} * {{age}} * {{company}} * {{{company}}} * {{&company}} {{=<% %>=}} * {{company}} <%={{ }}=%>  Output: * Chris * * &lt;b&gt;GitHub&lt;/b&gt; * <b>GitHub</b> * <b>GitHub</b> * {{company}} JavaScript's dot notation may be used to access keys that are properties of objects in a view. View: {   ""name"": {     ""first"": ""Michael"",     ""last"": ""Jackson""   },   ""age"": ""RIP"" } Template: * {{name.first}} {{name.last}} * {{age}} Output: * Michael Jackson * RIP Sections Sections render blocks of text one or more times, depending on the value of the key in the current context. A section begins with a pound and ends with a slash. That is, {{#person}} begins a person section, while {{/person}} ends it. The text between the two tags is referred to as that section's ""block"". The behavior of the section is determined by the value of the key. False Values or Empty Lists If the person key does not exist, or exists and has a value of null, undefined, false, 0, or NaN, or is an empty string or an empty list, the block will not be rendered. View: {   ""person"": false } Template: Shown. {{#person}} Never shown! {{/person}} Output: Shown. Non-Empty Lists If the person key exists and is not null, undefined, or false, and is not an empty list the block will be rendered one or more times. When the value is a list, the block is rendered once for each item in the list. The context of the block is set to the current item in the list for each iteration. In this way we can loop over collections. View: {   ""stooges"": [     { ""name"": ""Moe"" },     { ""name"": ""Larry"" },     { ""name"": ""Curly"" }   ] } Template: {{#stooges}} <b>{{name}}</b> {{/stooges}} Output: <b>Moe</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>Curly</b> When looping over an array of strings, a . can be used to refer to the current item in the list. View: {   ""musketeers"": [""Athos"", ""Aramis"", ""Porthos"", ""D'Artagnan""] } Template: {{#musketeers}} * {{.}} {{/musketeers}} Output: * Athos * Aramis * Porthos * D'Artagnan If the value of a section variable is a function, it will be called in the context of the current item in the list on each iteration. View: {   ""beatles"": [     { ""firstName"": ""John"", ""lastName"": ""Lennon"" },     { ""firstName"": ""Paul"", ""lastName"": ""McCartney"" },     { ""firstName"": ""George"", ""lastName"": ""Harrison"" },     { ""firstName"": ""Ringo"", ""lastName"": ""Starr"" }   ],   ""name"": function () {     return this.firstName + "" "" + this.lastName;   } } Template: {{#beatles}} * {{name}} {{/beatles}} Output: * John Lennon * Paul McCartney * George Harrison * Ringo Starr Functions If the value of a section key is a function, it is called with the section's literal block of text, un-rendered, as its first argument. The second argument is a special rendering function that uses the current view as its view argument. It is called in the context of the current view object. View: {   ""name"": ""Tater"",   ""bold"": function () {     return function (text, render) {       return ""<b>"" + render(text) + ""</b>"";     }   } } Template: {{#bold}}Hi {{name}}.{{/bold}} Output: <b>Hi Tater.</b> Inverted Sections An inverted section opens with {{^section}} instead of {{#section}}. The block of an inverted section is rendered only if the value of that section's tag is null, undefined, false, falsy or an empty list. View: {   ""repos"": [] } Template: {{#repos}}<b>{{name}}</b>{{/repos}} {{^repos}}No repos :({{/repos}} Output: No repos :( Comments Comments begin with a bang and are ignored. The following template: <h1>Today{{! ignore me }}.</h1> Will render as follows: <h1>Today.</h1> Comments may contain newlines. Partials Partials begin with a greater than sign, like {{> box}}. Partials are rendered at runtime (as opposed to compile time), so recursive partials are possible. Just avoid infinite loops. They also inherit the calling context. Whereas in ERB you may have this: <%= partial :next_more, :start => start, :size => size %> Mustache requires only this: {{> next_more}} Why? Because the next_more.mustache file will inherit the size and start variables from the calling context. In this way you may want to think of partials as includes, imports, template expansion, nested templates, or subtemplates, even though those aren't literally the case here. For example, this template and partial: base.mustache: <h2>Names</h2> {{#names}}   {{> user}} {{/names}}  user.mustache: <strong>{{name}}</strong>  Can be thought of as a single, expanded template: <h2>Names</h2> {{#names}}   <strong>{{name}}</strong> {{/names}} In mustache.js an object of partials may be passed as the third argument to Mustache.render. The object should be keyed by the name of the partial, and its value should be the partial text. Mustache.render(template, view, {   user: userTemplate }); Set Delimiter Set Delimiter tags start with an equals sign and change the tag delimiters from {{ and }} to custom strings. Consider the following contrived example: * {{ default_tags }} {{=<% %>=}} * <% erb_style_tags %> <%={{ }}=%> * {{ default_tags_again }} Here we have a list with three items. The first item uses the default tag style, the second uses ERB style as defined by the Set Delimiter tag, and the third returns to the default style after yet another Set Delimiter declaration. According to ctemplates, this ""is useful for languages like TeX, where double-braces may occur in the text and are awkward to use for markup."" Custom delimiters may not contain whitespace or the equals sign. Pre-parsing and Caching Templates By default, when mustache.js first parses a template it keeps the full parsed token tree in a cache. The next time it sees that same template it skips the parsing step and renders the template much more quickly. If you'd like, you can do this ahead of time using mustache.parse. Mustache.parse(template);  // Then, sometime later. Mustache.render(template, view); Plugins for JavaScript Libraries mustache.js may be built specifically for several different client libraries, including the following: jQuery MooTools Dojo YUI qooxdoo These may be built using Rake and one of the following commands: $ rake jquery $ rake mootools $ rake dojo $ rake yui3 $ rake qooxdoo Testing In order to run the tests you'll need to install node. You also need to install the sub module containing Mustache specifications in the project root. $ git submodule init $ git submodule update Install dependencies. $ npm install Then run the tests. $ npm test The test suite consists of both unit and integration tests. If a template isn't rendering correctly for you, you can make a test for it by doing the following: Create a template file named mytest.mustache in the test/_files directory. Replace mytest with the name of your test. Create a corresponding view file named mytest.js in the same directory. This file should contain a JavaScript object literal enclosed in parentheses. See any of the other view files for an example. Create a file with the expected output in mytest.txt in the same directory. Then, you can run the test with: $ TEST=mytest npm run test-render Browser tests Browser tests are not included in npm test as they run for too long, although they are ran automatically on Travis when merged into master. Run browser tests locally in any browser: $ npm run test-browser-local then point your browser to http://localhost:8080/__zuul Troubleshooting npm install fails Ensure to have a recent version of npm installed. While developing this project requires npm with support for ^ version ranges. $ npm install -g npm Thanks mustache.js wouldn't kick ass if it weren't for these fine souls: Chris Wanstrath / defunkt Alexander Lang / langalex Sebastian Cohnen / tisba J Chris Anderson / jchris Tom Robinson / tlrobinson Aaron Quint / quirkey Douglas Crockford Nikita Vasilyev / NV Elise Wood / glytch Damien Mathieu / dmathieu Jakub Kuźma / qoobaa Will Leinweber / will dpree Jason Smith / jhs Aaron Gibralter / agibralter Ross Boucher / boucher Matt Sanford / mzsanford Ben Cherry / bcherry Michael Jackson / mjackson Phillip Johnsen / phillipj David da Silva Contín / dasilvacontin Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Handlebars.js and Mustache are both logicless templating languages that keep the view and the code separated like we all know they should be. Checkout the official Handlebars docs site at http://www.handlebarsjs.com and the live demo at http://tryhandlebarsjs.com/. Installing See our installation documentation. Usage In general, the syntax of Handlebars.js templates is a superset of Mustache templates. For basic syntax, check out the Mustache manpage. Once you have a template, use the Handlebars.compile method to compile the template into a function. The generated function takes a context argument, which will be used to render the template. var source = ""<p>Hello, my name is {{name}}. I am from {{hometown}}. I have "" +              ""{{kids.length}} kids:</p>"" +              ""<ul>{{#kids}}<li>{{name}} is {{age}}</li>{{/kids}}</ul>""; var template = Handlebars.compile(source);  var data = { ""name"": ""Alan"", ""hometown"": ""Somewhere, TX"",              ""kids"": [{""name"": ""Jimmy"", ""age"": ""12""}, {""name"": ""Sally"", ""age"": ""4""}]}; var result = template(data);  // Would render: // <p>Hello, my name is Alan. I am from Somewhere, TX. I have 2 kids:</p> // <ul> //   <li>Jimmy is 12</li> //   <li>Sally is 4</li> // </ul> Full documentation and more examples are at handlebarsjs.com. Precompiling Templates Handlebars allows templates to be precompiled and included as javascript code rather than the handlebars template allowing for faster startup time. Full details are located here. Differences Between Handlebars.js and Mustache Handlebars.js adds a couple of additional features to make writing templates easier and also changes a tiny detail of how partials work. Nested Paths Helpers Block Expressions Literal Values Delimited Comments Block expressions have the same syntax as mustache sections but should not be confused with one another. Sections are akin to an implicit each or with statement depending on the input data and helpers are explicit pieces of code that are free to implement whatever behavior they like. The mustache spec defines the exact behavior of sections. In the case of name conflicts, helpers are given priority. Compatibility There are a few Mustache behaviors that Handlebars does not implement. Handlebars deviates from Mustache slightly in that it does not perform recursive lookup by default. The compile time compat flag must be set to enable this functionality. Users should note that there is a performance cost for enabling this flag. The exact cost varies by template, but it's recommended that performance sensitive operations should avoid this mode and instead opt for explicit path references. The optional Mustache-style lambdas are not supported. Instead Handlebars provides its own lambda resolution that follows the behaviors of helpers. Alternative delimiters are not supported. Supported Environments Handlebars has been designed to work in any ECMAScript 3 environment. This includes Node.js Chrome Firefox Safari 5+ Opera 11+ IE 6+ Older versions and other runtimes are likely to work but have not been formally tested. The compiler requires JSON.stringify to be implemented natively or via a polyfill. If using the precompiler this is not necessary. Performance In a rough performance test, precompiled Handlebars.js templates (in the original version of Handlebars.js) rendered in about half the time of Mustache templates. It would be a shame if it were any other way, since they were precompiled, but the difference in architecture does have some big performance advantages. Justin Marney, a.k.a. gotascii, confirmed that with an independent test. The rewritten Handlebars (current version) is faster than the old version, with many performance tests being 5 to 7 times faster than the Mustache equivalent.

Hogan.js is a compiler for the Mustache templating language. For information on Mustache, see the manpage and the spec. Basics Hogan compiles templates to HoganTemplate objects, which have a render method. var data = {   screenName: ""dhg"", };  var template = Hogan.compile(""Follow @{{screenName}}.""); var output = template.render(data);  // prints ""Follow @dhg."" console.log(output); Features Hogan is fast--try it on your workload. Hogan has separate scanning, parsing and code generation phases. This way it's possible to add new features without touching the scanner at all, and many different code generation techniques can be tried without changing the parser. Hogan exposes scan and parse methods. These can be useful for pre-processing templates on the server. var text = ""{{^check}}{{#i18n}}No{{/i18n}}{{/check}}""; text +=  ""{{#check}}{{#i18n}}Yes{{/i18n}}{{/check}}""; var tree = Hogan.parse(Hogan.scan(text));  // outputs ""# check"" console.log(tree[0].tag + "" "" + tree[0].name);  // outputs ""Yes"" console.log(tree[1].nodes[0].nodes[0]); It's also possible to use HoganTemplate objects without the Hogan compiler present. That means you can pre-compile your templates on the server, and avoid shipping the compiler. However, the optional lambda features from the Mustache spec require the compiler and the original template source to be present. Hogan also supports template inheritance, and maintains compatibility with other implementations like mustache.java, mustache.php, and GRMustache Why Hogan.js? Why another templating library? Hogan.js was written to meet three templating library requirements: good performance, standalone template objects, and a parser API. Install Node.js npm install hogan.js  component component install twitter/hogan.js  Compilation options The second argument to Hogan.compile is an options hash. var text = ""my <%example%> template."" Hogan.compile(text, {delimiters: '<% %>'}); There are currently four valid options. asString: return the compiled template as a string. This feature is used by hulk to produce strings containing pre-compiled templates. sectionTags: allow custom tags that require opening and closing tags, and treat them as though they were section tags. var text = ""my {{_foo}}example{{/foo}} template."" Hogan.compile(text, { sectionTags: [{o: '_foo', c: 'foo'}]}); The value is an array of object with o and c fields that indicate names for custom section tags. The example above allows parsing of {{_foo}}{{/foo}}. delimiters: A string that overrides the default delimiters. Example: ""<% %>"". disableLambda: disables the higher-order sections / lambda-replace features of Mustache. Issues Have a bug? Please create an issue here on GitHub! https://github.com/twitter/hogan.js/issues Versioning For transparency and insight into our release cycle, releases will be numbered with the follow format: <major>.<minor>.<patch> And constructed with the following guidelines: Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch For more information on semantic versioning, please visit http://semver.org/. Testing To run the tests you first need to update all git submodules. $ git submodule init $ git submodule update  Unit tests are written using QUnit. To run them, open test/index.html in a browser.

Details It ignores sub-directories. Template files can have multiple extensions at the same time. Files with .def extension can be included in other files via {{#def.name}} Files with .dot extension are compiled into functions with the same name and can be accessed as renderer.filename Files with .jst extension are compiled into .js files. Produced .js file can be loaded as a commonJS, AMD module, or just installed into a global variable (default is set to window.render) All inline defines defined in the .jst file are compiled into separate functions and are available via _render.filename.definename Basic usage:       var dots = require(""dot"").process({path: ""./views""});       dots.mytemplate({foo:""hello world""});  The above snippet will: Compile all templates in views folder (.dot, .def, .jst) Place .js files compiled from .jst templates into the same folder These files can be used with require, i.e. require(""./views/mytemplate"") Return an object with functions compiled from .dot templates as its properties Render mytemplate template CLI tool to compile dot templates into js files ./bin/dot-packer -s examples/views -d out/views  Example for express Many people are using doT with express.

It's like EJS and ERB, but with CoffeeScript inside the <% ... %>. Use it from Node.js to render your application's views on the server side, or compile your templates to JavaScript with the eco command-line utility and use them to dynamically render views in the browser. Here's how an Eco template looks: <% if @projects.length: %>   <% for project in @projects: %>     <a href=""<%= project.url %>""><%= project.name %></a>     <p><%= project.description %></p>   <% end %> <% else: %>   No projects <% end %>  Usage Use eco.render() to render your templates. The first argument is the template source as a string. The second argument is the context object which contains your view state and any helper methods you want to call. eco = require ""eco"" fs  = require ""fs""  template = fs.readFileSync __dirname + ""/views/projects.html.eco"", ""utf-8"" console.log eco.render template, projects: [   { name: ""Mobile app"", url: ""/projects/1"", description: ""Iteration 1"" },   { name: ""Home page redesign"", url: ""/projects/2"" } ]  Eco is fully synchronous. If your template needs to access data from asynchronous operations, perform those first before calling render. Language reference Eco's syntax is simple: <% expression %>: Evaluate a CoffeeScript expression without printing its return value. <%= expression %>: Evaluate a CoffeeScript expression, escape its return value, and print it. <%- expression %>: Evaluate a CoffeeScript expression and print its return value without escaping it. <%= @property %>: Print the escaped value of the property property from the context object passed to render. <%= @helper() %>: Call the helper method helper from the context object passed to render, then print its escaped return value. <% @helper -> %>...<% end %>: Call the helper method helper with a function as its first argument. When invoked, the function will capture and return the content ... inside the tag. <%% and %%> will result in a literal <% and %> in the rendered template, respectively. A note about whitespace CoffeeScript is whitespace-sensitive, but your templates aren't. Therefore, Eco code tags that begin an indented CoffeeScript block must be suffixed with a colon. To indicate the end of an indented block, use the special tag <% end %>. For example: <% if @project.isOnHold(): %>   On Hold <% end %>  You don't need to write the if and end tags on separate lines: <% if @project.isOnHold(): %> On Hold <% end %>  And you can use the single-line postfix form of if as you'd expect: <%= ""On Hold"" if @project.isOnHold() %>  Certain forms in CoffeeScript, such as else, must be unindented first. Eco handles that for you automatically: <% if @project.isOnHold(): %>   On Hold <% else if @project.isArchived(): %>   Archived <% end %>  The context object The context object you pass to eco.render() becomes the value of this inside your template. You can use CoffeeScript's @ sigil to easily access properties and call helper methods on the context object. eco.render ""<p><%= @description %></p>"",   description: ""HTML 5 mobile app""  Helpers Helper methods on your context object can access other properties on the context object in the same way they're accessed in the template: through this, or with the @ sigil. translations = require ""translations""  eco.render ""<span><%= @translate 'common.welcomeText' %></span>"",   language:  ""en""   translate: (key) ->     translations[@language][key]  Escaping and unescaping When you print an expression in a template with <%= ... %>, its value is HTML-escaped. For example, eco.render ""<%= @description %>"",   description: ""<strong>HTML 5</strong> mobile app""  would render: &lt;strong&gt;HTML 5&lt;/strong&gt; mobile app  You can use the <%- ... %> tag to print the value of an expression without escaping it. So this code: eco.render ""<%- @description %>"",   description: ""<strong>HTML 5</strong> mobile app""  would produce: <strong>HTML 5</strong> mobile app  It is sometimes useful to generate markup in helper methods. The special safe method on the context object tells Eco that the string can be printed in <%= ... %> tags without being escaped. You can use this in conjunction with the context object's escape method to selectively sanitize parts of the string. For example, eco.render ""<%= @linkTo @project %>"",   project: { id: 4, name: ""Crate & Barrel"" }   linkTo: (project) ->     url  = ""/projects/#{project.id}""     name = @escape project.name     @safe ""<a href='#{url}'>#{name}</a>""  would render: <a href='/projects/4'>Crate &amp; Barrel</a>  Custom escape helpers By default, Eco's escape method takes a string and returns an HTML-escaped string. You can override this behavior to escape for formats other than HTML, or to bypass escaping entirely. For example, eco.render ""From: <%= @address %>"",   address: ""Sam Stephenson <sstephenson@gmail.com>""   escape:  (string) -> string  would return: From: Sam Stephenson <sstephenson@gmail.com>  Blocks and capturing You can capture blocks of a template by wrapping them in a function definition. For example, rendering this template: <% div = (contents) => %>    <div><%- contents %></div> <% end %> <%= div ""Hello"" %>  would produce: <div>Hello</div>  Captured blocks can be passed to helper methods too. In this example, the capture body is passed to the formFor helper as its last argument. Then the formFor helper calls this argument to produce a value. template = """"""   <%= @formFor @project, (form) => %>     <label>Name:</label>     <%= form.textField ""name"" %>   <% end %> """"""  eco.render template,   project: { id: 1, name: ""Mobile app"" }   formFor: (project, yield_to) ->     form =       textField: (attribute) =>         name  = @escape attribute         value = @escape @project[attribute]         @safe ""<input type='text' name='#{name}' value='#{value}'>""      url  = ""/projects/#{@project.id}""     body = yield_to form     @safe ""<form action='#{url}' method='post'>#{body}</form>""  Note: In general, you should use CoffeeScript's fat arrow (=>) to define capturing functions, so that you have access to the context object inside the captured block. Treat the plain arrow (->) as an optimization, for when you are certain the capture body will not need to reference properties or helper methods on the context object.

Compatible with server-side environments like Node.js, module loaders like RequireJS, Browserify or webpack and all web browsers. Usage Client-side Include the (minified) JavaScript Templates script in your HTML markup: <script src=""js/tmpl.min.js""></script> Add a script section with type ""text/x-tmpl"", a unique id property and your template definition as content: <script type=""text/x-tmpl"" id=""tmpl-demo""> <h3>{%=o.title%}</h3> <p>Released under the <a href=""{%=o.license.url%}"">{%=o.license.name%}</a>.</p> <h4>Features</h4> <ul> {% for (var i=0; i<o.features.length; i++) { %}     <li>{%=o.features[i]%}</li> {% } %} </ul> </script> ""o"" (the lowercase letter) is a reference to the data parameter of the template function (see the API section on how to modify this identifier). In your application code, create a JavaScript object to use as data for the template: var data = {     ""title"": ""JavaScript Templates"",     ""license"": {         ""name"": ""MIT license"",         ""url"": ""http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT""     },     ""features"": [         ""lightweight & fast"",         ""powerful"",         ""zero dependencies""     ] }; In a real application, this data could be the result of retrieving a JSON resource. Render the result by calling the tmpl() method with the id of the template and the data object as arguments: document.getElementById(""result"").innerHTML = tmpl(""tmpl-demo"", data); Server-side The following is an example how to use the JavaScript Templates engine on the server-side with node.js. Create a new directory and add the tmpl.js file. Or alternatively, install the blueimp-tmpl package with npm: npm install blueimp-tmpl Add a file template.html with the following content: <!DOCTYPE HTML> <title>{%=o.title%}</title> <h3><a href=""{%=o.url%}"">{%=o.title%}</a></h3> <h4>Features</h4> <ul> {% for (var i=0; i<o.features.length; i++) { %}     <li>{%=o.features[i]%}</li> {% } %} </ul> Add a file server.js with the following content: require(""http"").createServer(function (req, res) {     var fs = require(""fs""),         // The tmpl module exports the tmpl() function:         tmpl = require(""./tmpl""),         // Use the following version if you installed the package with npm:         // tmpl = require(""blueimp-tmpl""),         // Sample data:         data = {             ""title"": ""JavaScript Templates"",             ""url"": ""https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Templates"",             ""features"": [                 ""lightweight & fast"",                 ""powerful"",                 ""zero dependencies""             ]         };     // Override the template loading method:     tmpl.load = function (id) {         var filename = id + "".html"";         console.log(""Loading "" + filename);         return fs.readFileSync(filename, ""utf8"");     };     res.writeHead(200, {""Content-Type"": ""text/x-tmpl""});     // Render the content:     res.end(tmpl(""template"", data)); }).listen(8080, ""localhost""); console.log(""Server running at http://localhost:8080/""); Run the application with the following command: node server.js Requirements The JavaScript Templates script has zero dependencies. API tmpl() function The tmpl() function is added to the global window object and can be called as global function: var result = tmpl(""tmpl-demo"", data); The tmpl() function can be called with the id of a template, or with a template string: var result = tmpl(""<h3>{%=o.title%}</h3>"", data); If called without second argument, tmpl() returns a reusable template function: var func = tmpl(""<h3>{%=o.title%}</h3>""); document.getElementById(""result"").innerHTML = func(data); Templates cache Templates loaded by id are cached in the map tmpl.cache: var func = tmpl(""tmpl-demo""), // Loads and parses the template     cached = typeof tmpl.cache[""tmpl-demo""] === ""function"", // true     result = tmpl(""tmpl-demo"", data); // Uses cached template function  tmpl.cache[""tmpl-demo""] = null; result = tmpl(""tmpl-demo"", data); // Loads and parses the template again Output encoding The method tmpl.encode is used to escape HTML special characters in the template output: var output = tmpl.encode(""<>&\""'\x00""); // Renders ""&lt;&gt;&amp;&quot;&#39;"" tmpl.encode makes use of the regular expression tmpl.encReg and the encoding map tmpl.encMap to match and replace special characters, which can be modified to change the behavior of the output encoding. Strings matched by the regular expression, but not found in the encoding map are removed from the output. This allows for example to automatically trim input values (removing whitespace from the start and end of the string): tmpl.encReg = /(^\s+)|(\s+$)|[<>&""'\x00]/g; var output = tmpl.encode(""    Banana!    ""); // Renders ""Banana"" (without whitespace) Local helper variables The local variables available inside the templates are the following: o: The data object given as parameter to the template function (see the next section on how to modify the parameter name). tmpl: A reference to the tmpl function object. _s: The string for the rendered result content. _e: A reference to the tmpl.encode method. print: Helper function to add content to the rendered result string. include: Helper function to include the return value of a different template in the result. To introduce additional local helper variables, the string tmpl.helper can be extended. The following adds a convenience function for console.log and a streaming function, that streams the template rendering result back to the callback argument (note the comma at the beginning of each variable declaration): tmpl.helper += "",log=function(){console.log.apply(console, arguments)}"" +     "",st='',stream=function(cb){var l=st.length;st=_s;cb( _s.slice(l));}""; Those new helper functions could be used to stream the template contents to the console output: <script type=""text/x-tmpl"" id=""tmpl-demo""> <h3>{%=o.title%}</h3> {% stream(log); %} <p>Released under the <a href=""{%=o.license.url%}"">{%=o.license.name%}</a>.</p> {% stream(log); %} <h4>Features</h4> <ul> {% stream(log); %} {% for (var i=0; i<o.features.length; i++) { %}     <li>{%=o.features[i]%}</li>     {% stream(log); %} {% } %} </ul> {% stream(log); %} </script> Template function argument The generated template functions accept one argument, which is the data object given to the tmpl(id, data) function. This argument is available inside the template definitions as parameter o (the lowercase letter). The argument name can be modified by overriding tmpl.arg: tmpl.arg = ""p"";  // Renders ""<h3>JavaScript Templates</h3>"": var result = tmpl(""<h3>{%=p.title%}</h3>"", {title: ""JavaScript Templates""}); Template parsing The template contents are matched and replaced using the regular expression tmpl.regexp and the replacement function tmpl.func. The replacement function operates based on the parenthesized submatch strings. To use different tags for the template syntax, override tmpl.regexp with a modified regular expression, by exchanging all occurrences of ""{%"" and ""%}"", e.g. with ""[%"" and ""%]"": tmpl.regexp = /([\s'\\])(?!(?:[^[]|\[(?!%))*%\])|(?:\[%(=|#)([\s\S]+?)%\])|(\[%)|(%\])/g; By default, the plugin preserves whitespace (newlines, carriage returns, tabs and spaces). To strip unnecessary whitespace, you can override the tmpl.func function, e.g. with the following code: var originalFunc = tmpl.func; tmpl.func = function (s, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, offset, str) {     if (p1 && /\s/.test(p1)) {         if (!offset || /\s/.test(str.charAt(offset - 1)) ||                 /^\s+$/g.test(str.slice(offset))) {             return '';         }         return ' ';     }     return originalFunc.apply(tmpl, arguments); }; Templates syntax Interpolation Print variable with HTML special characters escaped: <h3>{%=o.title%}</h3> Print variable without escaping: <h3>{%#o.user_id%}</h3> Print output of function calls: <a href=""{%=encodeURI(o.url)%}"">Website</a> Use dot notation to print nested properties: <strong>{%=o.author.name%}</strong> Evaluation Use print(str) to add escaped content to the output: <span>Year: {% var d=new Date(); print(d.getFullYear()); %}</span> Use print(str, true) to add unescaped content to the output: <span>{% print(""Fast &amp; powerful"", true); %}</span> Use include(str, obj) to include content from a different template: <div> {% include('tmpl-link', {name: ""Website"", url: ""https://example.org""}); %} </div> If else condition: {% if (o.author.url) { %}     <a href=""{%=encodeURI(o.author.url)%}"">{%=o.author.name%}</a> {% } else { %}     <em>No author url.</em> {% } %} For loop: <ul> {% for (var i=0; i<o.features.length; i++) { %}     <li>{%=o.features[i]%}</li> {% } %} </ul> Compiled templates The JavaScript Templates project comes with a compilation script, that allows you to compile your templates into JavaScript code and combine them with a minimal Templates runtime into one combined JavaScript file. The compilation script is built for node.js. To use it, first install the JavaScript Templates project via npm: npm install blueimp-tmpl This will put the executable tmpl.js into the folder node_modules/.bin. It will also make it available on your PATH if you install the package globally (by adding the -g flag to the install command). The tmpl.js executable accepts the paths to one or multiple template files as command line arguments and prints the generated JavaScript code to the console output. The following command line shows you how to store the generated code in a new JavaScript file that can be included in your project: tmpl.js index.html > tmpl.js The files given as command line arguments to tmpl.js can either be pure template files or HTML documents with embedded template script sections. For the pure template files, the file names (without extension) serve as template ids. The generated file can be included in your project as a replacement for the original tmpl.js runtime. It provides you with the same API and provides a tmpl(id, data) function that accepts the id of one of your templates as first and a data object as optional second parameter. Tests The JavaScript Templates project comes with Unit Tests. There are two different ways to run the tests: Open test/index.html in your browser or run npm test in the Terminal in the root path of the repository package. The first one tests the browser integration, the second one the node.js integration. License The JavaScript Templates script is released under the MIT license.

For bug reports, feature requests and questions, open an issue. For discussion join the chat room. You can test drive Pug online here. Rename from ""Jade"" This project was formerly known as ""Jade."" However, it has been revealed to us that ""Jade"" is a registered trademark, and as a result a rename is needed. After some discussion among the maintainers, ""Pug"" has been chosen as the new name for this project. The next major version will carry ""pug"" as the package name. If your package or app currently uses jade, don't worry: we have secured permissions to continue to occupy that package name, although all new versions will be released under pug. Pug 2.0.0 is still under beta stage, and there are several syntactic differences we have deprecated and removed. Such differences are documented at #2305. The website and documentation for Pug are still being updated, but if you are new to Pug, you should get started with the new syntax and install the Pug package on npm. Installation Package via npm: $ npm install pug Command Line After installing the latest version of Node.js, install with: $ npm install pug-cli -g and run with $ pug --help Syntax Pug is a clean, whitespace sensitive syntax for writing html. Here is a simple example: doctype html html(lang=""en"")   head     title= pageTitle     script(type='text/javascript').       if (foo) bar(1 + 5)   body     h1 Pug - node template engine     #container.col       if youAreUsingPug         p You are amazing       else         p Get on it!       p.         Pug is a terse and simple templating language with a         strong focus on performance and powerful features. becomes <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=""en"">   <head>     <title>Pug</title>     <script type=""text/javascript"">       if (foo) bar(1 + 5)     </script>   </head>   <body>     <h1>Pug - node template engine</h1>     <div id=""container"" class=""col"">       <p>You are amazing</p>       <p>Pug is a terse and simple templating language with a strong focus on performance and powerful features.</p>     </div>   </body> </html> The official Pug tutorial is a great place to start. API For full API, see jade-lang.com/api var pug = require('pug');  // compile var fn = pug.compile('string of pug', options); var html = fn(locals);  // render var html = pug.render('string of pug', merge(options, locals));  // renderFile var html = pug.renderFile('filename.pug', merge(options, locals)); Options filename Used in exceptions, and required when using includes compileDebug When false no debug instrumentation is compiled pretty Add pretty-indentation whitespace to output (false by default) Browser Support The latest version of pug can be download for the browser in standalone form from here. It only supports the very latest browsers though, and is a large file. It is recommended that you pre-compile your pug templates to JavaScript and then just use the runtime.js library on the client. To compile a template for use on the client using the command line, do: $ pug --client --no-debug filename.pug which will produce filename.js containing the compiled template.

In that case, you'll end up with local variables for all the passed options. However, be aware that your code could break if we add an option with the same name as one of your data object's properties. Therefore, we do not recommend using this shortcut. Options cache Compiled functions are cached, requires filename filename The name of the file being rendered. Not required if you are using renderFile(). Used by cache to key caches, and for includes. root Set project root for includes with an absolute path (/file.ejs). context Function execution context compileDebug When false no debug instrumentation is compiled client When true, compiles a function that can be rendered in the browser without needing to load the EJS Runtime (ejs.min.js). delimiter Character to use with angle brackets for open/close debug Output generated function body strict When set to true, generated function is in strict mode _with Whether or not to use with() {} constructs. If false then the locals will be stored in the locals object. Set to false in strict mode. localsName Name to use for the object storing local variables when not using with Defaults to locals rmWhitespace Remove all safe-to-remove whitespace, including leading and trailing whitespace. It also enables a safer version of -%> line slurping for all scriptlet tags (it does not strip new lines of tags in the middle of a line). escape The escaping function used with <%= construct. It is used in rendering and is .toString()ed in the generation of client functions. (By default escapes XML). This project uses JSDoc. For the full public API documentation, clone the repository and run npm run doc. This will run JSDoc with the proper options and output the documentation to out/. If you want the both the public & private API docs, run npm run devdoc instead. Tags <% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output <%_ 'Whitespace Slurping' Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it <%= Outputs the value into the template (escaped) <%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template <%# Comment tag, no execution, no output <%% Outputs a literal '<%' %%> Outputs a literal '%>' %> Plain ending tag -%> Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline _%> 'Whitespace Slurping' ending tag, removes all whitespace after it For the full syntax documentation, please see docs/syntax.md. Includes Includes either have to be an absolute path, or, if not, are assumed as relative to the template with the include call. For example if you are including ./views/user/show.ejs from ./views/users.ejs you would use <%- include('user/show') %>. You must specify the filename option for the template with the include call unless you are using renderFile(). You'll likely want to use the raw output tag (<%-) with your include to avoid double-escaping the HTML output. <ul>   <% users.forEach(function(user){ %>     <%- include('user/show', {user: user}) %>   <% }); %> </ul> Includes are inserted at runtime, so you can use variables for the path in the include call (for example <%- include(somePath) %>). Variables in your top-level data object are available to all your includes, but local variables need to be passed down. NOTE: Include preprocessor directives (<% include user/show %>) are still supported. Custom delimiters Custom delimiters can be applied on a per-template basis, or globally: var ejs = require('ejs'),     users = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'];  // Just one template ejs.render('<?= users.join("" | ""); ?>', {users: users}, {delimiter: '?'}); // => 'geddy | neil | alex'  // Or globally ejs.delimiter = '$'; ejs.render('<$= users.join("" | ""); $>', {users: users}); // => 'geddy | neil | alex' Caching EJS ships with a basic in-process cache for caching the intermediate JavaScript functions used to render templates. It's easy to plug in LRU caching using Node's lru-cache library: var ejs = require('ejs')   , LRU = require('lru-cache'); ejs.cache = LRU(100); // LRU cache with 100-item limit If you want to clear the EJS cache, call ejs.clearCache. If you're using the LRU cache and need a different limit, simple reset ejs.cache to a new instance of the LRU. Layouts EJS does not specifically support blocks, but layouts can be implemented by including headers and footers, like so: <%- include('header') -%> <h1>   Title </h1> <p>   My page </p> <%- include('footer') -%> Client-side support Go to the Latest Release, download ./ejs.js or ./ejs.min.js. Alternately, you can compile it yourself by cloning the repository and running jake build (or $(npm bin)/jake build if jake is not installed globally). Include one of these files on your page, and ejs should be available globally. Example <div id=""output""></div> <script src=""ejs.min.js""></script> <script>   var people = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'],       html = ejs.render('<%= people.join("", ""); %>', {people: people});   // With jQuery:   $('#output').html(html);   // Vanilla JS:   document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = html; </script> Caveats Most of EJS will work as expected; however, there are a few things to note: Obviously, since you do not have access to the filesystem, ejs.renderFile() won't work. For the same reason, includes do not work unless you use an IncludeCallback. Here is an example: var str = ""Hello <%= include('file', {person: 'John'}); %>"",     fn = ejs.compile(str, {client: true});  fn(data, null, function(path, d){ // IncludeCallback   // path -> 'file'   // d -> {person: 'John'}   // Put your code here    // Return the contents of file as a string }); // returns rendered string Related projects There are a number of implementations of EJS: TJ's implementation, the v1 of this library: https://github.com/tj/ejs Jupiter Consulting's EJS: http://www.embeddedjs.com/ EJS Embedded JavaScript Framework on Google Code: https://code.google.com/p/embeddedjavascript/ Sam Stephenson's Ruby implementation: https://rubygems.org/gems/ejs Erubis, an ERB implementation which also runs JavaScript: http://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/users-guide.04.html#lang-javascript License Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) EJS Embedded JavaScript templates copyright 2112 mde@fleegix.org.

Marko runs on Node.js and in the browser and it supports streaming, async rendering and custom tags. Templates are compiled to readable CommonJS modules. Learn more on markojs.com, and even Try Marko Online! Installation npm install marko --save Syntax Marko supports both a familiar HTML syntax, as well as a more concise indentation-based syntax. Both syntaxes are equally supported. Regardless of which syntax you choose, the compiled code will be exactly the same. HTML syntax <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=""en"">     <head>         <title>Marko Templating Engine</title>     </head>     <body>         <h1>             Hello ${data.name}!         </h1>          <ul if(notEmpty(data.colors))>             <li for(color in data.colors)>                 ${color}             </li>         </ul>         <div else>             No colors!         </div>     </body> </html> Concise syntax The following concise template is equivalent to the previous template: <!DOCTYPE html> html lang=""en""     head         title - Marko Templating Engine     body         h1 - Hello ${data.name}!         ul if(notEmpty(data.colors))             li for(color in data.colors)                 ${color}         div else             - No colors! Mixed syntax You can even mix and match the concise syntax with the HTML syntax within the same document. The following template is equivalent to the previous templates: <!DOCTYPE html> html lang=""en""     head         title - Marko Templating Engine     body         <h1>             Hello ${data.name}!         </h1>         ul if(notEmpty(data.colors))             li for(color in data.colors)                 ${color}         div else             - No colors! Basic Usage Loading a template var template = require('./template.marko'); NOTE: On the server, you will need to install the Node.js require extension for Marko: require('marko/node-require').install(); Rendering a template var templateData = { name: 'Frank' };  // Render to an existing Writable stream: template.render(templateData, process.stdout);  // Render to a callback function: template.render(templateData, function(err, html) {         console.log(html);     });  // Render a template synchronously console.log(template.renderSync(templateData));  // Render a template and return a new Readable stream: template.stream(templateData).pipe(process.stdout); UI Components Marko Widgets is a minimalist library for building isomorphic/universal UI components with the help of the Marko templating engine. Marko renders the HTML for UI components, while Marko Widgets adds client-side behavior. Client-side behavior includes the following: Handling DOM events Emitting custom events Handling custom events emitted by other widgets Manipulating and updating the DOM Marko Widgets offers advanced features like DOM-diffing, batched updates, stateful widgets, declarative event binding and efficient event delegation. Changing a widgets state or properties will result in the DOM automatically being updated without writing extra code. Marko Widgets has adopted many of the good design principles promoted by the React team, but aims to be much lighter and often faster (especially on the server). When updating the view for a widget, Marko Widgets uses DOM diffing to make the minimum number of changes to the DOM through the use of the morphdom module. UI components are defined using very clean JavaScript code. For example: module.exports = require('marko-widgets').defineComponent({     /**      * The template to use as the view      */     template: require('./template.marko'),      /**      * Return the initial state for the UI component based on      * the input properties that were provided.      */     getInitialState: function(input) {         return {             greetingName: input.greetingName,             clickCount: 0         };     },      /**      * Return an object that is used as the template data. The      * template data should be based on the current widget state      * that is passed in as the first argument      */     getTemplateData: function(state) {         var clickCount = state.clickCount;         var timesMessage = clickCount === 1 ? 'time' : 'times';          return {             greetingName: state.greetingName,             clickCount: clickCount,             timesMessage: timesMessage         };     },      /**      * This is the constructor for the widget. Called once when      * the widget is first added to the DOM.      */     init: function() {         var el = this.el;         // ""el"" will be reference the raw HTML element that this         // widget is bound to. You can do whatever you want with it...         // el.style.color = 'red';     },      /**      * Handler method for the button ""click"" event. This method name      * matches the name of the `w-onClick` attribute in the template.      */     handleButtonClick: function(event, el) {         this.setState('clickCount', this.state.clickCount + 1);     },      /**      * Expose a method to let other code change the ""greeting name"".      * If the value of the ""greetingName"" state property changes      * then the UI component will automatically rerender and the      * DOM will be updated.      */     setGreetingName: function(newName) {         this.setState('greetingName', newName);     } }); And, here is the corresponding Marko template for the UI component: <div class=""click-count"" w-bind>     Hello ${data.greetingName}!     <div>         You clicked the button ${data.clickCount} ${data.timesMessage}.     </div>     <button type=""button"" w-onclick=""handleButtonClick"">         Click Me     </button> </div> Try Marko Widgets Online! For more details on Marko Widgets, please check out the Marko Widgets Documentation. Common issues nodemon When marko compiles your server-side templates, a .marko.js file is created next to the original .marko file. Subsequently, nodemon will see the new .marko.js file and trigger a restart of your app and this can repeat indefinitely unless you configure nodemon to ignore *.marko.js files. To avoid this, simply add ""ignore"": [""*.marko.js""] to the nodemon.json file at the root of your project. As a better drop-in replacement with more features, you can install browser-refresh. Be sure to add *.marko.js pattern to your .gitignore file and browser-refresh will automatically ignore the compiled marko templates when they are written to disk.

Features Available for node.js and major web browsers! Express compatible. Object-Oriented template inheritance. Apply filters and transformations to output in your templates. Automatically escapes all output for safe HTML rendering. Lots of iteration and conditionals supported. Robust without the bloat. Extendable and customizable. See Swig-Extras for some examples. Great code coverage. Need Help? Have Questions? Comments? Mailing List/Google Group StackOverflow Migration Guide Installation npm install swig  Documentation All documentation can be viewed online on the Swig Website. Basic Example Template code <h1>{{ pagename|title }}</h1> <ul> {% for author in authors %}     <li{% if loop.first %} class=""first""{% endif %}>{{ author }}</li> {% endfor %} </ul> node.js code var swig  = require('swig'); var template = swig.compileFile('/absolute/path/to/template.html'); var output = template({     pagename: 'awesome people',     authors: ['Paul', 'Jim', 'Jane'] }); Output <h1>Awesome People</h1> <ul>     <li class=""first"">Paul</li>     <li>Jim</li>     <li>Jane</li> </ul> For working example see examples/basic How it works Swig reads template files and translates them into cached javascript functions. When we later render a template we call the evaluated function, passing a context object as an argument.

Jul 8, 2016 testem.json Fix #585 - update MG to work with D3 v4 Jul 7, 2016 README.md MetricsGraphics.js is a library optimized for visualizing and laying out time-series data. At under 80KB (minified), it provides a simple way to produce common types of graphics in a principled and consistent way. The library currently supports line charts, scatterplots, histograms, bar charts and data tables, as well as features like rug plots and basic linear regression. A sample set of examples may be found on the examples page. The example below demonstrates how easy it is to produce a graphic. Our graphics function provides a robust layer of indirection, allowing one to more efficiently build, say, a dashboard of interactive graphics, each of which may be pulling data from a different data source. For the complete list of options, and for download instructions, take a look at the sections below. MG.data_graphic({     title: 'Downloads',     description: 'This graphics shows Firefox GA downloads for the past six months.',     data: downloads_data, // an array of objects, such as [{value:100,date:...},...]     width: 600,     height: 250,     target: '#downloads', // the html element that the graphic is inserted in     x_accessor: 'date',  // the key that accesses the x value     y_accessor: 'value' // the key that accesses the y value }) The API is simple. All that's needed to create a graphic is to specify a few default parameters and then, if desired, override one or more of the optional parameters on offer. We don't maintain state. In order to update a graphic, one would call MG.data_graphic on the same target element. The library is data-source agnostic. While it provides a number of convenience functions and options that allow for graphics to better handle things like missing observations, it doesn't care where the data comes from. Though originally envisioned for Mozilla Metrics dashboard projects, we are making this repository public for other to use, knowing full well that we are far from having this project in good-enough shape. Take a look at the issues to see the milestones and other upcoming work on this repository. We are currently using semantic versioning. http://metricsgraphicsjs.org Important changes in v2.10 The library now depends on D3 4. The impact on MG users is minimal, though if you do use D3 for other work, here is the list of changes from 3.x to 4.x. The release notes for MG v2.10, planned for release in mid-July 2016, will include further details. Important changes in v2.0 The library is now namespaced. data_graphic is now MG.data_graphic, convert_dates is now MG.convert.date, clone is now MG.clone, button_layout is now MG.button_layout and data_table is now MG.data_table. We added a new convenience function called MG.convert.number. The rollover_callback option has been renamed mouseover and expanded in order to make it more consistent with other libraries. We now have three callback functions available: mouseover, mouseout and mousemove. CSS rules have been prefixed and in some cases updated for consistency. active_datapoint for instance is now mg-active-datapoint. Quick-start guide Download the latest release. Follow the examples here and here to see how graphics are laid out and built. The examples use JSON data from examples/data, though you may easily pull data from elsewhere. Dependencies The library depends on D3 and jQuery. As of v2.2, if you do not wish to use jQuery, set show_tooltips to false, either globally in metricsgraphics.js, or within every MG.data_graphic call. Only tooltips and buttons depend on jQuery. Contributing If you would like to help extend MetricsGraphics.js or fix bugs, please fork the library and install Node.js. Then, from the project's root directory install gulp: npm install gulp  Then, install the library's dependencies: npm install  To build the library from source, type: gulp build:js  To run tests, type: gulp test  To run the development server (accessible at http://localhost:4300): gulp serve  You might also be interested in writing addons for the library, in which case, have a read through this page. Resources Examples Interactive demo List of options Convenience functions Hooks Chart types Developing addons Building a button layout Download package The download package includes everything that you see on metricsgraphicsjs.org. In order to use the library in your own project, the only files that you'll need are the ones under dist. Remember to load D3 and jQuery. If you don't care about tooltips or the button layout, you won't need the latter. If your project uses Bootstrap, make sure you load MetricsGraphics.js after it. Frequently asked questions What does MetricsGraphics.js do that library x doesn't do? If library x works for you, you should keep using it. We're not aiming to be competitive with libraries that already exist. We're aiming to make a library that meets our needs. We also happen to think that the world needs a principled data presentation library, and that many of our needs are the same as other folks'. I only see the first five lines in my chart, what gives? The colors for the first five lines, areas and legends are defined in the stylesheet for the light and dark themes. For a sixth line, you would add the follow CSS rules: .mg-line6-color {     stroke: steelblue; }  .mg-area6-color {     fill: steelblue; }  .mg-hover-line6-color {     fill: steelblue; }  .mg-line6-legend-color {     color: steelblue; } If you're plotting more than five lines in the same chart and using color to encode some dimension of the data, then you probably need to rethink the chart. I get an error when I load MG alongside library x If your project uses Bootstrap, make sure you load MetricsGraphics.js after it. If your project uses jQuery UI, load it after MetricsGraphics.js.

It includes 26+ well-designed, themeable, responsive, modular, real-time and easy to use charts and 109+ maps. Focus on Design: The primary goal of a chart is to communicate data. Everything else is secondary! We have put in a lot of care to get the basics right for every chart and set them as defaults so you avoid common data visualisation mistakes right from the start. Smart defaults: We originally built this charting library so our developers could get charts up very quickly. The API is simple enough for someone with minimum knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS to get started. Comprehensive overrides: Then designers would override the defaults to custom design the charts and make the final dashboard extremely intuitive for readers. Experts can override almost every single aspect. Alternatively, you can use the Live Editor to visually override the configuration.

It then creates a WebGL renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the document.body element. Finally it animates the cube within the scene for the camera. var scene, camera, renderer; var geometry, material, mesh;  init(); animate();  function init() {      scene = new THREE.Scene();      camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 1, 10000 );     camera.position.z = 1000;      geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 200, 200, 200 );     material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0xff0000, wireframe: true } );      mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );     scene.add( mesh );      renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();     renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );      document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );  }  function animate() {      requestAnimationFrame( animate );      mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;     mesh.rotation.y += 0.02;      renderer.render( scene, camera );  } If everything went well you should see this.

Jul 13, 2016 README.md Paper.js - The Swiss Army Knife of Vector Graphics Scripting If you want to work with Paper.js, simply download the latest ""stable"" version from http://paperjs.org/download/ Website: http://paperjs.org/ Discussion forum: http://groups.google.com/group/paperjs Mainline source code: https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js Twitter: @paperjs Latest releases: http://paperjs.org/download/ Pre-built development versions: prebuilt/module and prebuilt/dist branches. Installing Paper.js The recommended way to install and maintain Paper.js as a dependency in your project is through NPM or Bower for browsers, and through NPM for Node.js. If NPM or Bower is already installed, simply type one of these commands in your project folder: npm install paper  or: bower install paper  Upon execution, you will find a paper folder inside the project's node_modules / bower_components folder. For more information on how to install NPM and Bower, read the chapter Installing Node.js, NPM and Bower. To learn more about its features for dependence tracking, see http://bower.io/. Which Version to Use? The various distributions come with two different pre-build versions of Paper.js, in minified and normal variants: paper-full.js – The full version for the browser, including PaperScript support and Acorn.js paper-core.js – The core version for the browser, without PaperScript support nor Acorn.js. You can use this to shave off some bytes and compilation time when working with JavaScript directly. Installing Node.js, NPM and Bower Node.js is required by Bower, as well as by Gulp.js, which needs to be installed if you intend to build the library or its documentation by yourself. There are many tutorials explaining the different ways to install Node.js on different platforms. It is generally not recommended to install Node.js through OS-supplied package managers, as the its development cycles move fast and these versions are often out-of-date. NVM can be used instead to install and maintain multiple versions of Node.js on the same platform, as often required by different projects: http://blog.dynamicprogrammer.com/2014/02/18/installing-node-js-on-mac-osx.html on OSX, Homebrew is also a good option if one version of Node.js on the platform is enough: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac Homebrew is recommended on OSX also if you intend to install Paper.js for Node.js, as described in the next paragraph. For Linux see http://nodejs.org/download/ to locate 32-bit and 64-bit nodejs binaries as well as sources, or use NVM: http://learn.bevry.me/node/install/ Once Node.js (with NPM) has been installed you can install bower globally using the following command: npm install -g bower  And from there onwards, you should be able to use Bower like this: bower search paperjs  Installing Paper.js for Node.js through NPM NPM is used to install Paper.js for use in Node.js. But before installing, you need the Cairo Graphics library installed, see: http://cairographics.org/. Installing Cairo and Pango on OSX: The easiest way to install Cairo is install Homebrew http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/ then issue the command: brew install cairo pango  Note that currently there is an issue on OSX with Cairo. If the above causes errors, the following will most likely fix it: PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig/ npm install paper  Also, whenever you would like to update the modules, you will need to execute: PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig/ npm update  If you keep forgetting about this requirement, or would like to be able to type simple and clean commands, add this to your .bash_profile file: # PKG Config for Pango / Cairo export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig  After adding this line, your commands should work in the expected way: npm install paper npm update  Installing Cairo, Pango and all other dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu Linux: sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libssl-dev libjpeg62-dev libgif-dev  You might also need to install the build-essential package if you don't usually build from c++ sources: sudo apt-get install build-essential  After Cairo has been installed: You should now be able to install the Paper.js module from NPM: npm install paper  Development The main Paper.js source tree is hosted on GitHub. git is required to create a clone of the repository, and can be easily installed through your preferred package manager on your platform. Get the Source git clone --recursive git://github.com/paperjs/paper.js.git cd paper.js  To refresh your clone and fetch changes from origin, run: git fetch origin  To update the jsdoc-toolkit submodule, used to generate the documentation, run: git submodule update  --init --recursive  Setting Up For Building As of 2016, Paper.js uses Gulp.js for building, and has a couple of dependencies as Bower and NPM modules. Read the chapter Installing Node.js, NPM and Bower if you still need to install these. In order to be able to build Paper.js, after checking out the repository, paper has dependencies that need to be installed. Install them by issuing the following commands from the Paper.js directory: npm install  It is also recommended to install Gulp.js globally, so you can easier execute the build commands from anywhere in the command line: npm install -g gulp  Building the Library The Paper.js sources are distributed across many separate files, organised in subfolders inside the src folder. To compile them all into distributable files, you can run the build task: gulp build  You will then find the built library files inside the dist folder, named paper-full.js and paper-core.js, along with their minified versions. Read more about this in Which Version to Use?. Running Directly from Separate Source Files As a handy alternative to building the library after each change to try it out in your scripts, there is the load task, that replaces the built libraries with symbolic links to the scrc/load.js script. This script then load the library directly from all the separate source files in the src folder, through the Prepro.js JavaScript preprocessing library. This means you can switch between loading from sources and loading a built library simply by running. gulp load  And to go back to a built library gulp build  Note that your PaperScripts examples do not need to change, they can keep loading dist/paper-full.js, which will always do the right thing. Note also that src/load.js handles both browsers and Node.js, as supported by Prepro.js. Other Build Tasks Create a final zipped distribution file inside the dist folder: gulp dist  And since dist is the default task, this is the same: gulp  Branch structure Since the release of version 0.9.22, Paper.js has adopted aspects of the Git- Flow workflow. All development is taking place in the develop branch, which is only merged into master when a new release occurs. As of version 0.9.26, the dist folder is excluded on all branches, and the building is now part of the npm publish process by way of the prepublish script. We also offer prebuilt versions of the latest state of the develop branch on prebuilt/module and prebuilt/dist. Building the Documentation Similarly to building the library, you can run the docs task to build the documentation: gulp docs  Your docs will then be located at dist/docs. Testing Paper.js was developed and tested from day 1 using proper unit testing through jQuery's Qunit. To run the tests after any change to the library's source, simply open index.html inside the test folder in your web browser. There should be a green bar at the top, meaning all tests have passed. If the bar is red, some tests have not passed. These will be highlighted and become visible when scrolling down. If you are testing on Chrome, some of the tests will fail due to the browser's CORS restrictions. In order to run the browser based tests on Chrome, you need to run a local web-server through Gulp.js. The following command will handle it for you, and will also open the browser at the right address straight away: gulp test:browser  You can also run the unit tests through PhantomJS in Gulp directly on the command line: gulp test:phantom  To test the Node.js version of Paper.js, use this command: gulp test:node  And to test both the PhantomJS and Node.js environments together, simply run: gulp test  Contributing The main Paper.js source tree is hosted on GitHub, thus you should create a fork of the repository in which you perform development. See http://help.github.com/forking/. We prefer that you send a pull request on GitHub which will then be merged into the official main line repository. You need to sign the Paper.js CLA to be able to contribute (see below). Also, in your first contribution, add yourself to the end of AUTHORS.md (which of course is optional). Get the source (for contributing): If you want to contribute to the project you will have to make a fork. Then do this: git clone --recursive git@github.com:yourusername/paper.js.git cd paper.js git remote add upstream git://github.com/paperjs/paper.js.git  To then fetch changes from upstream, run git fetch upstream  Creating and Submitting a Patch As mentioned above, we prefer that you send a pull request on GitHub: Create a fork of the upstream repository by visiting https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/fork. If you feel insecure, here's a great guide: http://help.github.com/forking/ Clone of your repository: git clone https://yourusername@github.com/yourusername/paper.js.git This is important: Create a so-called topic branch based on the develop branch: git checkout -tb name-of-my-patch develop where name-of-my-patch is a short but descriptive name of the patch you're about to create. Don't worry about the perfect name though -- you can change this name at any time later on. Hack! Make your changes, additions, etc., commit them then push them to your GitHub fork: git push origin name-of-my-patch Send a pull request to the upstream repository's owner by visiting your repository's site at GitHub (i.e. https://github.com/yourusername/paper.js) and press the ""Pull Request"" button. Make sure you are creating the pull request to the develop branch, not the master branch. Here's a good guide on pull requests: http://help.github.com/pull-requests/ Use one topic branch per feature: Don't mix different kinds of patches in the same branch. Instead, merge them all together into your develop branch (or develop everything in your develop branch and then cherry-pick-and-merge into the different topic branches). Git provides for an extremely flexible workflow, which in many ways causes more confusion than it helps you when new to collaborative software development. The guides provided by GitHub at http://help.github.com/ are a really good starting point and reference. If you are fixing an issue, a convenient way to name the branch is to use the issue number as a prefix, like this: git checkout -tb issue-937-feature-add-text-styling.

It is an interactive object model on top of canvas element. It is also an SVG-to-canvas parser. Using Fabric.js, you can create and populate objects on canvas; objects like simple geometrical shapes — rectangles, circles, ellipses, polygons, or more complex shapes consisting of hundreds or thousands of simple paths. You can then scale, move, and rotate these objects with the mouse; modify their properties — color, transparency, z-index, etc. You can also manipulate these objects altogether — grouping them with a simple mouse selection. Non-Technical Introduction to Fabric Fabric.js allows you to easily create simple shapes like rectangles, circles, triangles and other polygons or more complex shapes made up of many paths, onto the HTML <canvas> element on a webpage using JavaScript. Fabric.js will then allow you to manipulate the size, position and rotation of these objects with a mouse. It’s also possible to change some of the attributes of these objects such as their color, transparency, depth position on the webpage or selecting groups of these objects using the Fabric.js library. Fabric.js will also allow you to convert an SVG image into JavaScript data that can be used for putting it onto the <canvas> element. Contributions are very much welcome! Goals Unit tested (2400+ tests at the moment) Modular (~60 small ""classes"", modules, mixins) Cross-browser Fast Encapsulated in one object No browser sniffing for critical functionality Runs under ES5 strict mode Runs on a server under Node.js (0.8, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12) (see Node.js limitations) Follows Semantic Versioning Supported browsers Firefox 2+ Safari 3+ Opera 9.64+ Chrome (all versions) IE9, IE10, IE11, Edge With help of Explorer Canvas IE8 (incomplete — about 17 failing tests at the moment) IE7,6 (incomplete - about 27 failing tests at the moment) See Fabric limitations in Old IE. Note: to properly make old IE work, you will need to add html5shiv as a conditional comment in your HEAD, particularly html5shiv-printshiv.js to allow for children elements: <!--[if lt IE 9]>     <script src=""path/to/your/html5shiv-printshiv.js""></script> <![endif]-->  Remember to add Explorer Canvas as well. You can run automated unit tests right in the browser. History Fabric.js started as a foundation for design editor on printio.ru — interactive online store with ability to create your own designs. The idea was to create Javascript-based editor, which would make it easy to manipulate vector shapes and images on T-Shirts. Since performance was one of the most critical requirements, we chose canvas over SVG. While SVG is excellent with static shapes, it's not as performant as canvas when it comes to dynamic manipulation of objects (movement, scaling, rotation, etc.). Fabric.js was heavily inspired by Ernest Delgado's canvas experiment. In fact, code from Ernest's experiment was the foundation of an entire framework. Later, Fabric.js grew into a collection of distinct object types and got an SVG-to-canvas parser. Install with bower $ bower install fabric  Install with npm To install Fabric.js using npm, you must first manually install Cairo on your system. Cairo is a system library which powers node-canvas, which Fabric.js relies on. When the installation is complete, you may need to restart your terminal or command prompt before installing fabric. $ npm install fabric --save  Building Install Node.js Build distribution file [~77K minified, ~20K gzipped] $ node build.js  2.1 Or build a custom distribution file, by passing (comma separated) module names to be included.   $ node build.js modules=text,serialization,parser   // or   $ node build.js modules=text   // or   $ node build.js modules=parser,text   // etc.  By default (when none of the modules are specified) only basic functionality is included. See the list of modules below for more information on each one of them. Note that default distribution has support for static canvases only. To get minimal distribution with interactivity, make sure to include corresponding module:   $ node build.js modules=interaction  2.2 You can also include all modules like so:   $ node build.js modules=ALL  2.3 You can exclude a few modules like so:   $ node build.js modules=ALL exclude=gestures,image_filters  Create a minified distribution file # Using YUICompressor (default option) $ node build.js modules=... minifier=yui  # or Google Closure Compiler $ node build.js modules=... minifier=closure  Enable AMD support via require.js (requires uglify) $ node build.js requirejs modules=...  Create source map file for better productive debugging (requires uglify or google closure compiler). More information about source maps. $ node build.js sourcemap modules=...  If you use google closure compiler you have to add sourceMappingURL manually at the end of the minified file all.min.js (see issue https://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/issues/detail?id=941). //# sourceMappingURL=fabric.min.js.map  Lint source code (prerequisite: npm -g install jshint) $ jshint src  Ensure code guidelines are met (prerequisite: npm -g install jscs) $ jscs src  Testing Install Node.js Install NPM, if necessary Install NPM packages $ npm install  Run test suite $ npm test  Demos Demos Kitchensink demo Benchmarks Who's using Fabric? Documentation Documentation is always available at http://fabricjs.com/docs/. Also see official 4-part intro series, presentation from BK.js and presentation from Falsy Values for an overview of fabric.js, how it works, and its features. Optional modules These are the optional modules that could be specified for inclusion, when building custom version of fabric: text — Adds support for static text (fabric.Text) itext — Adds support for interactive text (fabric.IText) serialization — Adds support for loadFromJSON, loadFromDatalessJSON, and clone methods on fabric.Canvas interaction — Adds support for interactive features of fabric — selecting/transforming objects/groups via mouse/touch devices. parser — Adds support for fabric.parseSVGDocument, fabric.loadSVGFromURL, and fabric.loadSVGFromString image_filters — Adds support for image filters, such as grayscale of white removal. easing — Adds support for animation easing functions node — Adds support for running fabric under node.js, with help of jsdom and node-canvas libraries. freedrawing — Adds support for free drawing gestures — Adds support for multitouch gestures with help of Event.js object_straightening — Adds support for rotating an object to one of 0, 90, 180, 270, etc. depending on which is angle is closer. animation — Adds support for animation (fabric.util.animate, fabric.util.requestAnimFrame, fabric.Object#animate, fabric.Canvas#fxCenterObjectH/#fxCenterObjectV/#fxRemove) Additional flags for build script are: requirejs — Makes fabric requirejs AMD-compatible in dist/fabric.js. Note: an unminified, requirejs-compatible version is always created in dist/fabric.require.js no-strict — Strips ""use strict"" directives from source no-svg-export — Removes svg exporting functionality no-es5-compat - Removes ES5 compat methods (Array.prototype., String.prototype., Function.prototype.*) sourcemap - Generates a sourceMap file and adds the sourceMappingURL (only if uglifyjs is used) to dist/fabric.min.js For example: node build.js modules=ALL exclude=json no-strict no-svg-export  Examples of use Adding red rectangle to canvas <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> </head> <body>     <canvas id=""canvas"" width=""300"" height=""300""></canvas>      <script src=""lib/fabric.js""></script>     <script>         var canvas = new fabric.Canvas('canvas');          var rect = new fabric.Rect({             top : 100,             left : 100,             width : 60,             height : 70,             fill : 'red'         });          canvas.add(rect);     </script> </body> </html> Helping Fabric Fabric on Bountysource Fabric on CodeTriage Staying in touch Follow @fabric.js or @kangax on twitter.

Visit the library website for more information: http://raphaeljs.com http://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/ Quickstart guide You need to have NPM installed to build the library. git clone https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael.git npm run start npm run build To run tests you need to open dev/test/index.html in your browser, there's no automated way right now. Dependencies eve Distributable All files are UMD compliant. You can use: raphael.min.js (includes eve and it's minified) raphael.js (includes eve and it's not minified) raphael.no-deps.js (doesn't include eve it's not minified) raphael.no-deps.min.js (doesn't include eve it's minified) Where to start Check Raphael-boilerplate to see examples of loading. Raphael can be loaded in a script tag or with AMD: define([ ""path/to/raphael"" ], function( Raphael ) {   console.log( Raphael ); }); Development Versions will be released as we gather and test new PRs. As there are a lot of browsers being supported it might take a while to accept a PR, we will use the feedback from other users too. You can use the raphaelTest.html to try things, you need to start a server in the root dir to start testing things there. Something like running python -m SimpleHTTPServer in the raphael directory and hitting http://localhost:8000/dev/raphaelTest.html with the browser. You should run npm run start before this can work.

The library is designed to be easy to use, handle large amounts of dynamic data, and enable manipulation of the data. The library consists of the following components: DataSet and DataView. A flexible key/value based data set. Add, update, and remove items. Subscribe on changes in the data set. A DataSet can filter and order items, and convert fields of items. DataView. A filtered and/or formatted view on a DataSet. Graph2d. Plot data on a timeline with lines or barcharts. Graph3d. Display data in a three dimensional graph. Network. Display a network (force directed graph) with nodes and edges. Timeline. Display different types of data on a timeline. The vis.js library is developed by Almende B.V. Install Install via npm: $ npm install vis  Install via bower: $ bower install vis  Link via cdnjs: http://cdnjs.com Or download the library from the github project: https://github.com/almende/vis.git. Load To use a component, include the javascript and css files of vis in your web page: <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html> <head>   <script src=""components/vis/dist/vis.js""></script>   <link href=""components/vis/dist/vis.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" /> </head> <body>   <script type=""text/javascript"">     // ... load a visualization   </script> </body> </html> or load vis.js using require.js. Note that vis.css must be loaded too. require.config({   paths: {     vis: 'path/to/vis/dist',   } }); require(['vis'], function (math) {   // ... load a visualization }); A timeline can be instantiated as: var timeline = new vis.Timeline(container, data, options); Where container is an HTML element, data is an Array with data or a DataSet, and options is an optional object with configuration options for the component. Example A basic example on loading a Timeline is shown below. More examples can be found in the examples directory of the project. <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html> <head>   <title>Timeline basic demo</title>   <script src=""vis/dist/vis.js""></script>   <link href=""vis/dist/vis.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" />    <style type=""text/css"">     body, html {       font-family: sans-serif;     }   </style> </head> <body> <div id=""visualization""></div>  <script type=""text/javascript"">   var container = document.getElementById('visualization');   var data = [     {id: 1, content: 'item 1', start: '2013-04-20'},     {id: 2, content: 'item 2', start: '2013-04-14'},     {id: 3, content: 'item 3', start: '2013-04-18'},     {id: 4, content: 'item 4', start: '2013-04-16', end: '2013-04-19'},     {id: 5, content: 'item 5', start: '2013-04-25'},     {id: 6, content: 'item 6', start: '2013-04-27'}   ];   var options = {};   var timeline = new vis.Timeline(container, data, options); </script> </body> </html> Build To build the library from source, clone the project from github $ git clone git://github.com/almende/vis.git  The source code uses the module style of node (require and module.exports) to organize dependencies. To install all dependencies and build the library, run npm install in the root of the project. $ cd vis $ npm install  Then, the project can be build running: $ npm run build  To automatically rebuild on changes in the source files, once can use $ npm run watch  This will both build and minify the library on changes. Minifying is relatively slow, so when only the non-minified library is needed, one can use the watch-dev script instead: $ npm run watch-dev  Custom builds The folder dist contains bundled versions of vis.js for direct use in the browser. These bundles contain the all visualizations and includes external dependencies such as hammer.js and moment.js. The source code of vis.js consists of commonjs modules, which makes it possible to create custom bundles using tools like Browserify or Webpack. This can be bundling just one visualization like the Timeline, or bundling vis.js as part of your own browserified web application. Note that hammer.js version 2 is required as of v4. Prerequisites Before you can do a build: Install node.js and npm on your system: https://nodejs.org/ Install the following modules using npm: browserify, babelify, and uglify-js: $ [sudo] npm install -g browserify babelify uglify-js  Download or clone the vis.js project: $ git clone https://github.com/almende/vis.git  Install the dependencies of vis.js by running npm install in the root of the project: $ cd vis $ npm install  Example 1: Bundle a single visualization For example, to create a bundle with just the Timeline and DataSet, create an index file named custom.js in the root of the project, containing: exports.DataSet = require('./lib/DataSet'); exports.Timeline = require('./lib/timeline/Timeline'); Then create a custom bundle using browserify, like: $ browserify custom.js -t babelify -o vis-custom.js -s vis  This will generate a custom bundle vis-custom.js, which exposes the namespace vis containing only DataSet and Timeline. The generated bundle can be minified using uglifyjs: $ uglifyjs vis-custom.js -o vis-custom.min.js  The custom bundle can now be loaded like: <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html> <head>   <script src=""vis-custom.min.js""></script>   <link href=""dist/vis.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" /> </head> <body>   ... </body> </html> Example 2: Exclude external libraries The default bundle vis.js is standalone and includes external dependencies such as hammer.js and moment.js. When these libraries are already loaded by the application, vis.js does not need to include these dependencies itself too. To build a custom bundle of vis.js excluding moment.js and hammer.js, run browserify in the root of the project: $ browserify index.js -t babelify -o vis-custom.js -s vis -x moment -x hammerjs  This will generate a custom bundle vis-custom.js, which exposes the namespace vis, and has moment and hammerjs excluded. The generated bundle can be minified with uglifyjs: $ uglifyjs vis-custom.js -o vis-custom.min.js  The custom bundle can now be loaded as: <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html> <head>   <!-- load external dependencies -->   <script src=""http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.7.0/moment.min.js""></script>   <script src=""http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hammer.js/1.1.3/hammer.min.js""></script>    <!-- load vis.js -->   <script src=""vis-custom.min.js""></script>   <link href=""dist/vis.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" /> </head> <body>   ... </body> </html> Example 3: Bundle vis.js as part of your (commonjs) application When writing a web application with commonjs modules, vis.js can be packaged automatically into the application. Create a file app.js containing: var moment = require('moment'); var DataSet = require('vis/lib/DataSet'); var Timeline = require('vis/lib/timeline/Timeline');  var container = document.getElementById('visualization'); var data = new DataSet([   {id: 1, content: 'item 1', start: moment('2013-04-20')},   {id: 2, content: 'item 2', start: moment('2013-04-14')},   {id: 3, content: 'item 3', start: moment('2013-04-18')},   {id: 4, content: 'item 4', start: moment('2013-04-16'), end: moment('2013-04-19')},   {id: 5, content: 'item 5', start: moment('2013-04-25')},   {id: 6, content: 'item 6', start: moment('2013-04-27')} ]); var options = {}; var timeline = new Timeline(container, data, options); Install the application dependencies via npm: $ npm install vis moment  The application can be bundled and minified: $ browserify app.js -o app-bundle.js -t babelify  $ uglifyjs app-bundle.js -o app-bundle.min.js  And loaded into a webpage: <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html> <head>   <link href=""node_modules/vis/dist/vis.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" /> </head> <body>   <div id=""visualization""></div>    <script src=""app-bundle.min.js""></script> </body> </html> Test To test the library, install the project dependencies once: $ npm install  Then run the tests: $ npm test  License Copyright (C) 2010-2015 Almende B.V.

Home • Examples • Documentation • Help Usage Download the minified library and include it in your html. <script src=""js/two.min.js""></script> It can also be installed via npm npm install --save two.js Alternatively see how to build the library yourself. Here is boilerplate html in order to draw a spinning rectangle in two.js: <!doctype html> <html>   <head>     <meta charset=""utf-8"">     <script src=""js/two.min.js""></script>   </head>   <body>     <script>       var two = new Two({         fullscreen: true,         autostart: true       }).appendTo(document.body);       var rect = two.makeRectangle(two.width / 2, two.height / 2, 50 ,50);       two.bind('update', function() {         rect.rotation += 0.001;       });     </script>   </body> </html> Custom Build Two.js uses nodejs in order to build source files. You'll first want to install that. Next you'll want to install grunt: cd two.js npm install grunt  You can edit the files that we be included in the build by modifying ./Gruntfile.js. If you're making an application and you're only using one renderer (i.e: svg context) then it is highly recommended to remove canvas and webgl renderers from your build in order to drastically decrease your file size. Finally, build the project: grunt  If you are having problems running the closure compiler (it requires a JDK to be installed), run grunt build-uglify  instead to minify the build with uglify.

See documentation for all configurable options on the g prototype. g.markers has been removed. The marker parameter strings now just try and resolve functions on the Paper prototype. All primitive shapes have been removed. They are now part of Raphaël core in plugins/ The companion function original to the brightness functions lighter and darker has been renamed to resetBrightness to account for the g namespace removal Tooltips have been modified/enhanced in the following ways: All tooltips can now be called on any Element or Set instance, as well as from the paper object. All tooltip update functions have been removed. Tooltip functions now return their path element. It is up to the caller to manage both the Element or set that is used as the context and the path element that was drawn by the tooltip function. All tooltip dir options have been changed from 0, 1, 2, 3, to 'down', 'left', 'up', 'right' repectively. blob and drop tooltips no longer accept size parameters. Instead, the bounding box of the Element/Set being used as content is used to automatically determine the size. popupit and labelit have been removed. Their functionality is now the default behavior of all tooltips Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Resources The website provides a global overview of the project, and the documentation is available in the Github Wiki. Also, the plugins and examples directories contain various use-cases that might help you understand how to use sigma. How to use it To use it, clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:jacomyal/sigma.js.git  To build the code: Install Node.js. Install gjslint. Use npm install to install sigma development dependencies. Use npm run build to minify the code with Uglify. The minified file sigma.min.js will then be accessible in the build/ folder. Also, you can customize the build by adding or removing files from the coreJsFiles array in Gruntfile.js before applying the grunt task. Contributing You can contribute by submitting issues tickets and proposing pull requests. Make sure that tests and linting pass before submitting any pull request by running the command grunt. The whole source code is validated by the Google Closure Linter and JSHint, and the comments are written in JSDoc (tags description is available here).

Rather than trying to be an all-encompassing framework, arbor provides an efficient, force-directed layout algorithm plus abstractions for graph organization and screen refresh handling.  It leaves the actual screen-drawing to you. This means you can use it with canvas, SVG, or even positioned HTML elements; whatever display approach is appropriate for your project and your performance needs.  As a result, the code you write with it can be focused on the things that make your project unique – the graph data and your visual style – rather than spending time on the physics math that makes the layouts possible.  Installation ------------  To use the particle system, add jquery and the file at lib/arbor.js to your path somewhere and include them in your html:    <script src=""path/to/jquery.min.js""></script>   <script src=""path/to/arbor.js""></script>    If you want to let arbor handle realtime color and value tweens for you, include the arbor-tween.js file as well. This will add a pair of new tweening methods to the ParticleSystem object (see the docs to decide if this appeals to you or not).    <script src=""path/to/jquery.min.js""></script>   <script src=""path/to/arbor.js""></script>   <script src=""path/to/arbor-tween.js""></script>   Getting Started ---------------  The docs folder contains a sample project that demonstrates some of the basic idioms for working with the library to build a visualization. More detailed documentation can be found at http://arborjs.org/reference.  In addition, the demos folder contains standalone versions of the demos at arborjs.org. But since all of them use xhr to fetch their data, you'll  still need to view them from an http server. If you don't have a copy of apache handy, use the demo-server.sh script to create a local server.  Colophon --------  Arbor’s design is heavily influenced by Jeffrey Bernstein’s excellent Traer Physics[1] library for Processing. In addition, much of the physics code has been adapted from Dennis Hotson’s springy.js[2]. The Barnes-Hut n-body implementation is based on Tom Ventimiglia and Kevin  Wayne’s vivid description[3] of the algorithm.  Thanks to all for releasing such elegantly simple and comprehensible code.  [1] <http://murderandcreate.com/physics/> [2] <https://github.com/dhotson/springy> [3] <http://arborjs.org/docs/barnes-hut>  Contribute ----------  Code submissions are greatly appreciated and highly encouraged. Please send pull requests with fixes/enhancements/etc. to samizdatco on github. The  oldschool may also pipe their diff -u output to info@arborjs.org.

Processing itself is hosted over at https://github.com/processing/processing. This is also not where to file bugs or ask questions about the ""JS mode"" that can be used with Processing, that project is hosted over at https://github.com/fjenett/javascript-mode-processing Versioning Processing.js adheres to semver style versioning, with the current version being 1.6.0 (released July 9th, 2016) This project is currently in need of developers There is currently no one working on, or maintaining, this codebase on a regular basis, so if you think you'd like to contribute to Processing.js, to bring it back in line with Processing's current API, and take advantage of the various APIs that have become available in browsers since Processing.js slowed down, we'd love to hear from you! File an issue to say that you'd like to help out, and we can find some good places for you to get started. Getting Processing.js Bower install bower install Processing.js NPM install npm install processing-js Getting Processing.js the plain way Simply grab the processing.js or processing.min.js files, include them as script on your webpage, and you're all set. See test.html for a simple example of using Processing.js on your pages. Playing with the code Clone this project using git, and ensure you have node.js installed. After cloning, install the require node packages using npm install in the processing-js directory. Modifying the code and building your own processing.js and processing.min.js files is then a fairly straight forward process. Modify the code as much as you want or need, then: Lint: $> grunt Test: $> node test If step 1 gives you a ""grunt: command not found"" or similar error, run npm install -g grunt-cli to make sure grunt is globally installed as CLI command. If step 1 does not throw any errors, step 2 will run the Processing object through a battery of tests. Once the browser reference tests start, your processing.js and processing.min.js have been successfully built. The test script also accepts the following optional arguments: --test=testfile.pde runs one specific test --nobuild does not build Pjs if all tests pass --failonerror terminates the run if any error occurs. --noref will not start a server process and a browser for doing ref testing. --noautoref will start a server and a browser for ref testing, but doesn't auto-start the tests. Manual operations You can also perform the post-unit-test steps manually: Build processing.js: $> browserify build.js -o processing.js Minify processing.js: $> node minify Run test server: $> node server While the browser tests run With the test server is running, the following urls are good to know: http://localhost:3000 - vanilla example page http://localhost:3000/ref - reference testing page http://localhost:3000/perf - performance testing page http://localhost:3000/processing-helper.html - utility page for converting/running Processing code Contributing to Processing.js Please read ""how to contribute to Processing.js"" for how you can contribute, and what code of conduct is expected to be followed.

It uses: underscore.js bean bonzo Flotr2 Usage To use Envision.js, include envision.min.js and envision.min.css in your page. To display a visualization, either use a Template or create a custom visualization with the Envision.js API. Templates Templates are pre-built visualizations for common use-cases. Example:   var     container = document.getElementById('container'),     x = [],     y1 = [],     y2 = [],     data, options, i;    // Data Format:   data = [     [x, y1], // First Series     [x, y2]  // Second Series   ];    // Sample the sine function for data   for (i = 0; i < 4 * Math.PI; i += 0.05) {     x.push(i);     y1.push(Math.sin(i));     y2.push(Math.sin(i + Math.PI));   }    // TimeSeries Template Options   options = {     // Container to render inside of     container : container,     // Data for detail (top chart) and summary (bottom chart)     data : {       detail : data,       summary : data     }   };    // Create the TimeSeries   new envision.templates.TimeSeries(options); Custom Developers can use the envision APIs to build custom visualizations. The existing templates are a good reference for this. Example:   var     container = document.getElementById('container'),     x = [],     y1 = [],     y2 = [],     data, i,     detail, detailOptions,     summary, summaryOptions,     vis, selection,    // Data Format:   data = [     [x, y1], // First Series     [x, y2]  // Second Series   ];    // Sample the sine function for data   for (i = 0; i < 4 * Math.PI; i += 0.05) {     x.push(i);     y1.push(Math.sin(i));     y2.push(Math.sin(i + Math.PI));   }   x.push(4 * Math.PI)   y1.push(Math.sin(4 * Math.PI));   y2.push(Math.sin(4 * Math.PI));    // Configuration for detail:   detailOptions = {     name : 'detail',     data : data,     height : 150,     flotr : {       yaxis : {         min : -1.1,         max : 1.1       }     }   };    // Configuration for summary:   summaryOptions = {     name : 'summary',     data : data,     height : 150,     flotr : {       yaxis : {         min : -1.1,         max : 1.1       },       selection : {         mode : 'x'       }     }   };    // Building a custom vis:   vis = new envision.Visualization();   detail = new envision.Component(detailOptions);   summary = new envision.Component(summaryOptions);   interaction = new envision.Interaction();    // Render Visualization   vis     .add(detail)     .add(summary)     .render(container);    // Wireup Interaction   interaction     .leader(summary)     .follower(detail)     .add(envision.actions.selection); API Class envision.Component Defines a visualization component. Components are the building blocks of a visualization, representing one typically graphical piece of the vis. This class manages the options, DOM and API construction for an adapter which handles the actual drawing of the visualization piece. Adapters can take the form of an actual object, a constructor function or a function returning an object. Only one of these will be used. If none is submitted, the default adapter Flotr2 is used. Configuration: An object is submitted to the constructor for configuration. name A name for the component. element A container element for the component. height An explicit component height. width An explicit component width. data An array of data. Data may be formatted for envision or for the adapter itself, in which case skipPreprocess will also need to be submitted. skipPreprocess Skip data preprocessing. This is useful when using the native data format for an adapter. adapter An adapter object. adapterConstructor An adapter constructor to be instantiated by the component. adapterCallback An callback invoked by the component returning an adapter. config Configuration for the adapter. Methods: render ([element]) Render the component. If no element is submitted, the component will render in the element configured in the constructor. draw ([data], [options]) Draw the component. trigger () Trigger an event on the component's API. Arguments are passed through to the API. attach () Attach to an event on the component's API. Arguments are passed through to the API. detach () Detach a listener from an event on the component's API. Arguments are passed through to the API. destroy () Destroy the component. Empties the container and calls the destroy method on the component's API. Class envision.Visualization Defines a visualization of componenents. This class manages the rendering of a visualization. It provides convenience methods for adding, removing, and reordered components dynamically as well as convenience methods for working with a logical group of components. Configuration: An object is submitted to the constructor for configuration. name A name for the visualization. element A container element for the visualization. Methods: render ([element]) Render the visualization. If no element is submitted, the visualization will render in the element configured in the constructor. This method is chainable. add (component) Add a component to the visualization. If the visualization has already been rendered, it will render the new component. This method is chainable. remove () Remove a component from the visualization. This removes the components from the list of components in the visualization and removes its container from the DOM. It does not destroy the component. This method is chainable. setPosition (component, newIndex) Reorders a component. This method is chainable. indexOf (component) Gets the position of a component. getComponent (component) Gets the component at a position. isFirst (component) Gets whether or not the component is the first component in the visualization. isLast (component) Gets whether or not the component is the last component in the visualization. destroy () Destroys the visualization. This empties the container and destroys all the components which are part of the visualization. Class envision.Preprocessor Data preprocessor. Data can be preprocessed before it is rendered by an adapter. This has several important performance considerations. If data will be rendered repeatedly or on slower browsers, it will be faster after being optimized. First, data outside the boundaries does not need to be rendered. Second, the resolution of the data only needs to be at most the number of pixels in the width of the visualization. Performing these optimizations will limit memory overhead, important for garbage collection and performance on old browsers, as well as drawing overhead, important for mobile devices, old browsers and large data sets. Configuration: An object is submitted to the constructor for configuration. data The data for processing. Methods: getData () Returns data. setData () Set the data object. length () Returns the length of the data set. bound (min, max) Bounds the data set at within a range. subsampleMinMax (resolution) Subsample data using MinMax. MinMax will display the extrema of the subsample intervals. This is slower than regular interval subsampling but necessary for data that is very non-homogenous. subsample (resolution) Subsample data at a regular interval for resolution. This is the fastest subsampling and good for monotonic data and fairly homogenous data (not a lot of up and down). Class envision.Interaction Defines an interaction between components. This class defines interactions in which actions are triggered by leader components and reacted to by follower components. These actions are defined as configurable mappings of trigger events and event consumers. It is up to the adapter to implement the triggers and consumers. A component may be both a leader and a follower. A leader which is a follower will react to actions triggered by other leaders, but will safely not react to its own. This allows for groups of components to perform a common action. Optionally, actions may be supplied with a callback executed before the action is consumed. This allows for quick custom functionality to be added and is how advanced data management (ie. live Ajax data) may be implemented. This class follow an observer mediator pattern. Configuration: An object is submitted to the constructor for configuration. leader Component(s) to lead the interaction Methods: leader (component) Add a component as an interaction leader. follower (component) Add a component as an interaction leader. group (components) Adds an array of components as both followers and leaders. add (action, [options]) Adds an action to the interaction. The action may be optionally configured with the options argument. Currently the accepts a callback member, invoked after an action is triggered and before it is consumed by followers. Development This project uses smoosh to build and jasmine with js-imagediff to test. Tests may be executed by jasmine-headless-webkit with cd spec; jasmine-headless-webkit -j jasmine.yml -c or by a browser by navigating to spec/SpecRunner.html.

Here's the gist: var graph = new Rickshaw.Graph( {   element: document.querySelector('#graph'),   series: [     {       color: 'steelblue',       data: [ { x: 0, y: 23}, { x: 1, y: 15 }, { x: 2, y: 79 } ]     }, {       color: 'lightblue',       data: [ { x: 0, y: 30}, { x: 1, y: 20 }, { x: 2, y: 64 } ]     }   ] } );  graph.render(); See the overview, tutorial, and examples for more. Rickshaw.Graph A Rickshaw graph. Send an element reference, series data, and optionally other properties to the constructor before calling render() to point the graph. A listing of properties follows. Send these as arguments to the constructor, and optionally set them later on already-instantiated graphs with a call to configure() element A reference to an HTML element that should hold the graph. series Array of objects containing series data to plot. Each object should contain data at a minimum, a sorted array of objects each with x and y properties. Optionally send a name and color as well. Some renderers and extensions may also support additional keys. renderer A string containing the name of the renderer to be used. Options include area, stack, bar, line, and scatterplot. Also see the multi meta renderer in order to support different renderers per series. width Width of the graph in pixels. Falls back to the width of the element, or defaults to 400 if the element has no width. height Height of the graph in pixels. Falls back to the height of the element, or defaults to 250 if the element has no height. min Lower value on the Y-axis, or auto for the lowest value in the series. Defaults to 0. max Highest value on the Y-axis. Defaults to the highest value in the series. padding An object containing any of top, right, bottom, and left properties specifying a padding percentage around the extrema of the data in the graph. Defaults to 0.01 on top for 1% padding, and 0 on other sides. Padding on the bottom only applies when the yMin is either negative or auto. interpolation Line smoothing / interpolation method (see D3 docs); notable options: linear: straight lines between points step-after: square steps from point to point cardinal: smooth curves via cardinal splines (default) basis: smooth curves via B-splines stack Allows you to specify whether series should be stacked while in the context of stacking renderers (area, bar, etc). Defaults to stack: 'true'. To unstack, unstack: 'true'. Methods Once you have instantiated a graph, call methods below to get pixels on the screen, change configuration, and set callbacks. render() Draw or redraw the graph. configure() Set properties on an instantiated graph. Specify any properties the constructor accepts, including width and height and renderer. Call render() to redraw the graph and reflect newly-configured properties. onUpdate(f) Add a callback to run when the graph is rendered Extensions Once you have a basic graph, extensions let you add functionality. See the overview and examples listing for more. Rickshaw.Graph.Legend - add a basic legend Rickshaw.Graph.HoverDetail - show details on hover Rickshaw.Graph.JSONP - get data via a JSONP request Rickshaw.Graph.Annotate - add x-axis annotations Rickshaw.Graph.RangeSlider - dynamically zoom on the x-axis with a slider Rickshaw.Graph.RangeSlider.Preview - pan and zoom via graphical preview of entire data set Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.Time - add an x-axis and grid lines with time labels Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.X - add an x-axis and grid lines with arbitrary labels Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.Y - add a y-axis and grid lines Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.Y.Scaled - add a y-axis with an alternate scale Rickshaw.Graph.Behavior.Series.Highlight - highlight series on legend hover Rickshaw.Graph.Behavior.Series.Order - reorder series in the stack with drag-and-drop Rickshaw.Graph.Behavior.Series.Toggle - toggle series on and off through the legend Rickshaw.Color.Palette Rickshaw comes with a few color schemes. Instantiate a palette and specify a scheme name, and then call color() on the palette to get each next color. var palette = new Rickshaw.Color.Palette( { scheme: 'spectrum2001' } );  palette.color() // => first color in the palette palette.color() // => next color in the palette... Optionally, to palette.color() can take a numeric argument to specify which color from the palette should be used (zero-indexed). This can be helpful when assigning a color to series of a plot with particular meaning: var palette = new Rickshaw.Color.Palette( { scheme: 'colorwheel' } );  palette.color(0) // => first color in the palette - red in this example palette.color(2) // => third color in the palette - light blue Color Schemes classic9 colorwheel cool munin spectrum14 spectrum2000 spectrum2001 Interpolation For graphs with more series than palettes have colors, specify an interpolatedStopCount to the palette constructor. Rickshaw and Cross-Browser Support This library works in modern browsers and Internet Explorer 9+. Rickshaw relies on the HTMLElement#classList API, which isn't natively supported in Internet Explorer 9. Rickshaw adds support by including a shim which implements the classList API by extending the HTMLElement prototype. You can disable this behavior if you like, by setting RICKSHAW_NO_COMPAT to a true value before including the library. Dependencies Rickshaw relies on the fantastic D3 visualization library to do lots of the heavy lifting for stacking and rendering to SVG. Some extensions require jQuery and jQuery UI, but for drawing some basic graphs you'll be okay without. Rickshaw uses jsdom to run unit tests in Node to be able to do SVG manipulation. As of the jsdom 7.0.0 release, jsdom requires Node.js 4 or newer jsdom changelog. If you want to run the tests on your machine, and you don't have access to a version of node >= 4.0, you can npm install jsdom@3 so that you can run the tests using the 3.x branch of jsdom. Building For building, we need Node and npm. Running make should get you going with any luck. After doing a build you can run the tests with the command: npm test If you'd like to do your own minification, you will need to give a hint to the minifier to leave variables named $super named $super. For example, with uglify on the command line: $ uglify-js --reserved-names ""$super"" rickshaw.js > rickshaw.min.js  Or a sample configuration with grunt-contrib-uglify: uglify: {   options: {     mangle: { except: [""$super""] }   } } Contributing Pull requests are always welcome! Please follow a few guidelines: Please don't include updated versions of rickshaw.js and rickshaw.min.js. Just changes to the source files will suffice. Add a unit test or two to cover the proposed changes Do as the Romans do and stick with existing whitespace and formatting conventions (i.e., tabs instead of spaces, etc) Consider adding a simple example under examples/ that demonstrates any new functionality Authors This library was developed by David Chester, Douglas Hunter, and Silas Sewell at Shutterstock License Copyright (C) 2011-2013 by Shutterstock Images, LLC Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the ""Software""), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Apr 21, 2014 README.md Flot About Flot is a Javascript plotting library for jQuery. Read more at the website: http://www.flotcharts.org/ Take a look at the the examples in examples/index.html; they should give a good impression of what Flot can do, and the source code of the examples is probably the fastest way to learn how to use Flot. Installation Just include the Javascript file after you've included jQuery. Generally, all browsers that support the HTML5 canvas tag are supported. For support for Internet Explorer < 9, you can use Excanvas, a canvas emulator; this is used in the examples bundled with Flot. You just include the excanvas script like this: <!--[if lte IE 8]><script language=""javascript"" type=""text/javascript"" src=""excanvas.min.js""></script><![endif]--> If it's not working on your development IE 6.0, check that it has support for VML which Excanvas is relying on. It appears that some stripped down versions used for test environments on virtual machines lack the VML support. You can also try using Flashcanvas, which uses Flash to do the emulation. Although Flash can be a bit slower to load than VML, if you've got a lot of points, the Flash version can be much faster overall. Flot contains some wrapper code for activating Excanvas which Flashcanvas is compatible with. You need at least jQuery 1.2.6, but try at least 1.3.2 for interactive charts because of performance improvements in event handling. Basic usage Create a placeholder div to put the graph in: <div id=""placeholder""></div> You need to set the width and height of this div, otherwise the plot library doesn't know how to scale the graph. You can do it inline like this: <div id=""placeholder"" style=""width:600px;height:300px""></div> You can also do it with an external stylesheet. Make sure that the placeholder isn't within something with a display:none CSS property - in that case, Flot has trouble measuring label dimensions which results in garbled looks and might have trouble measuring the placeholder dimensions which is fatal (it'll throw an exception). Then when the div is ready in the DOM, which is usually on document ready, run the plot function: $.plot($(""#placeholder""), data, options); Here, data is an array of data series and options is an object with settings if you want to customize the plot. Take a look at the examples for some ideas of what to put in or look at the API reference. Here's a quick example that'll draw a line from (0, 0) to (1, 1): $.plot($(""#placeholder""), [ [[0, 0], [1, 1]] ], { yaxis: { max: 1 } }); The plot function immediately draws the chart and then returns a plot object with a couple of methods. What's with the name? First: it's pronounced with a short o, like ""plot"". Not like ""flawed"". So ""Flot"" rhymes with ""plot"". And if you look up ""flot"" in a Danish-to-English dictionary, some of the words that come up are ""good-looking"", ""attractive"", ""stylish"", ""smart"", ""impressive"", ""extravagant"". One of the main goals with Flot is pretty looks. Notes about the examples In order to have a useful, functional example of time-series plots using time zones, date.js from timezone-js (released under the Apache 2.0 license) and the Olson time zone database (released to the public domain) have been included in the examples directory. They are used in examples/axes-time-zones/index.html. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc. Terms Privacy Security Status Help Something went wrong with that request.

It's a very simple API for drawing line, bar, area and donut charts. Cheers! - Olly (olly@oesmith.co.uk) Contributors wanted I'm unfortunately not able to actively support Morris.js any more. I keep an eye on the issues, but I rarely have the time to fix bugs or review pull requests. If you're interested in actively contributing to Morris.js, please contact me on the email address above. Requirements jQuery (>= 1.7 recommended, but it'll probably work with older versions) Raphael.js (>= 2.0) Usage See the website. Development Very daring. Fork, hack, possibly even add some tests, then send a pull request :) Remember that Morris.js is a coffeescript project. Please make your changes in the .coffee files, not in the compiled javascript files in the root directory of the project. Developer quick-start You'll need node.js. I recommend using nvm for installing node in development environments. With node installed, install grunt using npm install -g grunt-cli, and then the rest of the test/build dependencies with npm install in the morris.js project folder. Additionally, bower is required for for retrieving additional test dependencies. Install it with npm install -g bower and then bower install in the morris project folder. Once you're all set up, you can compile, minify and run the tests using grunt. Note: I'm experimenting with using perceptual diffs to catch rendering regressions. Due to font rendering differences between platforms, the pdiff tests currently only pass on OS X. Changelog 0.5.1 - 15th June 2014 Fix touch event handling.

Jul 4, 2016 README.md NVD3 - A reusable D3 charting library Inspired by the work of Mike Bostock's Towards Reusable Charts, and supported by a combined effort of Novus and the NVD3 community. View Examples | NEW Documentation! | Development build status: Usage Simply add the nv.d3 assets to your project and include them in your HTML. <link href=""nv.d3.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet""> <script src=""nv.d3.min.js""></script>  nv.d3.js should appear after d3.js is included. Prefer minified assets (.min) for production. Dependencies NVD3 is recommended to go with d3.js version 3.5.3 and later, but NOT d3 4.x yet. Minimum D3 version required: 3.4.4 Along with pieChart options padAngle and cornerRadius, the interactive guideline tooltip now requires these later versions of D3 (3.4.4+, specifically, to get interactive tooltips). The interactive guide lines rely on the more recent d3.bisector() method which treats accessors taking two parameters (the second being the element index) as comparators (see d3.bisector()). Supported Browsers NVD3 runs best on WebKit based browsers. Google Chrome: latest version Opera 15+ (i.e. webkit version) Safari: latest version Firefox: latest version Internet Explorer: 10+ Changelog 1.8.4 Changes: Community bugfixes including tooltip fixes. 1.8.3 Changes: Logs of community bugfixes Added force-directed chart 1.8.2 Changes: Lots of community bugfixes and a few extra minor features 1.8.1 Changes: Tooltips were refactored - If you have customized your tooltips, note that you may need to adjust your custom functions as the data passed has changed format. See the new tooltip options for more details. Added boxplot charts | example Added candlestick charts | example Added extra donut chart abilities | examples Added sunburst Charts | example Time Series | example Another legend format available | example Lots of bug fixes (see closed issues) (for all examples, see here) 1.7.1 Changes: Fixed axis.staggerLabels bug. Fixed Karma unit tests. Fixed chart test pages. Merged in nvd3-community changes and development branch. 1.7.0 Changes: Fixes around 20 small bugs. Fixed the notorious slowness of line charts and scatter plots on chrome Combined the scatterChart and scatterChartWithLines models Combined the linePlusBarChart and linePlusBarChartWithFocus models. renamed some of the options (see the new documentation for what options are available for each chart) Completed the migration of the option functions to an object format which allows the generation of the documentation in an automated way. Not everything has a description yet, but check it out! Added extra options to the donut charts based on features that will be in d3 3.5. The donut example page loads the latest d3 from their 3.5 branch so keep that in mind. Added an example of the parallelCoordinates chart. Fixed up the half-done OHLC bar chart, and made an example for it as well. 1.6.0 Changes: includes about a dozen bug fixes and pull requests I fixed and merged in from the issues/pulls from the original project. It also standardized all indention Current development focus Review outstanding pull requests and issues. Try to find an easy way to actually document usage and all chart options. Improve the testing framework. Setup continuous integration. Bugs Found a bug? Check out the latest from the master branch and make sure it's not already fixed first! If you don't see a related fix, please open an issue. Optional dependencies Including Fastdom in your project can greatly increase the performance of the line chart (particularly in Firefox and Internet Explorer) by batching DOM read and write operations to avoid layout thrashing. NVD3 will take advantage of Fastdom if present. Contributing If one of the existing models doesn't meet your needs, fork the project, implement the model and an example using it, send us a pull request, for consideration for inclusion in the project. If you'd like to contribute consistently, show me what you've got with some good pull requests and you may get added to the nvd3-community org! A few rules for pull requests Please commit to the master branch Do NOT check in anything under the build directory, it clutters up the commit and just gets overwritten later. All new features must come with unit test coverage Bug fixes should come with unit tests that prove their fix If you want to test your changes using the example pages, you'll have to run grunt production to build the items into the build directory. You must do this before your changes show up in the examples, as they link to the build directory in order to properly show off the finished product. Please remember to NOT include the build files in your commit though, only include the source files you changed! Tips for Testing Unit tests were written in Karma and Mocha. Follow instructions in Building Latest to get npm packages setup. This may not work on Windows machines. Run bower install to get bower dependencies. Run grunt to start the unit tests. Also visually inspect the HTML pages in the examples/ and test/ folders. Make sure there are no glaring errors. Novus now uses Travis CI for continuous integration. Visit our travis build page to see the latest status. Meteor Tinytests Any Meteor-specific features can be tested from the command line using tinytest and Spacejam spacejam can be installed by running npm install -g spacejam. Tinytests can then be executed by running spacejam test-packages ./ from this project's root. Building latest First clone the repository and checkout the master branch make sure nodejs is installed via your system's package manager. Install grunt, grunt-cli, and bower: npm install -g grunt grunt-cli bower have node download nvd3's required modules with: npm install build with: grunt production You should now have a build directory with the js and css files within.

Svg.js has no dependencies and aims to be as small as possible. Svg.js is licensed under the terms of the MIT License. Want to know more? Check the documentation. Usage Create an SVG document Use the SVG() function to create an SVG document within a given html element: var draw = SVG('drawing').size(300, 300) var rect = draw.rect(100, 100).attr({ fill: '#f06' }) The first argument can either be an id of the element or the selected element itself. This will generate the following output: <div id=""drawing"">   <svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" version=""1.1"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" width=""300"" height=""300"">     <rect width=""100"" height=""100"" fill=""#f06""></rect>   </svg> </div> By default the svg drawing follows the dimensions of its parent, in this case #drawing: var draw = SVG('drawing').size('100%', '100%') Checking for SVG support By default this library assumes the client's browser supports SVG. You can test support as follows: if (SVG.supported) {   var draw = SVG('drawing')   var rect = draw.rect(100, 100) } else {   alert('SVG not supported') } SVG document Svg.js also works outside of the HTML DOM, inside an SVG document for example: <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?> <svg id=""drawing"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" version=""1.1"" >   <script type=""text/javascript"" xlink:href=""svg.min.js""></script>   <script type=""text/javascript"">     <![CDATA[       var draw = SVG('drawing')       draw.rect(100,100).animate().fill('#f03').move(100,100)     ]]>   </script> </svg> Sub-pixel offset fix Call the spof() method to fix sub-pixel offset: var draw = SVG('drawing').spof() To enable automatic sub-pixel offset correction when the window is resized: SVG.on(window, 'resize', function() { draw.spof() }) Parent elements Main svg document The main SVG.js initializer function creates a root svg node in the given element and returns an instance of SVG.Doc: var draw = SVG('drawing') returns: SVG.Doc Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Doc < SVG.Container < SVG.Parent Nested svg With this feature you can nest svg documents within each other. Nested svg documents have exactly the same features as the main, top-level svg document: var nested = draw.nested()  var rect = nested.rect(200, 200) returns: SVG.Nested Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Nested < SVG.Container < SVG.Parent Groups Grouping elements is useful if you want to transform a set of elements as if it were one. All element within a group maintain their position relative to the group they belong to. A group has all the same element methods as the root svg document: var group = draw.group() group.path('M10,20L30,40') Existing elements from the svg document can also be added to a group: group.add(rect) Note: Groups do not have a geometry of their own, it's inherited from their content. Therefore groups do not listen to x, y, width and height attributes. If that is what you are looking for, use a nested() svg instead. returns: SVG.G Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.G < SVG.Container < SVG.Parent Hyperlink A hyperlink or <a> tag creates a container that enables a link on all children: var link = draw.link('http://svgjs.com') var rect = link.rect(100, 100) The link url can be updated with the to() method: link.to('http://apple.com') Furthermore, the link element has a show() method to create the xlink:show attribute: link.show('replace') And the target() method to create the target attribute: link.target('_blank') Elements can also be linked the other way around with the linkTo() method: rect.linkTo('http://svgjs.com') Alternatively a block can be passed instead of a url for more options on the link element: rect.linkTo(function(link) {   link.to('http://svgjs.com').target('_blank') }) returns: SVG.A Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.A < SVG.Container < SVG.Parent Defs The <defs> element is a container element for referenced elements. Elements that are descendants of a ‘defs’ are not rendered directly. The <defs> node lives in the main <svg> document and can be accessed with the defs() method: var defs = draw.defs() The defs are also available on any other element through the doc() method: var defs = rect.doc().defs() The defs node works exactly the same as groups. returns: SVG.Defs Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Defs < SVG.Container < SVG.Parent Rect Rects have two arguments, their width and height: var rect = draw.rect(100, 100) returns: SVG.Rect Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Rect < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element radius() Rects can also have rounded corners: rect.radius(10) This will set the rx and ry attributes to 10. To set rx and ry individually: rect.radius(10, 20) returns: itself Circle The only argument necessary for a circle is the diameter: var circle = draw.circle(100) returns: SVG.Circle Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Circle < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element radius() Circles can also be redefined by their radius: circle.radius(75) returns: itself Ellipse Ellipses, like rects, have two arguments, their width and height: var ellipse = draw.ellipse(200, 100) returns: SVG.Ellipse Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Ellipse < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element radius() Ellipses can also be redefined by their radii: ellipse.radius(75, 50) returns: itself Line Create a line from point A to point B: var line = draw.line(0, 0, 100, 150).stroke({ width: 1 }) Creating a line element can be done in four ways. Look at the plot() method to see all the possiblilities. returns: SVG.Line Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Line < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element plot() Updating a line is done with the plot() method: line.plot(50, 30, 100, 150) Alternatively it also accepts a point string: line.plot('0,0 100,150') Or a point array: line.plot([[0, 0], [100, 150]]) Or an instance of SVG.PointArray: var array = new SVG.PointArray([[0, 0], [100, 150]]) line.plot(array) returns: itself array() References the SVG.PointArray instance. This method is rather intended for internal use: polyline.array() returns: SVG.PointArray Polyline The polyline element defines a set of connected straight line segments. Typically, polyline elements define open shapes: // polyline('x,y x,y x,y') var polyline = draw.polyline('0,0 100,50 50,100').fill('none').stroke({ width: 1 }) Polyline strings consist of a list of points separated by spaces: x,y x,y x,y. As an alternative an array of points will work as well: // polyline([[x,y], [x,y], [x,y]]) var polyline = draw.polyline([[0,0], [100,50], [50,100]]).fill('none').stroke({ width: 1 }) returns: SVG.Polyline Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Polyline < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element plot() Polylines can be updated using the plot() method: polyline.plot([[0,0], [100,50], [50,100], [150,50], [200,50]]) The plot() method can also be animated: polyline.animate(3000).plot([[0,0], [100,50], [50,100], [150,50], [200,50], [250,100], [300,50], [350,50]]) returns: itself array() References the SVG.PointArray instance. This method is rather intended for internal use: polyline.array() returns: SVG.PointArray Polygon The polygon element, unlike the polyline element, defines a closed shape consisting of a set of connected straight line segments: // polygon('x,y x,y x,y') var polygon = draw.polygon('0,0 100,50 50,100').fill('none').stroke({ width: 1 }) Polygon strings are exactly the same as polyline strings. There is no need to close the shape as the first and last point will be connected automatically. returns: SVG.Polygon Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Polygon < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element plot() Like polylines, polygons can be updated using the plot() method: polygon.plot([[0,0], [100,50], [50,100], [150,50], [200,50]]) The plot() method can also be animated: polygon.animate(3000).plot([[0,0], [100,50], [50,100], [150,50], [200,50], [250,100], [300,50], [350,50]]) returns: itself array() References the SVG.PointArray instance. This method is rather intended for internal use: polygon.array() returns: SVG.PointArray Path The path string is similar to the polygon string but much more complex in order to support curves: draw.path('M 100 200 C 200 100 300  0 400 100 C 500 200 600 300 700 200 C 800 100 900 100 900 100') returns: SVG.Path Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Path < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element For more details on path data strings, please refer to the SVG documentation: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData plot() Paths can be updated using the plot() method: path.plot('M100,200L300,400') returns: itself array() References the SVG.PathArray instance. This method is rather intended for internal use: path.array() returns: SVG.PathArray Image Creating images is as you might expect: var image = draw.image('/path/to/image.jpg') If you know the size of the image, those parameters can be passed as the second and third arguments: var image = draw.image('/path/to/image.jpg', 200, 300) returns: SVG.Image Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Image < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element load() Loading another image can be done with the load() method: image.load('/path/to/another/image.jpg') returns: itself loaded() If you don't know the size of the image, obviously you will have to wait for the image to be loaded: var image = draw.image('/path/to/image.jpg').loaded(function(loader) {   this.size(loader.width, loader.height) }) The returned loader object as first the argument of the loaded method contains four values: width height ratio (width / height) url returns: itself Text Unlike html, text in svg is much harder to tame. There is no way to create flowing text, so newlines should be entered manually. In SVG.js there are two ways to create text elements. The first and easiest method is to provide a string of text, split by newlines: var text = draw.text(""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.\nCras sodales imperdiet auctor."") This will automatically create a block of text and insert newlines where necessary. The second method will give you much more control but requires a bit more code: var text = draw.text(function(add) {   add.tspan('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ').newLine()   add.tspan('consectetur').fill('#f06')   add.tspan('.')   add.tspan('Cras sodales imperdiet auctor.').newLine().dx(20)   add.tspan('Nunc ultrices lectus at erat').newLine()   add.tspan('dictum pharetra elementum ante').newLine() }) If you want to go the other way and don't want to add tspans at all, just one line of text, you can use the plain() method instead: var text = draw.plain('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.') This is a shortcut to the plain method on the SVG.Text instance which doesn't render newlines at all. Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Text < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element returns: SVG.Text text() Changing text afterwards is also possible with the text() method: text.text('Brilliant!') returns: itself To get the raw text content: text.text() returns: string tspan() Just adding one tspan is also possible: text.tspan(' on a train...').fill('#f06') returns: SVG.Tspan plain() If the content of the element doesn't need any stying or multiple lines, it might be sufficient to just add some plain text: text.plain('I do not have any expectations.') returns: itself font() The sugar.js module provides some syntax sugar specifically for this element type: text.font({   family:   'Helvetica' , size:     144 , anchor:   'middle' , leading:  '1.5em' }) returns: itself leading() As opposed to html, where leading is defined by line-height, svg does not have a natural leading equivalent. In svg, lines are not defined naturally. They are defined by <tspan> nodes with a dy attribute defining the line height and a x value resetting the line to the x position of the parent text element. But you can also have many nodes in one line defining a different y, dy, x or even dx value. This gives us a lot of freedom, but also a lot more responsibility. We have to decide when a new line is defined, where it starts, what its offset is and what it's height is. The leading() method in SVG.js tries to ease the pain by giving you behaviour that is much closer to html. In combination with newline separated text, it works just like html: var text = draw.text(""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.\nCras sodales imperdiet auctor."") text.leading(1.3) This will render a text element with a tspan element for each line, with a dy value of 130% of the font size. Note that the leading() method assumes that every first level tspan in a text node represents a new line. Using leading() on text elements containing multiple tspans in one line (e.g. without a wrapping tspan defining a new line) will render scrambeled. So it is advisable to use this method with care, preferably only when throwing newline separated text at the text element or calling the newLine() method on every first level tspan added in the block passed as argument to the text element. returns: itself build() The build() can be used to enable / disable build mode. With build mode disabled, the plain() and tspan() methods will first call the clear() bethod before adding the new content. So when build mode is enabled, plain() and tspan() will append the new content to the existing content. When passing a block to the text() method, build mode is toggled automatically before and after the block is called. But in some cases it might be useful to be able to toggle it manually: var text = draw.text('This is just the start, ')  text.build(true)  // enables build mode  var tspan = text.tspan('something pink in the middle ').fill('#00ff97') text.plain('and again boring at the end.')  text.build(false) // disables build mode  tspan.animate('2s').fill('#f06') returns: itself rebuild() This is an internal callback that probably never needs to be called manually. Basically it rebuilds the text element whenerver font-size and x attributes or the leading() of the text element are modified. This method also acts a setter to enable or disable rebuilding: text.rebuild(false) //-> disables rebuilding text.rebuild(true)  //-> enables rebuilding and instantaneously rebuilds the text element returns: itself clear() Clear all the contents of the called text element: text.clear() returns: itself length() Gets the total computed text length of all tspans together: text.length() returns: number lines() All first level tspans can be referenced with the lines() method: text.lines() This will return an intance of SVG.Set including all tspan elements. returns: SVG.Set events The text element has one event. It is fired every time the rebuild() method is called: text.on('rebuild', function() {   // whatever you need to do after rebuilding }) Tspan The tspan elements are only available inside text elements or inside other tspan elements. In SVG.js they have a class of their own: Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Tspan < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element text() Update the content of the tspan. This can be done by either passing a string: tspan.text('Just a string.') Which will basicly call the plain() method. Or by passing a block to add more specific content inside the called tspan: tspan.text(function(add) {   add.plain('Just plain text.')   add.tspan('Fancy text wrapped in a tspan.').fill('#f06')   add.tspan(function(addMore) {     addMore.tspan('And you can doo deeper and deeper...')   }) }) returns: itself tspan() Add a nested tspan: tspan.tspan('I am a child of my parent').fill('#f06') returns: SVG.Tspan plain() Just adds some plain text: tspan.plain('I do not have any expectations.') returns: itself dx() Define the dynamic x value of the element, much like a html element with position:relative and left defined: tspan.dx(30) returns: itself dy() Define the dynamic y value of the element, much like a html element with position:relative and top defined: tspan.dy(30) returns: itself newLine() The newLine() is a convenience method for adding a new line with a dy attribute using the current ""leading"": var text = draw.text(function(add) {   add.tspan('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ').newLine()   add.tspan('consectetur').fill('#f06')   add.tspan('.')   add.tspan('Cras sodales imperdiet auctor.').newLine().dx(20)   add.tspan('Nunc ultrices lectus at erat').newLine()   add.tspan('dictum pharetra elementum ante').newLine() }) returns: itself clear() Clear all the contents of the called tspan element: tspan.clear() returns: itself length() Gets the total computed text length: tspan.length() returns: number TextPath A nice feature in svg is the ability to run text along a path: var text = draw.text(function(add) {   add.tspan('We go ')   add.tspan('up').fill('#f09').dy(-40)   add.tspan(', then we go down, then up again').dy(40) }) text   .path('M 100 200 C 200 100 300 0 400 100 C 500 200 600 300 700 200 C 800 100 900 100 900 100')   .font({ size: 42.5, family: 'Verdana' }) When calling the path() method on a text element, the text element is mutated into an intermediate between a text and a path element. From that point on the text element will also feature a plot() method to update the path: text.plot('M 300 500 C 200 100 300 0 400 100 C 500 200 600 300 700 200 C 800 100 900 100 900 100') Attributes specific to the <textPath> element can be applied to the textPath instance itself: text.textPath().attr('startOffset', 0.5) And they can be animated as well of course: text.textPath().animate(3000).attr('startOffset', 0.8) returns: SVG.TextPath Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.TextPath < SVG.Element textPath() Referencing the textPath node directly: var textPath = text.textPath() returns: SVG.TextPath track() Referencing the linked path element directly: var path = text.track() returns: SVG.Path Use The use element simply emulates another existing element. Any changes on the master element will be reflected on all the use instances. The usage of use() is very straightforward: var rect = draw.rect(100, 100).fill('#f09') var use  = draw.use(rect).move(200, 200) In the case of the example above two rects will appear on the svg drawing, the original and the use instance. In some cases you might want to hide the original element. the best way to do this is to create the original element in the defs node: var rect = draw.defs().rect(100, 100).fill('#f09') var use  = draw.use(rect).move(200, 200) In this way the rect element acts as a library element. You can edit it but it won't be rendered. Another way is to point an external SVG file, just specified the element id and path to file. var use  = draw.use('elementId', 'path/to/file.svg') This way is usefull when you have complex images already created. Note that, for external images (outside your domain) it may be necessary to load the file with XHR. returns: SVG.Use Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Use < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element Symbol Not unlike the group element, the symbol element is a container element. The only difference between symbols and groups is that symbols are not rendered. Therefore a symbol element is ideal in combination with the use element: var symbol = draw.symbol() symbol.rect(100, 100).fill('#f09')  var use  = draw.use(symbol).move(200, 200) returns: SVG.Bare Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.Bare < SVG.Element [with a shallow inheritance from SVG.Parent] Bare For all SVG elements that are not described by SVG.js, the SVG.Bare class comes in handy. This class inherits directly from SVG.Element and makes it possible to add custom methods in a separate namespace without polluting the main SVG.Element namespace. Consider it your personal playground. element() The SVG.Bare class can be instantiated with the element() method on any parent element: var element = draw.element('title') The string value passed as the first argument is the node name that should be generated. Additionally any existing class name can be passed as the second argument to define from which class the element should inherit: var element = draw.element('symbol', SVG.Parent) This gives you as the user a lot of power. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. returns: SVG.Bare words() The SVG.Bare instance carries an additional method to add plain text: var element = draw.element('title').words('This is a title.') //-> <title>This is a title.</title> returns: itself Referencing elements By id If you want to get an element created by SVG.js by its id, you can use the SVG.get() method: var element = SVG.get('my_element')  element.fill('#f06') Using CSS selectors There are two ways to select elements using CSS selectors. The first is to search globally. This will search in all svg elements in a document and return them in an instance of SVG.Set: var elements = SVG.select('rect.my-class').fill('#f06') The second is to search within a parent element: var elements = group.select('rect.my-class').fill('#f06') Using jQuery or Zepto Another way is to use jQuery or Zepto. Here is an example: // add elements var draw   = SVG('drawing') var group  = draw.group().addClass('my-group') var rect   = group.rect(100,100).addClass('my-element') var circle = group.circle(100).addClass('my-element').move(100, 100)  // get elements in group var elements = $('#drawing g.my-group .my-element').each(function() {   this.instance.animate().fill('#f09') }) Circular reference Every element instance within SVG.js has a reference to the actual node: node element.node returns: node native() The same can be achieved with the native() method: element.native() returns: node instance Similar, the node carries a reference to the SVG.js instance: node.instance returns: element Parent reference Every element has a reference to its parent with the parent() method: parent() element.parent() returns: element Alternatively a class or css selector can be passed as the first argument: var draw   = SVG('drawing') var nested = draw.nested().addClass('test') var group  = nested.group() var rect   = group.rect(100, 100)  rect.parent()           //-> returns group rect.parent(SVG.Doc)    //-> returns draw rect.parent(SVG.Nested) //-> returns nested rect.parent(SVG.G)      //-> returns group rect.parent('.test')    //-> returns nested returns: element Even the main svg document: var draw = SVG('drawing')  draw.parent() //-> returns the wrappig html element with id 'drawing' returns: HTMLNode doc() For retrieving the root svg you can use doc() var draw = SVG('drawing') var rect = draw.rect(100, 100)  rect.doc() //-> returns draw parents() To get all ancestors of the element filtered by type or css selector (see parent() method) var group1 = draw.group().addClass('test')   , group2 = group1.group()   , rect   = group2.rect(100,100)  rect.parents()        // returns [group1, group2, draw] rect.parents('.test') // returns [group1] rect.parents(SVG.G)   // returns [group1, group2] returns: Array Child references first() To get the first child of a parent element: draw.first() returns: element last() To get the last child of a parent element: draw.last() returns: element children() An array of all children will can be retreives with the children method: draw.children() returns: array each() The each() allows you to iterate over the all children of a parent element: draw.each(function(i, children) {   this.fill({ color: '#f06' }) }) Deep traversing is also possible by passing true as the second argument: // draw.each(block, deep) draw.each(function(i, children) {   this.fill({ color: '#f06' }) }, true) Note that this refers to the current child element. returns: itself has() Checking the existence of an element within a parent: var rect  = draw.rect(100, 50) var group = draw.group()  draw.has(rect)  //-> returns true group.has(rect) //-> returns false returns: boolean index() Returns the index of given element and returns -1 when it is not a child: var rect  = draw.rect(100, 50) var group = draw.group()  draw.index(rect)  //-> returns 0 group.index(rect) //-> returns -1 returns: number get() Get an element on a given position in the children array: var rect   = draw.rect(20, 30) var circle = draw.circle(50)  draw.get(0) //-> returns rect draw.get(1) //-> returns circle returns: element clear() To remove all elements from a parent element: draw.clear() returns: itself Import / export SVG svg() Exporting the full generated SVG, or a part of it, can be done with the svg() method: draw.svg() Exporting works on all elements. Importing is done with the same method: draw.svg('<g><rect width=""100"" height=""50"" fill=""#f06""></rect></g>') Importing works on any element that inherits from SVG.Parent, which is basically every element that can contain other elements. getterreturns: string setterreturns: itself Attributes and styles attr() You can get and set an element's attributes directly using attr(). Get a single attribute: rect.attr('x') Set a single attribute: rect.attr('x', 50) Set multiple attributes at once: rect.attr({   fill: '#f06' , 'fill-opacity': 0.5 , stroke: '#000' , 'stroke-width': 10 }) Set an attribute with a namespace: rect.attr('x', 50, 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg') Explicitly remove an attribute: rect.attr('fill', null) getterreturns: value setterreturns: itself style() With the style() method the style attribute can be managed like attributes with attr: rect.style('cursor', 'pointer') Multiple styles can be set at once using an object: rect.style({ cursor: 'pointer', fill: '#f03' }) Or a css string: rect.style('cursor:pointer;fill:#f03;') Similar to attr() the style() method can also act as a getter: rect.style('cursor') // => pointer Or even a full getter: rect.style() // => 'cursor:pointer;fill:#f03;' Explicitly deleting individual style definitions works the same as with the attr() method: rect.style('cursor', null) getterreturns: value setterreturns: itself fill() The fill() method is a pretty alternative to the attr() method: rect.fill({ color: '#f06', opacity: 0.6 }) A single hex string will work as well: rect.fill('#f06') Last but not least, you can also use an image as fill, simply by passing an image url: rect.fill('images/shade.jpg') Or if you want more control over the size of the image, you can pass an image instance as well: rect.fill(draw.image('images/shade.jpg', 20, 20)) returns: itself stroke() The stroke() method is similar to fill(): rect.stroke({ color: '#f06', opacity: 0.6, width: 5 }) Like fill, a single hex string will work as well: rect.stroke('#f06') Not unlike the fill() method, you can also use an image as stroke, simply by passing an image url: rect.stroke('images/shade.jpg') Or if you want more control over the size of the image, you can pass an image instance as well: rect.stroke(draw.image('images/shade.jpg', 20, 20)) returns: itself opacity() To set the overall opacity of an element: rect.opacity(0.5) returns: itself reference() In cases where an element is linked to another element through an attribute, the linked element instance can be fetched with the reference() method. The only thing required is the attribute name: use.reference('href') //-> returns used element instance // or rect.reference('fill') //-> returns gradient or pattern instance for example // or circle.reference('clip-path') //-> returns clip instance hide() Hide element: rect.hide() returns: itself show() Show element: rect.show() returns: itself visible() To check if the element is visible: rect.visible() returns: boolean Classes classes() Fetches the css classes for the node as an array: rect.classes() getterreturns: array hasClass() Test the presence of a given css class: rect.hasClass('purple-rain') getterreturns: boolean addClass() Adds a given css class: rect.addClass('pink-flower') setterreturns: itself removeClass() Removes a given css class: rect.removeClass('pink-flower') setterreturns: itself toggleClass() Toggles a given css class: rect.toggleClass('pink-flower') setterreturns: itself Size and position While positioning an element by directly setting its attributes works only if the attributes are used natively by that type of element, the positioning methods described below are much more convenient as they work for all element types. For example, the following code works because each element is positioned by setting native attributes: rect.attr({ x: 20, y: 60 }) circle.attr({ cx: 50, cy: 40 }) The rect will be moved by its upper left corner to the new coordinates, and the circle will be moved by its center. However, trying to move a circle by its 'corner' or a rect by its center in this way will fail. The following lines will get silently ignored as the attributes that are addressed are not natively used by the element setting them: rect.attr({ cx: 20, cy: 60 }) circle.attr({ x: 50, y: 40 }) However, the positioning methods detailed below will work for all element types, regardless of whether the attributes being addressed are native to the type. So, unlike the lines above, these lines work just fine: rect.cx(20).cy(60) circle.x(50).y(40) It is important to note, though, that these methods are only intended for use with user (unitless) coordinates. If, for example, an element has its size set via percentages or other units, the positioning methods that address its native attributes will most likely still work, but the ones that address non-native attributes will give unexpected results -- as both getters and setters! size() Set the size of an element to a given width and height: rect.size(200, 300) Proportional resizing is also possible by leaving out height: rect.size(200) Or by passing null as the value for width: rect.size(null, 200) As with positioning, the size of an element could be set by using attr(). But because every type of element is handles its size differently the size() method is much more convenient. There is one exception though: for SVG.Text elements, this method takes only one argument and applies the given value to the font-size attribute. returns: itself width() Set the width of an element: rect.width(200) This method also acts as a getter: rect.width() //-> returns 200 getterreturns: value setterreturns: itself height() Set the height of an element: rect.height(325) This method also acts as a getter: rect.height() //-> returns 325 getterreturns: value setterreturns: itself radius() Circles, ellipses, and rects may use the radius() method. On rects, it defines rounded corners. For a circle, the argument sets the r attribute. circle.radius(10) For ellipses and rects, pass two arguments to set the rx and ry attributes individually. Or, pass a single argument, to make the two attributes equal. ellipse.radius(10, 20) rect.radius(5) This functionality requires the sugar.js module which is included in the default distribution. returns: itself move() Move the element by its upper left corner to a given x and y position: rect.move(200, 350) returns: itself x() Move the element by its upper left corner along the x-axis only: rect.x(200) Without an argument the x() method serves as a getter as well: rect.x() //-> returns 200 getterreturns: value setterreturns: itself y() Move the element by its upper left corner along the y-axis only: rect.y(350) Without an argument the y() method serves as a getter as well: rect.y() //-> returns 350 getterreturns: value setterreturns: itself center() Move the element by its center to a given cx and cy position: rect.center(150, 150) returns: itself cx() Move the element by its center in the x direction only: rect.cx(200) Without an argument the cx() method serves as a getter as well: rect.cx() //-> returns 200 getterreturns: value setterreturns: itself cy() Move the element by its center in the y direction only: rect.cy(350) Without an argument the cy() method serves as a getter as well: rect.cy() //-> returns 350 getterreturns: value setterreturns: itself dmove() Shift the element in both the x and y directions relative to its current position: rect.dmove(10, 30) returns: itself dx() Shift the element in the x direction relative to its current position: rect.dx(200) returns: itself dy() Shift the element in the y direction relative to its current position: rect.dy(200) returns: itself Document tree manipulations clone() To make an exact copy of an element the clone() method comes in handy: var clone = rect.clone() returns: element This will create a new, unlinked copy. For making a linked clone, see the use element. By default the cloned element is placed directly after the orginal element. When you pass a parent parameter to the clone() function it will append the cloned element to the given parent. remove() Removes the calling element from the svg document: rect.remove() returns: itself replace() At the calling element's position in the svg document, replace the calling element with the element passed to the method. rect.replace(draw.circle(100)) returns: element add() Sets the calling element as the parent node of the argument. Returns the parent: var rect = draw.rect(100, 100) var group = draw.group()  group.add(rect) //-> returns group returns: itself put() Sets the calling element as the parent node of the argument. Returns the child: group.put(rect) //-> returns rect returns: element addTo() Sets the calling element as a child node of the argument. Returns the child: rect.addTo(group) //-> returns rect returns: itself putIn() Sets the calling element as a child node of the argument. Returns the parent: rect.putIn(group) //-> returns group returns: element toParent() Moves an element to a different parent (similar to addTo), but without changing its visual representation. All transformations are merged and applied to the element. rect.toParent(group) // looks the same as before returns: itself toDoc() Same as toParent() but with the root-node as parent returns: itself ungroup() / flatten() Break up a group/container and move all the elements to a given parent node without changing their visual representations. The result is a flat svg structure, e.g. for exporting. // ungroups all elements in this group recursively and places them into the given parent // (default: parent container of the calling element) group.ungroup(parent, depth)  // call it on the whole document to get a flat svg structure drawing.ungroup()  // breaks up the group and places all elements in drawing group.ungroup(drawing)  // breaks up all groups until it reaches a depth of 3 drawing.ungroup(null, 3)  // flat and export svg var svgString = drawing.ungroup().svg() returns: itself Transforms transform() The transform() method acts as a full getter without an argument: element.transform() The returned object contains the following values: x (translation on the x-axis) y (translation on the y-axis) skewX (calculated skew on x-axis) skewY (calculated skew on y-axis) scaleX (calculated scale on x-axis) scaleY (calculated scale on y-axis) rotation (calculated rotation) cx (last used rotation centre on x-axis) cy (last used rotation centre on y-axis) Additionally a string value for the required property can be passed: element.transform('rotation') In this case the returned value is a number. As a setter it has two ways of working. By default transformations are absolute. For example, if you call: element.transform({ rotation: 125 }).transform({ rotation: 37.5 }) The resulting rotation will be 37.5 and not the sum of the two transformations. But if that's what you want there is a way out by adding the relative parameter. That would be: element.transform({ rotation: 125 }).transform({ rotation: 37.5, relative: true }) Alternatively a relative flag can be passed as the second argument: element.transform({ rotation: 125 }).transform({ rotation: 37.5 }, true) Available transformations are: rotation with optional cx and cy scale with optional cx and cy scaleX with optional cx and cy scaleY with optional cx and cy skewX with optional cx and cy skewY with optional cx and cy x y a, b, c, d, e and/or f or an existing matrix instead of the object getterreturns: value setterreturns: itself rotate() The rotate() method will automatically rotate elements according to the center of the element: // rotate(degrees) rect.rotate(45) Although you can also define a specific rotation point: // rotate(degrees, cx, cy) rect.rotate(45, 50, 50) returns: itself skew() The skew() method will take an x and y value: // skew(x, y) rect.skew(0, 45) returns: itself scale() The scale() method will take an x and y value: // scale(x, y) rect.scale(0.5, -1) returns: itself translate() The translate() method will take an x and y value: // translate(x, y) rect.translate(0.5, -1) Geometry viewbox() The viewBox attribute of an <svg> element can be managed with the viewbox() method. When supplied with four arguments it will act as a setter: draw.viewbox(0, 0, 297, 210) Alternatively you can also supply an object as the first argument: draw.viewbox({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 297, height: 210 }) Without any arguments an instance of SVG.ViewBox will be returned: var box = draw.viewbox() But the best thing about the viewbox() method is that you can get the zoom of the viewbox: var box = draw.viewbox() var zoom = box.zoom If the size of the viewbox equals the size of the svg drawing, the zoom value will be 1. getterreturns: SVG.ViewBox setterreturns: itself bbox() Get the bounding box of an element. This is a wrapper for the native getBBox() method but adds more values: path.bbox() This will return an instance of SVG.BBox containing the following values: width (value from native getBBox) height (value from native getBBox) w (shorthand for width) h (shorthand for height) x (value from native getBBox) y (value from native getBBox) cx (center x of the bounding box) cy (center y of the bounding box) x2 (lower right x of the bounding box) y2 (lower right y of the bounding box) The SVG.BBox has one other nifty little feature, enter the merge() method. With merge() two SVG.BBox instances can be merged into one new instance, basically being the bounding box of the two original bounding boxes: var box1 = draw.rect(100,100).move(50,50) var box2 = draw.rect(100,100).move(200,200) var box3 = box1.merge(box2) returns: SVG.BBox tbox() Where bbox() returns a bounding box mindless of any transformations, the tbox() method does take transformations into account. So any translation or scale will be applied to the resulting values to get closer to the actual visual representation: path.tbox() This will return an instance of SVG.TBox containing the following values: width (value from native getBBox influenced by the scaleX of the current matrix) height (value from native getBBox influenced by the scaleY of the current matrix) w (shorthand for width) h (shorthand for height) x (value from native getBBox influenced by the x of the current matrix) y (value from native getBBox influenced by the y of the current matrix) cx (center x of the bounding box) cy (center y of the bounding box) x2 (lower right x of the bounding box) y2 (lower right y of the bounding box) Note that the rotation of the element will not be added to the calculation. returns: SVG.TBox rbox() Is similar to bbox() but will give you the box around the exact visual representation of the element, taking all transformations into account. path.rbox() This will return an instance of SVG.RBox containing the following values: width (the actual visual width) height (the actual visual height) w (shorthand for width) h (shorthand for height) x (the actual visual position on the x-axis) y (the actual visual position on the y-axis) cx (center x of the bounding box) cy (center y of the bounding box) x2 (lower right x of the bounding box) y2 (lower right y of the bounding box) Important: Mozilla browsers include stroke widths where other browsers do not. Therefore the resulting box might be different in Mozilla browsers. It is very hard to modify this behavior so for the time being this is an inconvenience we have to live with. returns: SVG.RBox ctm() Retreives the current transform matrix of the element relative to the nearest viewport parent: path.ctm() returns: SVG.Matrix screenCTM() Retreives the current transform matrix of the element relative to the screen: path.screenCTM() returns: SVG.Matrix matrixify() Merges all transformations of the element into one single matrix which is returned path.matrixify() returns: SVG.Matrix point() Transforms a point from screen coordinates to the elements coordinate system // e is some mouseevent var point = path.point(e.screeX, e.screenY) // {x, y} returns: SVG.Point inside() To check if a given point is inside the bounding box of an element you can use the inside() method: var rect = draw.rect(100, 100).move(50, 50)  rect.inside(25, 30) //-> returns false rect.inside(60, 70) //-> returns true Note: the x and y positions are tested against the relative position of the element. Any offset on the parent element is not taken into account. returns: boolean length() Get the total length of a path element: var length = path.length() returns: number pointAt() Get point on a path at given length: var point = path.pointAt(105) //-> returns { x : 96.88497924804688, y : 58.062747955322266 } returns: object Animating elements Animatable method chain Note that the animate() method will not return the targeted element but an instance of SVG.FX which will take the following methods: Of course attr(): rect.animate().attr({ fill: '#f03' }) The x(), y() and move() methods: rect.animate().move(100, 100) And the cx(), cy() and center() methods: rect.animate().center(200, 200) If you include the sugar.js module, fill(), stroke(), rotate(), skew(), scale(), matrix(), opacity(), radius() will be available as well: rect.animate().rotate(45).skew(25, 0) You can also animate non-numeric unit values using the attr() method: rect.attr('x', '10%').animate().attr('x', '50%') easing All available ease types are: <>: ease in and out >: ease out <: ease in -: linear =: external control a function For the latter, here is an example of the default <> function: function(pos) { return (-Math.cos(pos * Math.PI) / 2) + 0.5 } For more easing equations, have a look at the svg.easing.js plugin. animate() Animating elements is very much the same as manipulating elements, the only difference is you have to include the animate() method: rect.animate().move(150, 150) The animate() method will take three arguments. The first is duration, the second ease and the third delay: rect.animate(2000, '>', 1000).attr({ fill: '#f03' }) Alternatively you can pass an object as the first argument: rect.animate({ ease: '<', delay: '1.5s' }).attr({ fill: '#f03' }) By default duration will be set to 1000, ease will be set to <>. You can chain multiple animations together by calling animate again: rect.animate({ ease: '<', delay: '1.5s' }).attr({ fill: '#f03' }).animate().dmove(50,50) returns: SVG.FX delay() Alternatively you can call delay() which will set an delay in ms before the next animation in the queue is run rect.animate({ ease: '<', delay: '1.5s' }).attr({ fill: '#f03' }).delay(500).animate().dmove(50,50) queue() If you want to call a custom funtion between two chained animations, you simply can queue them up: rect.animate({ ease: '<', delay: '1.5s' }).attr({ fill: '#f03' }).queue(function(){      this.target().fill('#000')     this.dequeue() // dont forget to call dequeue when the queue should continue running  }).animate().dmove(50,50) pause() Pausing an animations is fairly straightforward: rect.animate().move(200, 200)  rect.mouseover(function() { this.pause() }) returns: itself play() Will start playing a paused animation: rect.animate().move(200, 200)  rect.mouseover(function() { this.pause() }) rect.mouseout(function() { this.play() }) returns: itself stop() If you just want to stop an animation you can call the stop() method which has two optional arguments: jumpToEnd: Sets the values to the end of the animation clearQueue: Remove all items from queue rect.animate().move(200, 200)  rect.stop() // or e.g. rect.stop(true) Stopping an animation is irreversable. returns: itself finish() This method finishes the whole animation chain. All values are set to their corresponding end values and every situation gets fullfilled rect.animate().move(200, 200).animate().dmove(50,50).size(300,400)  rect.finish() // rect at 250,250 with size 300,400 returns: itself loop() By default the loop() method creates and eternal loop: rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).loop() But the loop can also be a predefined number of times: rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).loop(3) Loops go from beginning to end and start over again (0->1.0->1.0->1.). There is also a reverse flag that should be passed as the second argument: rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).loop(3, true) Loops will then be completely reversed before starting over (0->1->0->1->0->1.). returns: SVG.FX reverse() Toggles the direction of the animation or sets it to a specific direction: // will run from 100,100 to rects initial position rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).reverse()  // sets direction to backwards rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).reverse(true)  // sets direction to forwards (same as not calling reverse ever) rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).reverse(false) returns: SVG.FX during/duringAll() If you want to perform your own actions during one/all animation you can use the during()/duringAll() method: var position   , from = 100   , to   = 300  rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).during(function(pos, morph, eased, situation) {   position = from + (to - from) * pos })  // or rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).duringAll(function(pos, morph, eased, situation) {   position = from + (to - from) * pos }) Note that pos is 0 in the beginning of the animation and 1 at the end of the animation. To make things easier a morphing function is passed as the second argument. This function accepts a from and to value as the first and second argument and they can be a number, unit or hex color: var ellipse = draw.ellipse(100, 100).attr('cx', '20%').fill('#333')  rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).during(function(pos, morph, eased, situation) {   // numeric values   ellipse.size(morph(100, 200), morph(100, 50))    // unit strings   ellipse.attr('cx', morph('20%', '80%'))    // hex color strings   ellipse.fill(morph('#333', '#ff0066')) }) The eased parameter contains the position after the easing function was applied. The last parameter holds the current situation related to the current during call. You can call during()/duringAll() multiple times to add more functions which should be executed. returns: SVG.FX after/afterAll() Furthermore, you can add callback methods using after()/afterAll(): rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).after(function(situation) {   this.animate().attr({ fill: '#f06' }) })  // or rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).afterAll(function() {   this.animate().attr({ fill: '#f06' }) }) The function gets the situation which was finished as first parameter. This doesn't apply to afterAll where no parameter is passed Note that the after()/afterAll() method will never be called if the animation is looping eternally. You can call after()/afterAll() multiple times to add more functions which should be executed. returns: SVG.FX once() Finally, you can perform an action at a specific position only once. Just pass the position and the function which should be executed to the once method. You can also decide whether the position which is passed should be handled as position in time (not eased) or position in space (easing applied): // the 0.5 is handled as uneased value (you can omit the false) rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).once(0.5, function(pos, eased) {   // do something }, false) // the 0.5 is handled as eased value rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).once(0.5, function(pos, eased) {   // do something }, true) The callback function gets the current position uneased and eased returns: SVG.FX at() Say you want to control the position of an animation with an external event, then the at() method will proove very useful: var animation = draw.rect(100, 100).move(50, 50).animate('=').move(200, 200)  document.onmousemove = function(event) {   animation.at(event.clientX / 1000) } The value passed as the first argument of at() should be a number between 0 and 1, 0 being the beginning of the animation and 1 being the end. Note that any values below 0 and above 1 will be normalized. Also note that the value is eased after calling the function. Therefore the position specifies a position in time not in space. This functionality requires the fx.js module which is included in the default distribution. returns: SVG.FX target() The target method returns the element the animation is applied to: rect.fx.target() // returns rect getterreturns: SVG.Element situation The current situation of an animation is stored in the situation object: rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100) rect.fx.situation //-> everything is in here Available values are: start (start time as a number in milliseconds) play (animation playing or not; true or false) pause (time when the animation was last paused) duration (the chosen duration of the animation) ease (the chosen easing calculation) finish (start + duration) loop (the current loop; counting down if a number; true, false or a number) loops (if a number, the total number loops; true, false or a number) reverse (whether or not the animation should run backwards) reversing (true if the loop is currently reversing, otherwise false) Masking elements maskWith() The easiest way to mask is to use a single element: var ellipse = draw.ellipse(80, 40).move(10, 10).fill({ color: '#fff' })  rect.maskWith(ellipse) returns: itself mask() But you can also use multiple elements: var ellipse = draw.ellipse(80, 40).move(10, 10).fill({ color: '#fff' }) var text = draw.text('SVG.JS').move(10, 10).font({ size: 36 }).fill({ color: '#fff' })  var mask = draw.mask().add(text).add(ellipse)  rect.maskWith(mask) If you want the masked object to be rendered at 100% you need to set the fill color of the masking object to white. But you might also want to use a gradient: var gradient = draw.gradient('linear', function(stop) {   stop.at({ offset: 0, color: '#000' })   stop.at({ offset: 1, color: '#fff' }) })  var ellipse = draw.ellipse(80, 40).move(10, 10).fill({ color: gradient })  rect.maskWith(ellipse) returns: SVG.Mask unmask() Unmasking the elements can be done with the unmask() method: rect.unmask() The unmask() method returns the masking element. returns: itself remove() Removing the mask alltogether will also unmask() all masked elements as well: mask.remove() returns: itself masker For your convenience, the masking element is also referenced in the masked element. This can be useful in case you want to change the mask: rect.masker.fill('#fff') This functionality requires the mask.js module which is included in the default distribution. Clipping elements Clipping elements works exactly the same as masking elements. The only difference is that clipped elements will adopt the geometry of the clipping element. Therefore events are only triggered when entering the clipping element whereas with masks the masked element triggers the event. Another difference is that masks can define opacity with their fill color and clipPaths don't. clipWith() var ellipse = draw.ellipse(80, 40).move(10, 10)  rect.clipWith(ellipse) returns: itself clip() Clip multiple elements: var ellipse = draw.ellipse(80, 40).move(10, 10) var text = draw.text('SVG.JS').move(10, 10).font({ size: 36 })  var clip = draw.clip().add(text).add(ellipse)  rect.clipWith(clip) returns: SVG.ClipPath unclip() Unclipping the elements can be done with the unclip() method: rect.unclip() returns: itself remove() Removing the clip alltogether will also unclip() all clipped elements as well: clip.remove() returns: itself clipper For your convenience, the clipping element is also referenced in the clipped element. This can be useful in case you want to change the clipPath: rect.clipper.move(10, 10) This functionality requires the clip.js module which is included in the default distribution. Arranging elements You can arrange elements within their parent SVG document using the following methods. front() Move element to the front: rect.front() returns: itself back() Move element to the back: rect.back() returns: itself forward() Move element one step forward: rect.forward() returns: itself backward() Move element one step backward: rect.backward() returns: itself siblings() The arrange.js module brings some additional methods. To get all siblings of rect, including rect itself: rect.siblings() returns: array position() Get the position (a number) of rect between its siblings: rect.position() returns: number next() Get the next sibling: rect.next() returns: element previous() Get the previous sibling: rect.previous() returns: element before() Insert an element before another: // inserts circle before rect rect.before(circle) returns: itself after() Insert an element after another: // inserts circle after rect rect.after(circle) returns: itself This functionality requires the arrange.js module which is included in the default distribution. Sets Sets are very useful if you want to modify or animate multiple elements at once. A set will accept all the same methods accessible on individual elements, even the ones that you add with your own plugins! Creating a set is exactly as you would expect: // create some elements var rect = draw.rect(100,100) var circle = draw.circle(100).move(100,100).fill('#f09')  // create a set and add the elements var set = draw.set() set.add(rect).add(circle)  // change the fill of all elements in the set at once set.fill('#ff0') A single element can be a member of many sets. Sets also don't have a structural representation, in fact they are just fancy array's. add() Add an element to a set: set.add(rect) Quite a useful feature of sets is the ability to accept multiple elements at once: set.add(rect, circle) returns: itself each() Iterating over all members in a set is the same as with svg containers: set.each(function(i) {   this.attr('id', 'shiny_new_id_' + i) }) Note that this refers to the current child element. returns: itself has() Determine if an element is member of the set: set.has(rect) returns: boolean index() Returns the index of a given element in the set. set.index(rect) //-> -1 if element is not a member returns: number get() Gets the element at a given index: set.get(1) returns: element first() Gets the first element: set.first() returns: element last() Gets the last element: set.last() returns: element bbox() Get the bounding box of all elements in the set: set.bbox() returns: SVG.BBox remove() To remove an element from a set: set.remove(rect) returns: itself clear() Or to remove all elements from a set: set.clear() returns: itself animate() Sets work with animations as well: set.animate(3000).fill('#ff0') returns: SVG.SetFX Gradient gradient() There are linear and radial gradients. The linear gradient can be created like this: var gradient = draw.gradient('linear', function(stop) {   stop.at(0, '#333')   stop.at(1, '#fff') }) returns: SVG.Gradient at() The offset and color parameters are required for stops, opacity is optional. Offset is float between 0 and 1, or a percentage value (e.g. 33%). stop.at(0, '#333') or stop.at({ offset: 0, color: '#333', opacity: 1 }) returns: itself from() To define the direction you can set from x, y and to x, y: gradient.from(0, 0).to(0, 1) The from and to values are also expressed in percent. returns: itself to() To define the direction you can set from x, y and to x, y: gradient.from(0, 0).to(0, 1) The from and to values are also expressed in percent. returns: itself radius() Radial gradients have a radius() method to define the outermost radius to where the inner color should develop: var gradient = draw.gradient('radial', function(stop) {   stop.at(0, '#333')   stop.at(1, '#fff') })  gradient.from(0.5, 0.5).to(0.5, 0.5).radius(0.5) returns: itself update() A gradient can also be updated afterwards: gradient.update(function(stop) {   stop.at(0.1, '#333', 0.2)   stop.at(0.9, '#f03', 1) }) And even a single stop can be updated: var s1, s2, s3  draw.gradient('radial', function(stop) {   s1 = stop.at(0, '#000')   s2 = stop.at(0.5, '#f03')   s3 = stop.at(1, '#066') })  s1.update(0.1, '#0f0', 1) returns: itself get() The get() method makes it even easier to get a stop from an existing gradient: var gradient = draw.gradient('radial', function(stop) {   stop.at({ offset: 0, color: '#000', opacity: 1 })   // -> first   stop.at({ offset: 0.5, color: '#f03', opacity: 1 }) // -> second   stop.at({ offset: 1, color: '#066', opacity: 1 })   // -> third })  var s1 = gradient.get(0) // -> returns ""first"" stop returns: SVG.Stop fill() Finally, to use the gradient on an element: rect.attr({ fill: gradient }) Or: rect.fill(gradient) By passing the gradient instance as the fill on any element, the fill() method will be called: gradient.fill() //-> returns 'url(#SvgjsGradient1234)' W3Schools has a great example page on how linear gradients and radial gradients work. This functionality requires the gradient.js module which is included in the default distribution. returns: value Pattern pattern() Creating a pattern is very similar to creating gradients: var pattern = draw.pattern(20, 20, function(add) {   add.rect(20,20).fill('#f06')   add.rect(10,10)   add.rect(10,10).move(10,10) }) This creates a checkered pattern of 20 x 20 pixels. You can add any available element to your pattern. returns: SVG.Pattern update() A pattern can also be updated afterwards: pattern.update(function(add) {   add.circle(15).center(10,10) }) returns: itself fill() Finally, to use the pattern on an element: rect.attr({ fill: pattern }) Or: rect.fill(pattern) By passing the pattern instance as the fill on any element, the fill() method will be called on th pattern instance: pattern.fill() //-> returns 'url(#SvgjsPattern1234)' returns: value Marker marker() Markers can be added to every individual point of a line, polyline, polygon and path. There are three types of markers: start, mid and end. Where start represents the first point, end the last and mid every point in between. var path = draw.path('M 100 200 C 200 100 300  0 400 100 C 500 200 600 300 700 200 C 800 100 900 100 900 100z')  path.fill('none').stroke({ width: 1 })  path.marker('start', 10, 10, function(add) {   add.circle(10).fill('#f06') }) path.marker('mid', 10, 10, function(add) {   add.rect(10, 10) }) path.marker('end', 20, 20, function(add) {   add.circle(6).center(4, 5)   add.circle(6).center(4, 15)   add.circle(6).center(16, 10)    this.fill('#0f6') }) The marker() method can be used in three ways. Firstly, a marker can be created on any container element (e.g. svg, nested, group, ...). This is useful if you plan to reuse the marker many times so it will create a marker in the defs but not show it yet: var marker = draw.marker(10, 10, function(add) {   add.rect(10, 10) }) Secondly a marker can be created and applied directly on its target element: path.marker('start', 10, 10, function(add) {   add.circle(10).fill('#f06') }) This will create a marker in the defs and apply it directly. Note that the first argument defines the position of the marker and that there are four arguments as opposed to three with the first example. Lastly, if a marker is created for reuse on a container element, it can be applied directly on the target element: path.marker('mid', marker) Finally, to get a marker instance from the target element reference: path.reference('marker-end') ref() By default the refX and refY attributes of a marker are set to respectively half the width nd height values. To define the refX and refY of a marker differently: marker.ref(2, 7) returns: itself update() Updating the contents of a marker will clear() the existing content and add the content defined in the block passed as the first argument: marker.update(function(add) {   add.circle(10) }) returns: itself width() Defines the markerWidth attribute: marker.width(10) returns: itself height() Defines the markerHeight attribute: marker.height(10) returns: itself size() Defines the markerWidth and markerHeight attributes: marker.size(10, 10) returns: itself Data Setting The data() method allows you to bind arbitrary objects, strings and numbers to SVG elements: rect.data('key', { value: { data: 0.3 }}) Or set multiple values at once: rect.data({   forbidden: 'fruit' , multiple: {     values: 'in'   , an: 'object'   } }) returns: itself Getting Fetching the values is similar to the attr() method: rect.data('key') returns: itself Removing Removing the data altogether: rect.data('key', null) returns: itself Sustaining data types Your values will always be stored as JSON and in some cases this might not be desirable. If you want to store the value as-is, just pass true as the third argument: rect.data('key', 'value', true) returns: itself Memory remember() Storing data in-memory is very much like setting attributes: rect.remember('oldBBox', rect.bbox()) Multiple values can also be remembered at once: rect.remember({   oldFill:    rect.attr('fill') , oldStroke:  rect.attr('stroke') }) To retrieve a memory rect.remember('oldBBox') returns: itself forget() Erasing a single memory: rect.forget('oldBBox') Or erasing multiple memories at once: rect.forget('oldFill', 'oldStroke') And finally, just erasing the whole memory: rect.forget() returns: itself Events Basic events Events can be bound to elements as follows: rect.click(function() {   this.fill({ color: '#f06' }) }) Removing it is quite as easy: rect.click(null) All available events are: click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, mouseover, mouseout, mousemove, touchstart, touchmove, touchleave, touchend and touchcancel. returns: itself Event listeners You can also bind event listeners to elements: var click = function() {   this.fill({ color: '#f06' }) }  rect.on('click', click) Note: The context of this in the callback is bound to the element. You can change this context by applying your own object: rect.on('click', click, window) // context of this is window returns: itself Unbinding events is just as easy: rect.off('click', click) Or to unbind all listeners for a given event: rect.off('click') Or even unbind all listeners for all events: rect.off() returns: itself But there is more to event listeners. You can bind events to html elements as well: SVG.on(window, 'click', click) Obviously unbinding is practically the same: SVG.off(window, 'click', click) Custom events You can even use your own events. Just add an event listener for your event: rect.on('myevent', function() {   alert('ta-da!') }) Now you are ready to fire the event whenever you need: function whenSomethingHappens() {   rect.fire('myevent') }  // or if you want to pass an event function whenSomethingHappens(event) {   rect.fire(event) }  You can also pass some data to the event: function whenSomethingHappens() {   rect.fire('myevent', {some:'data'}) }  rect.on('myevent', function(e) {   alert(e.detail.some) // outputs 'data' }) svg.js supports namespaced events following the syntax event.namespace. A namespaced event behaves like a normal event with the difference that you can remove it without touching handlers from other namespaces. // attach rect.on('myevent.namespace', function(e) {   // do something })  // detach all handlers of namespace for myevent rect.off('myevent.namespace')  // detach all handlers of namespace rect.off('.namespace')  // detach all handlers including all namespaces rect.off('myevent)  However you can't fire a specific namespaced event. Calling rect.fire('myevent.namespace') won't do anything while rect.fire('myevent') works and fires all attached handlers of the event Important: always make sure you namespace your event to avoid conflicts. Preferably use something very specific. So event.wicked for example would be better than something generic like event.svg. Numbers Numbers in SVG.js have a dedicated number class to be able to process string values. Creating a new number is simple: var number = new SVG.Number('78%') number.plus('3%').toString() //-> returns '81%' number.valueOf() //-> returns 0.81 Operators are defined as methods on the SVG.Number instance. plus() Addition: number.plus('3%') returns: SVG.Number minus() Subtraction: number.minus('3%') returns: SVG.Number times() Multiplication: number.times(2) returns: SVG.Number divide() Division: number.divide('3%') returns: SVG.Number to() Change number to another unit: number.to('px') returns: SVG.Number morph() Make a number morphable: number.morph('11%') returns: itself at() Get morphable number at given position: var number = new SVG.Number('79%').morph('3%') number.at(0.55).toString() //-> '37.2%' returns: SVG.Number Colors Svg.js has a dedicated color class handling different types of colors. Accepted values are: hex string; three based (e.g. #f06) or six based (e.g. #ff0066) new SVG.Color('#f06') rgb string; e.g. rgb(255, 0, 102) new SVG.Color('rgb(255, 0, 102)') rgb object; e.g. { r: 255, g: 0, b: 102 } new SVG.Color({ r: 255, g: 0, b: 102 }) Note that when working with objects is important to provide all three values every time. The SVG.Color instance has a few methods of its own. toHex() Get hex value: color.toHex() //-> returns '#ff0066' returns: hex color string toRgb() Get rgb string value: color.toRgb() //-> returns 'rgb(255,0,102)' returns: rgb color string brightness() Get the brightness of a color: color.brightness() //-> returns 0.344 This is the perceived brighness where 0 is black and 1 is white. returns: number morph() Make a color morphable: color.morph('#000') returns: itself at() Get morphable color at given position: var color = new SVG.Color('#ff0066').morph('#000') color.at(0.5).toHex() //-> '#7f0033' returns: SVG.Color Arrays In SVG.js every value list string can be cast and passed as an array. This makes writing them more convenient but also adds a lot of key functionality to them. SVG.Array Is for simple, whitespace separated value strings: '0.343 0.669 0.119 0 0 0.249 -0.626 0.13 0 0 0.172 0.334 0.111 0 0 0 0 0 1 0' Can also be passed like this in a more manageable format: new SVG.Array([ .343,  .669, .119, 0,   0               , .249, -.626, .130, 0,   0               , .172,  .334, .111, 0,   0               , .000,  .000, .000, 1,  -0 ]) SVG.PointArray Is a bit more complex and is used for polyline and polygon elements. This is a poly-point string: '0,0 100,100' The dynamic representation: [   [0, 0] , [100, 100] ] Precompiling it as an SVG.PointArray: new SVG.PointArray([   [0, 0] , [100, 100] ]) Note that every instance of SVG.Polyline and SVG.Polygon carries a reference to the SVG.PointArray instance: polygon.array() //-> returns the SVG.PointArray instance Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.PointArray < SVG.Array SVG.PathArray Path arrays carry arrays representing every segment in a path string: 'M0 0L100 100z' The dynamic representation: [   ['M', 0, 0] , ['L', 100, 100] , ['z'] ] Precompiling it as an SVG.PathArray: new SVG.PathArray([   ['M', 0, 0] , ['L', 100, 100] , ['z'] ]) Note that every instance of SVG.Path carries a reference to the SVG.PathArray instance: path.array() //-> returns the SVG.PathArray instance Syntax The syntax for patharrays is very predictable. They are basically literal representations in the form of two dimentional arrays. Move To Original syntax is M0 0 or m0 0. The SVG.js syntax ['M',0,0] or ['m',0,0].

Javascript inheritance stack: SVG.PathArray < SVG.Array morph() In order to animate array values the morph() method lets you pass a destination value. This can be either the string value, a plain array or an instance of the same type of SVG.js array: var array = new SVG.PointArray([[0, 0], [100, 100]]) array.morph('100,0 0,100 200,200') This method will prepare the array ensuring both the source and destination arrays have the same length. In order to morph paths you need to include the svg.pathmorphing.js extension. returns: itself at() This method will morph the array to a given position between 0 and 1. Continuing with the previous example: array.at(0.27).toString() //-> returns '27,0 73,100 127,127' Note that this method is currently not available on SVG.PathArray but will be soon. returns: new instance settle() When morphing is done the settle() method will eliminate any transitional points like duplicates: array.settle() Note that this method is currently not available on SVG.PathArray but will be soon. returns: itself move() Moves geometry of the array with the given x and y values: var array = new SVG.PointArray([[0, 0], [100, 100]]) array.move(33,75) array.toString() //-> returns '33,75 133,175' Note that this method is only available on SVG.PointArray and SVG.PathArray returns: itself size() Resizes geometry of the array by the given width and height values: var array = new SVG.PointArray([[0, 0], [100, 100]]) array.move(100,100).size(222,333) array.toString() //-> returns '100,100 322,433' Note that this method is only available on SVG.PointArray and SVG.PathArray returns: itself reverse() Reverses the order of the array: var array = new SVG.PointArray([[0, 0], [100, 100]]) array.reverse() array.toString() //-> returns '100,100 0,0' returns: itself bbox() Gets the bounding box of the geometry of the array: array.bbox() Note that this method is only available on SVG.PointArray and SVG.PathArray returns: object Matrices Matrices in SVG.js have their own class SVG.Matrix, wrapping the native SVGMatrix. They add a lot of functionality like extracting transform values, matrix morphing and improvements on the native methods. SVG.Matrix In SVG.js matrices accept various values on initialization. Without a value: var matrix = new SVG.Matrix matrix.toString() //-> returns matrix(1,0,0,1,0,0) Six arguments: var matrix = new SVG.Matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 100, 150) matrix.toString() //-> returns matrix(1,0,0,1,100,150) A string value: var matrix = new SVG.Matrix('1,0,0,1,100,150') matrix.toString() //-> returns matrix(1,0,0,1,100,150) An object value: var matrix = new SVG.Matrix({ a: 1, b: 0, c: 0, d: 1, e: 100, f: 150 }) matrix.toString() //-> returns matrix(1,0,0,1,100,150) A native SVGMatrix: var svgMatrix = svgElement.getCTM() var matrix = new SVG.Matrix(svgMatrix) matrix.toString() //-> returns matrix(1,0,0,1,0,0) Even an instance of SVG.Element: var rect = draw.rect(50, 25) var matrix = new SVG.Matrix(rect) matrix.toString() //-> returns matrix(1,0,0,1,0,0) extract() Gets the calculated values of the matrix as an object: matrix.extract() The returned object contains the following values: x (translation on the x-axis) y (translation on the y-axis) skewX (calculated skew on x-axis) skewY (calculated skew on y-axis) scaleX (calculated scale on x-axis) scaleY (calculated scale on y-axis) rotation (calculated rotation) returns: object clone() Returns an exact copy of the matrix: matrix.clone() returns: SVG.Matrix morph() In order to animate matrices the morph() method lets you pass a destination matrix. This can be any value a SVG.Matrix would accept on initialization: matrix.morph('matrix(2,0,0,2,100,150)') returns: itself at() This method will morph the matrix to a given position between 0 and 1: matrix.at(0.27) This will only work when a destination matirx is defined using the morph() method. returns: SVG.Matrix multiply() Multiplies by another given matrix: matrix.matrix(matrix2) returns: SVG.Matrix inverse() Creates an inverted matix: matrix.inverse() returns: SVG.Matrix translate() Translates matrix by a given x and y value: matrix.translate(10, 20) returns: SVG.Matrix scale() Scales matrix uniformal with one value: // scale matrix.scale(2) Scales matrix non-uniformal with two values: // scaleX, scaleY matrix.scale(2, 3) Scales matrix uniformal on a given center point with three values: // scale, cx, cy matrix.scale(2, 100, 150) Scales matrix non-uniformal on a given center point with four values: // scaleX, scaleY, cx, cy matrix.scale(2, 3, 100, 150) returns: SVG.Matrix rotate() Rotates matrix by degrees with one value given: // degrees matrix.rotate(45) Rotates a matrix by degrees around a given point with three values: // degrees, cx, cy matrix.rotate(45, 100, 150) returns: SVG.Matrix flip() Flips matrix over a given axis: matrix.flip('x') or matrix.flip('y') By default elements are flipped over their center point. The flip axis position can be defined with the second argument: matrix.flip('x', 150) or matrix.flip('y', 100) returns: SVG.Matrix skew() Skews matrix a given degrees over x and or y axis with two values: // degreesX, degreesY matrix.skew(0, 45) Skews matrix a given degrees over x and or y axis on a given point with four values: // degreesX, degreesY, cx, cy matrix.skew(0, 45, 150, 100) returns: SVG.Matrix around() Performs a given matrix transformation around a given center point: // cx, cy, matrix matrix.around(100, 150, new SVG.Matrix().skew(0, 45)) The matrix passed as the third argument will be used to multiply. returns: SVG.Matrix native() Returns a native SVGMatrix extracted from the SVG.Matrix instance: matrix.native() returns: SVGMatrix toString() Converts the matrix to a transform string: matrix.toString() // -> matrix(1,0,0,1,0,0) returns: string Extending functionality SVG.invent() Creating your own custom elements with SVG.js is a piece of cake thanks to the SVG.invent function. For the sake of this example, lets ""invent"" a shape. We want a rect with rounded corners that are always proportional to the height of the element. The new shape lives in the SVG namespace and is called Rounded. Here is how we achieve that. SVG.Rounded = SVG.invent({   // Define the type of element that should be created   create: 'rect'    // Specify from which existing class this shape inherits , inherit: SVG.Shape    // Add custom methods to invented shape , extend: {     // Create method to proportionally scale the rounded corners     size: function(width, height) {       return this.attr({         width:  width       , height: height       , rx:     height / 5       , ry:     height / 5       })     }   }    // Add method to parent elements , construct: {     // Create a rounded element     rounded: function(width, height) {       return this.put(new SVG.Rounded).size(width, height)     }    } }) To create the element in your drawing: var rounded = draw.rounded(200, 100) That's it, the invention is now ready to be used! Accepted values The SVG.invent() function always expects an object. The object can have the following configuration values: create: can be either a string with the node name (e.g. rect, ellipse, ...) or a custom initializer function; [required] inherit: the desired SVG.js class to inherit from (e.g. SVG.Shape, SVG.Element, SVG.Container, SVG.Rect, ...); [optional but recommended] extend: an object with the methods that should be applied to the element's prototype; [optional] construct: an object with the methods to create the element on the parent element; [optional] parent: an SVG.js parent class on which the methods in the passed construct object should be available - defaults to SVG.Container; [optional] Usage notes It should be emphasized that in the configuration object passed to SVG.invent(): construct does not supply constructors, but rather methods that are likely to call constructors; create specifies the constructor for the type you are defining, and is not analogous to Object.create(). When defining specialized svg elements (such as SVG.Rounded in the example above), the function specified by create needs to do all the work of adding the element to the DOM for the svg document and connecting the DOM node to the SVG.js interface. All this is done automatically when the value of create is a string identifying an element type. If needed, see the source for a sense of how to do it explicitly. Though the defaults are geared toward creating svg elements for the SVG.js framework, SVG.invent() can be used as a generalized function for defining types in Javascript. When used in this more general way, the function supplied as a value for create should be written as an ordinary JS constructor. (Indeed, the function is simply returned as the constructor for your newly defined type.) Svg.js uses the SVG.invent() function to create all internal elements. A look at the source will show how this function is used in various ways. SVG.extend() SVG.js has a modular structure. It is very easy to add your own methods at different levels. Let's say we want to add a method to all shape types then we would add our method to SVG.Shape: SVG.extend(SVG.Shape, {   paintRed: function() {     return this.fill('red')   } }) Now all shapes will have the paintRed method available. Say we want to have the paintRed method on an ellipse apply a slightly different color: SVG.extend(SVG.Ellipse, {   paintRed: function() {     return this.fill('orangered')   } })  The complete inheritance stack for SVG.Ellipse is: SVG.Ellipse < SVG.Shape < SVG.Element The SVG document can be extended by using: SVG.extend(SVG.Doc, {   paintAllPink: function() {     this.each(function() {       this.fill('pink')     })   } }) You can also extend multiple elements at once: SVG.extend(SVG.Ellipse, SVG.Path, SVG.Polygon, {   paintRed: function() {     return this.fill('orangered')   } }) Plugins Here are a few nice plugins that are available for SVG.js: pathmorphing svg.pathmorphing.js to make path animatable textmorphing svg.textmorph.js to make text animatable absorb svg.absorb.js absorb raw SVG data into an SVG.js instance. draggable svg.draggable.js to make elements draggable. connectable svg.connectable.js to connect elements. svg.connectable.js fork to connect elements (added: curved connectors, you can use any self-made path as a connector, choosable 'center'/'perifery' attachment, 'perifery' attachment for source / target SVG Paths uses smallest-distance algorithm between PathArray points) easing svg.easing.js for more easing methods on animations. export svg.export.js export raw SVG. filter svg.filter.js adding svg filters to elements. foreignobject svg.foreignobject.js foreignObject implementation (by john-memloom). import svg.import.js import raw SVG data. math svg.math.js a math extension (by Nils Lagerkvist). path svg.path.js for manually drawing paths (by Nils Lagerkvist). screenBBox svg.screenbbox.js to get the bbox in screen coordinates from transformed path/polygon/polyline shapes svg.shapes.js for more polygon based shapes. topath svg.topath.js to convert any other shape to a path. topoly svg.topoly.js to convert a path to polygon or polyline. wiml svg.wiml.js a templating language for svg output. comic comic.js to cartoonize any given svg. draw svg.draw.js to draw elements with your mouse select svg.select.js to select elements resize svg.resize.js to resize elements with your mouse Contributing We love contributions. Yes indeed, we used the word LOVE! But please make sure you follow the same coding style. Here are some guidelines. Indentation We do it with two spaces. Make sure you don't start using tabs because then things get messy. Avoid hairy code We like to keep things simple and clean, don't write anything you don't need. So use single quotes where possible and avoid semicolons, we're not writing PHP here. Good: var text = draw.text('with single quotes here')   , nest = draw.nested().attr('x', '50%')  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++)   if (i != 3)     nest.circle(i * 100) Bad: var text = draw.text(""with double quotes here""); var nest = draw.nested().attr(""x"", ""50%"");  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {   if (i != 3) {     nest.circle(100);   }; }; Minimize variable declarations All local variables should be declared at the beginning of a function or method unless there is ony one variable to declare. Although it is not required to assign them at the same moment. When if statements are involved, requiring some variables only to be present in the statement, the necessary variables should be declared right after the if statement. Good: function reading_board() {   var aap, noot, mies    aap  = 1   noot = 2   mies = aap + noot } Bad: function reading_board() {   var aap  = 1   var noot = 2   var mies = aap + noot } Let your code breathe people! Don't try to be a code compressor yourself, they do way a better job anyway. Give your code some spaces and newlines. Good: var nest = draw.nested().attr({   x:      10 , y:      20 , width:  200 , height: 300 })  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++)   nest.circle(100) Bad: var nest=draw.nested().attr({x:10,y:20,width:200,height:300}); for(var i=0;i<5;i++)nest.circle(100); It won't hurt to add a few comments Where necessary tell us what you are doing but be concise. We only use single-line comments. Also keep your variable and method names short while maintaining readability. Good: // Adds orange-specific methods SVG.extend(SVG.Rect, {   // Add a nice, transparent orange   orangify: function() {     // fill with orange color     this.fill('orange')      // add a slight opacity     return this.opacity(0.85)   } }) Bad: /*  *  * does something with orange and opacity  *  */ SVG.extend(SVG.Rect, {   orgf: function() {     return this.fill('orange').opacity(0.85)   } }) Refactor your code Once your implementation is ready, revisit and rework it. We like to keep it DRY. Test. Your. Code. It's not that hard to write at least one example per implementation, although we prefer more. Your code might seem to work by quickly testing it in your browser but more than often you can't forsee everything. Before running the specs you will need to build the library. Be aware that pull requests without specs will be declined. Building After contributing you probably want to build the library to run some specs.

API Trianglify exposes a single function into the global namespace, called Trianglify. This takes a single options object as an argument and returns a pattern object. var Trianglify = require('trianglify'); // only needed in node.js var pattern = Trianglify({width: 200, height: 200}) The pattern object contains data about the generated pattern's options and geometry, as well as rending implementations. pattern.opts Object containing the options used to generate the pattern. pattern.polys The colors and vertices of the polygons that make up the pattern, in the following format: [   ['color', [vertex, vertex, vertex]],   ['color', [vertex, vertex, vertex]],   ... ] pattern.svg([opts]) Rendering function for SVG. Returns an SVGElement DOM node. Takes an optional options object. Currently the only supported option is {includeNamespace: true}, which will cause the output to include an xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' attribute. This is helpful if you intend to serialize the svg string to a file, as most browsers and vector graphics programs require it. See #41 for more details about this option. pattern.canvas([HTMLCanvasElement]) Rendering function for canvas. When called with no arguments returns a HTMLCanvasElement DOM node. When passed an existing canvas element as an argument, renders the pattern to the existing canvas. To use this in a node.js environment, the optional dependency node-canvas needs to be installed. pattern.png() Rendering function for PNG. Returns a data URI with the PNG data in base64 encoding. See examples/save-as-png.js for an example of decoding this into a file. Options Trianglify is configured by an options object passed in as the only argument. The following option keys are supported: width Integer, defaults to 600. Specify the width in pixels of the pattern to generate. height Integer, defaults to 400. Specify the height in pixels of the pattern to generate. cell_size Integer, defaults to 75. Specify the size of the mesh used to generate triangles. Larger values will result in coarser patterns, smaller values will result in finer patterns. Note that very small values may dramatically increase the runtime of Trianglify. variance Decimal value between 0 and 1 (inclusive), defaults to 0.75. Specify the amount of randomness used when generating triangles. seed Number or string, defaults to null. Seeds the random number generator to create repeatable patterns. When set to null, the random number will be seeded with random values from the environment. An example usage would be passing in blog post titles as the seed to generate unique trianglify patterns for every post on a blog that won't change when the page reloads. x_colors String or array of CSS-formatted colors, default is 'random'. Specify the color gradient used on the x axis. Valid string values are 'random' or the name of a colorbrewer palette (i.e. 'YlGnBu' or 'RdBu'). When set to 'random', a gradient will be randomly selected from the colorbrewer library. Valid array values should specify the color stops in any CSS format (i.e. ['#000000', '#4CAFE8', '#FFFFFF']). y_colors String or array of CSS-formatted colors, default is 'match_x'. When set to 'match_x' the same gradient will be used on both axes. Otherwise, accepts the same options as x_colors. color_space String, defaults to 'lab'. Set the color space used for generating gradients. Supported values are rgb, hsv, hsl, hsi, lab and hcl. See this blog post for some background on why this matters. color_function Specify a custom function for coloring triangles, defaults to null. Accepts a function to override the standard gradient coloring that takes the x,y coordinates of a triangle's centroid as arguments and returns a CSS-formatted color string representing the color that triangle should have. Here is an example color function that uses the HSL color format to generate a rainbow pattern: var colorFunc = function(x, y) {     return 'hsl('+Math.floor(Math.abs(x*y)*360)+',80%,60%)'; };  var pattern = Trianglify({color_function: colorFunc}) stroke_width Number, defaults to 1.51. Specify the width of the stroke on triangle shapes in the pattern. The default value is the ideal value for eliminating antialiasing artifacts when rendering patterns to a canvas. points Array of points ([x, y]) to trianglulate. When not specified an array randomised points is generated filling the space. License Trianglify is GPLv3 licensed.

Sep 24, 2015 package.json Include build in NPM package. Oct 15, 2015 README.md Word Cloud Layout This is a Wordle-inspired word cloud layout written in JavaScript. It uses HTML5 canvas and sprite masks to achieve near-interactive speeds. See here for an interactive demonstration along with implementation details. Usage See the samples in examples/. API Reference # d3.layout.cloud() Constructs a new cloud layout instance. # on(type, listener) Registers the specified listener to receive events of the specified type from the layout. Currently, only ""word"" and ""end"" events are supported. A ""word"" event is dispatched every time a word is successfully placed. Registered listeners are called with a single argument: the word object that has been placed. An ""end"" event is dispatched when the layout has finished attempting to place all words. Registered listeners are called with two arguments: an array of the word objects that were successfully placed, and a bounds object of the form [{x0, y0}, {x1, y1}] representing the extent of the placed objects. # start() Starts the layout algorithm. This initialises various attributes on the word objects, and attempts to place each word, starting with the largest word. Starting with the centre of the rectangular area, each word is tested for collisions with all previously-placed words. If a collision is found, it tries to place the word in a new position along the spiral. Note: if a word cannot be placed in any of the positions attempted along the spiral, it is not included in the final word layout. This may be addressed in a future release. # stop() Stops the layout algorithm. # timeInterval([time]) Internally, the layout uses setInterval to avoid locking up the browser’s event loop. If specified, time is the maximum amount of time that can be spent during the current timestep. If not specified, returns the current maximum time interval, which defaults to Infinity. # words([words]) If specified, sets the words array. If not specified, returns the current words array, which defaults to []. # size([size]) If specified, sets the rectangular [width, height] of the layout. If not specified, returns the current size, which defaults to [1, 1]. # font([font]) If specified, sets the font accessor function, which indicates the font face for each word. If not specified, returns the current font accessor function, which defaults to ""serif"". A constant may be specified instead of a function. # fontStyle([fontStyle]) If specified, sets the fontStyle accessor function, which indicates the font style for each word. If not specified, returns the current fontStyle accessor function, which defaults to ""normal"". A constant may be specified instead of a function. # fontWeight([fontWeight]) If specified, sets the fontWeight accessor function, which indicates the font weight for each word. If not specified, returns the current fontWeight accessor function, which defaults to ""normal"". A constant may be specified instead of a function. # fontSize([fontSize]) If specified, sets the fontSize accessor function, which indicates the numerical font size for each word. If not specified, returns the current fontSize accessor function, which defaults to: function(d) { return Math.sqrt(d.value); } A constant may be specified instead of a function. # rotate([rotate]) If specified, sets the rotate accessor function, which indicates the rotation angle (in degrees) for each word. If not specified, returns the current rotate accessor function, which defaults to: function() { return (~~(Math.random() * 6) - 3) * 30; } A constant may be specified instead of a function. # text([text]) If specified, sets the text accessor function, which indicates the text for each word. If not specified, returns the current text accessor function, which defaults to: function(d) { return d.text; } A constant may be specified instead of a function. # spiral([spiral]) If specified, sets the current type of spiral used for positioning words. This can either be one of the two built-in spirals, ""archimedean"" and ""rectangular"", or an arbitrary spiral generator can be used, of the following form: // size is the [width, height] array specified in cloud.size function(size) {   // t indicates the current step along the spiral; it may monotonically   // increase or decrease indicating clockwise or counterclockwise motion.   return function(t) { return [x, y]; }; } If not specified, returns the current spiral generator, which defaults to the built-in ""archimedean"" spiral. # padding([padding]) If specified, sets the padding accessor function, which indicates the numerical padding for each word. If not specified, returns the current padding, which defaults to 1. # random([random]) If specified, sets the internal random number generator, used for selecting the initial position of each word, and the clockwise/counterclockwise direction of the spiral for each word. This should return a number in the range [0, 1). If not specified, returns the current random number generator, which defaults to Math.random. # canvas([canvas]) If specified, sets the canvas generator function, which is used internally to draw text. If not specified, returns the current generator function, which defaults to: function() { return document.createElement(""canvas""); } When using Node.js, you will almost definitely override this default, e.g. using the canvas module.

Mar 29, 2016 README.md D4 D4 is a friendly charting DSL for D3. The goal of D4 is to allow developers to quickly build data-driven charts with little knowledge of the internals of D3. Quick Start For the bleeding edge version of d4 download it directly from the github repository. If you prefer a more stable release you can install the latest released tag using a package manager like bower. $ bower install d4 or $ npm install d4  Once you have a local copy of d4 simply include it after d3 in your source file. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head>   <!-- sensible defaults for styles -->   <link href=""d4.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" /> </head> <body>   ... <script src=""d3.js""></script> <script src=""d4.js""></script> </body> </html> Hello World Here is the most basic example, which uses many of the preset defaults provided by d4. var data = [   { x : '2010', y : 5 },   { x : '2011', y : 15 },   { x : '2012', y : 20 } ]; var columnChart = d4.charts.column();  d3.select('someDomElement')   .datum(data)   .call(columnChart); Getting Fancy d4 allows you to quickly build up sophisticated charts using a declarative and highly contextual API that allows you to mixin or mixout features from your chart. var data = [   { x : '2010', y : 5 },   { x : '2011', y : 15 },   { x : '2012', y : 20 } ];  // Create a column chart without a yAxis, but with a grid in the background. var columnChart = d4.charts.column() .mixout('yAxis') .mixin({ 'name' : 'grid', 'feature' : d4.features.grid, 'index' : 0 })  d3.select('someDomElement')   .datum(data)   .call(columnChart); Additional Examples There are many more examples of d4 in the examples site inside the source code repository. Simply clone the repo and open the examples/ folder in your favorite web browser. You can find a hosted version of the example site here: http://visible.io/ You can find a quick-start presentation on d4 here. Philosophy Many charting libraries do a poor job when it comes to separations of concerns. They attempt to be an all-in-one tool, which is at odds with how modern applications are built. Developers do not want a monolith that owns the data transformation, visual aesthetics, and interactivity. This leads to enormous libraries with huge config files, where every minutia about the chart must be decided upon beforehand. This typically means developers must first learn a specialized API in order to control even the most basic aspects of the chart. d4 believes many of these responsibilities would be better delegated to other technologies. If developers were woodworkers then d4 would be a jig, which allows complex cuts to be made in fraction of the time it would normally take. CSS is for styling Many charting libraries make internal decisions on visual aesthetics, which may remove control from the graphic designer, who may or may not understand JavaScript let alone a specialized charting API. Choices on visual design like the colors for data series and font sizes are best made in CSS. d4 exposes convenient hooks in the generated markup to allow visual designer to get precise control over the look and feel without needing deep knowledge of d4. The chart does not own the data Data is a stand-alone object, which can be relied upon by many other scripts on the page. Therefore, a charting library should not change the data object. It can make non-permanent transformations. Context over configuration There is a software design concept called ""convention over configuration,"" which states that software should specify a collection of opinionated defaults for the developer. The goal of this approach is to lessen the number of obvious choices a developer must make before they are able to use the software. Instead, configuration should be saved for instances where the defaults do not apply. d4 extends this concept a bit and suggests that configuration should also be highly contextual to the object the developer needs changed. Instead of making choices in some abstract config file, developers instead use a highly declarative API to make changes directly to the object they want augment. Terminology d4 uses specific terms to describe the components of a chart. Chart - The data rendered by d3 into a graphical representation. Feature - A visual component of a chart, which helps convey meaning in the data. Dimension - A segment of the data described by the chart. Parser - A parser prepares the data for a chart.

Fork the project on GitHub. Make your feature addition or bug fix. Commit with Git. Send @heavysixer a pull request. Inspiration Where possible d4 follows existing d3 community best-practices. The inspiration of D4's modular and declarative structure came from Mike Bostock's article on writing reusable charts in d3. d4 also follows the general update pattern too.

There are hundreds of nice charting libraries already out there, but they are either: not responsive use the wrong technologies for illustration (canvas) are not flexible enough while keeping the configuration simple are not friendly to your own code are not friendly to designers have unnecessary dependencies to monolithic libraries more annoying things That's why we started Chartist.js and our goal is to solve all of the above issues. What is it made for? Chartist's goal is to provide a simple, lightweight and unintrusive library to responsively craft charts on your website. It's important to understand that one of the main intentions of Chartist.js is to rely on standards rather than providing it's own solution to a problem which is already solved by those standards. We need to leverage the power of browsers today and say good bye to the idea of solving all problems ourselves. Chartist works with inline-SVG and therefore leverages the power of the DOM to provide parts of its functionality. This also means that Chartist does not provide it's own event handling, labels, behaviors or anything else that can just be done with plain HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The single and only responsibility of Chartist is to help you drawing ""Simple responsive Charts"" using inline-SVG in the DOM, CSS to style and JavaScript to provide an API for configuring your charts. Example site You can visit this Site http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/ which is in fact a build of the current project. We are still developing and constantly add features but you can already use Chartist.js in your projects as we have reached a stable and reliable state already. Version notes We are currently still heavily developing in order to make Chartist.js better. Your help is needed! Please contribute to the project if you like the idea and the concept and help us to bring nice looking responsive open-source charts to the masses. Important missing stuff Jasmine Tests! Documentation: JSDoc, Getting started documentation and landing page Better accessibility using ARIA and other optimizations Better interfaces to the library (i.e. jQuery with data-* attributes for configuration), Angular.js directive etc. Richer Sass / CSS framework Other charts types (spider etc.) Plugins Some features aren't right for the core product but there is a great set of plugins available which add features like: Axis labels Tooltips at data points Coloring above/below a threshold and more. See all the plugins here. Contribution We are looking for people who share the idea of having a simple, flexible charting library that is responsive and uses modern and future-proof technologies. The goal of this project is to create a responsive charting library where developers have their joy in using it and designers love it because of the designing flexibility they have.

It focuses on two different aspects of visualization programming: basic charts for creating historical reports, and real-time charts for displaying frequently updating timeseries data. To get started using Epoch, please refer to the Epoch Project Site. There you can find full documentation and guides to help you start using Epoch right away. Installation Epoch can be easily installed via the following package managers: npm bower packagist If you don't see your favorite package manager in the list above feel free to open up an issue and let us know. Finally, you can download any release of the library from the project releases page. Important: Epoch requires d3. In order to work properly your page must load d3 before epoch. Public CDN URLs If you don't want to host the files yourself, you can use jsDelivr to serve the files: Visit epoch page on jsDelvr. Copy the provided URL's and link to them in your project. Developing Epoch Developing Epoch is a reasonably straight forward process. In this section we'll cover the basic on how to develop Epoch by detailing common build task, exploring how the source is arranged, and finally show how to use rendering tests to aid development. Configuring Development Environment Epoch requires the following for development: Node.js (v4.1.1+) NPM (v2.1.0+) Once both are installed on your machine you will need to run npm install from the repository's root directory in order to install the npm packages required to develop epoch. Once you have installed the required npm packages you can use gulp build to fully rebuild the source (see more information about gulp tasks below). Basic Development Process The best way to start contributing to Epoch is to follow these steps: Change to the source directory for the project Run gulp watch to recompile the project after source files change Make changes in a source file (either in src/ or sass/) In a web browser open the test/index.html and browse the rendering tests Use the rendering tests to see if your changes had the desired result Ensure unit tests with pass npm test Testing Epoch uses two types of testing to ensure that changes do not cause unintended side effects. The first, unit tests, ensure that the core functional components of the library work as expected. The second, rendering tests, allow you to ensure that charts and graphs are correctly rendered. It is important to keep both unit test and rendering tests up-to-date! When developing, use the following guidelines: When adding new features make sure to add new tests When changing existing functionality, ensure that the appropriate both types of tests still pass If you want to make a new type of chart, add a whole new test suite for that chart! Keeping the tests current makes it easier for others to review your code and spot issues. Also, pull requests without appropriate testing will not be merged. Gulp Tasks Epoch uses gulp to perform various tasks. The gulpfile.js file defines the following tasks: gulp clean - Cleans the dist/ directory. gulp build - Builds the CoffeeScript and Sass source into the dist/ directory. gulp watch - Starts a watch script to recompile CoffeeScript and Sass when any files change. Source Structure The directory structure for the Epoch project follows some basic guidelines, here's an overview of how it is structured: dist/                  - Compiled JavaScript and CSS source src/                   - Main source directory   core/                - Core Epoch Library Files     util.coffee        - Library Utility Routines     d3.coffee          - d3 Extensions     format.coffee      - Data formatters     chart.coffee       - Base Chart Classes     css.coffee         - CSS Querying Engine   adapters/            - 3rd Party Library Adapters (currently only jQuery)   basic/               - Basic Chart Classes   time/                - Real-time Chart Classes   adapters.coffee      - Options / Global Classes for Adapter Implementations   basic.coffee         - Base Classes for Basic Charts   data.coffee          - Data Formatting   epoch.coffee         - Main source file, defines name spaces, etc.   model.coffee         - Data Model   time.coffee          - Base Classes for Real-Time Charts sass/                  - Scss source for the default epoch stylesheet tests/   render/              - Rendering tests     basic/             - Basic chart rendering tests     real-time/         - Real-time rendering tests   unit/                - Unit tests  Release Checklist Run npm test and ensure all tests pass Run npm version [major|minor|patch] Run npm publish Update CHANGELOG.md with the changes since last release Update the gh-pages branch's library version in _config.yml Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

The new library should work with existing Google Spreadsheets, but not existing TimelineJS JSON files. Knight Lab will continue to serve this version of Timeline from https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/latest/js/timeline-min.js https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/latest/js/timeline.js https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/latest/css/timeline.css However, no future development on this line of code is planned.

Create timelines that are at the same time beautiful and intuitive for users TimelineJS is great for pulling in media from different sources. Just throw in a link from Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, Vimeo, Google Maps or SoundCloud and TimelineJS will format it to fit perfectly. More media types will be supported in the future. Creating one is as easy as filling in a Google spreadsheet or as detailed as JSON. Add it to your site Using Inline (easiest) Place the embed code where you want the timeline to show in the <body> of your site.

The examples above demonstrate how to do this using story-embed.js, which is the simplest way to set up a Timeline of your own. If for some reason you need more fine-grained control over your timeline, load the javascript and CSS files separately. We recommend that you load them from our CDN. <!-- always load the CSS --> <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/latest/css/timeline.css""> <!-- and then one of either --> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/latest/js/timeline.js""></script> <!-- or --> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/latest/js/timeline-min.js""></script> <!-- but no need for both --> If you need to serve copies of the files from your own server, use the entire contents of the ""/build/"" directory of our GitHub repository. If you use a local copy of story-embed.js it should automatically load the other Timeline resources from your server. Config Options Here are some of the options you can set in the config. Source source Should be either the path to the JSON resource to load, or a JavaScript object corresponding to the Timeline model. Here is an example using a data object:     var dataObject = {timeline: {headline: ""Headline"", type: ... }}     createStoryJS({         type:       'timeline',         width:      '800',         height:     '600',         source:     dataObject,         embed_id:   'my-timeline'     }); If source is a string, we will try to automatically recognize resources that are Twitter searches, Google Spreadsheets or Storify stories. Failing that, we assume the source is either JSON or JSONP. If string matches on .jsonp, we will treat it as JSONP, otherwise, we will append ?callback=onJSONP_Data. See more details below.

Remember, JSON is picky. A misplaced comma or quotation mark can prevent the timeline from loading properly. Here is the full model: {     ""timeline"":     {         ""headline"":""The Main Timeline Headline Goes here"",         ""type"":""default"",         ""text"":""<p>Intro body text goes here, some HTML is ok</p>"",         ""asset"": {             ""media"":""http://yourdomain_or_socialmedialink_goes_here.jpg"",             ""credit"":""Credit Name Goes Here"",             ""caption"":""Caption text goes here""         },         ""date"": [             {                 ""startDate"":""2011,12,10,07,02,10"",                 ""endDate"":""2011,12,11,08,11"",                 ""headline"":""Headline Goes Here"",                 ""text"":""<p>Body text goes here, some HTML is OK</p>"",                 ""tag"":""This is Optional"",                 ""classname"":""optionaluniqueclassnamecanbeaddedhere"",                 ""asset"": {                     ""media"":""http://twitter.com/ArjunaSoriano/status/164181156147900416"",                     ""thumbnail"":""optional-32x32px.jpg"",                     ""credit"":""Credit Name Goes Here"",                     ""caption"":""Caption text goes here""                 }             }         ],         ""era"": [             {                 ""startDate"":""2011,12,10"",                 ""endDate"":""2011,12,11"",                 ""headline"":""Headline Goes Here"",                 ""text"":""<p>Body text goes here, some HTML is OK</p>"",                 ""tag"":""This is Optional""             }          ]     } } JSONP : Timeline can use a variation of JSONP to allow you to easily load data across different domains.

It’s as simple as dropping a date, text, and links into the appropriate columns in TimelineJS’s template. You can find the template here: TimelineJS Google Spreadsheet Template There are only a couple things you need to know in order to create a timeline using Google Docs: Make the spreadsheet public: Google Docs are automatically set to private but the spreadsheet must be public. Click the blue “Share” button on the top right-hand corner. In the “Share settings” window, you’ll see the private setting of the spreadsheet: click “Change...”. In the Visibility options window, choose “Public on the Web” and save. Publish to the Web Under the File menu, select “Publish to the Web.” In the next window, check the box next to “Automatically republish when changes are made.” Uncheck all other boxes. Click “start publishing.” This will give you the URL to embed in your HTML file. Copy/paste the Web URL into your TimelineJS HTML file After you publish the spreadsheet, Google Docs will generate a link to the file. Copy the link for the Web Page option (as opposed to PDF, HTML, XLS, etc.), then paste it into the timeline’s HTML file (see Add it to your site ) Storify: Support for Storify is still in its early stages. It works though. Just paste a link to the storify story as the source. Media Included in the zip file is a kitchen sink example. This timeline shows how to incorporate the different media types from different services like Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, Instagram, TwitPic, Wikipedia, Dailymotion, SoundCloud and Vimeo. Just copy and paste the address of the media from the browser bar into the media parameter. TimelineJS will auto-magically pull in the media via their api and format it. Best practices Tips and tricks to best utilize TimelineJS Keep it light - don’t get bogged down by text or other elements Pick stories that have a strong chronological narrative. It does not work well for stories that need to jump around in the timeline. Include events that build up to major occurrences, not just the major events. Don't overwhelm the user. A timeline with hundreds of events is probably not the best use of the format. License This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

Ace is a standalone code editor written in JavaScript. Our goal is to create a browser based editor that matches and extends the features, usability and performance of existing native editors such as TextMate, Vim or Eclipse. It can be easily embedded in any web page or JavaScript application. Ace is developed as the primary editor for Cloud9 IDE and the successor of the Mozilla Skywriter (Bespin) Project. Features Syntax highlighting for over 120 languages (TextMate/Sublime/.tmlanguage files can be imported) Over 20 themes (TextMate/Sublime/.tmtheme files can be imported) Automatic indent and outdent An optional command line Handles huge documents (at last check, 4,000,000 lines is the upper limit) Fully customizable key bindings including vim and Emacs modes Search and replace with regular expressions Highlight matching parentheses Toggle between soft tabs and real tabs Displays hidden characters Drag and drop text using the mouse Line wrapping Code folding Multiple cursors and selections Live syntax checker (currently JavaScript/CoffeeScript/CSS/XQuery) Cut, copy, and paste functionality Take Ace for a spin! Check out the Ace live demo or get a Cloud9 IDE account to experience Ace while editing one of your own GitHub projects. If you want, you can use Ace as a textarea replacement thanks to the Ace Bookmarklet. Embedding Ace Ace can be easily embedded into any existing web page. You can either use one of pre-packaged versions of ace (just copy one of src* subdirectories somewhere into your project), or use requireJS to load contents of lib/ace as ace The easiest version is simply:     <div id=""editor"">some text</div>     <script src=""src/ace.js"" type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8""></script>     <script>         var editor = ace.edit(""editor"");     </script> With ""editor"" being the id of the DOM element, which should be converted to an editor. Note that this element must be explicitly sized and positioned absolute or relative for Ace to work. e.g.     #editor {         position: absolute;         width: 500px;         height: 400px;     } To change the theme simply include the Theme's JavaScript file     <script src=""src/theme-twilight.js"" type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8""></script> and configure the editor to use the theme:     editor.setTheme(""ace/theme/twilight""); By default the editor only supports plain text mode; many other languages are available as separate modules. After including the mode's JavaScript file:     <script src=""src/mode-javascript.js"" type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8""></script> The mode can then be used like this:     var JavaScriptMode = ace.require(""ace/mode/javascript"").Mode;     editor.session.setMode(new JavaScriptMode()); to destroy editor use     editor.destroy();     editor.container.remove(); Documentation Additional usage information, including events to listen to and extending syntax highlighters, can be found on the main Ace website. You can also find API documentation at http://ace.c9.io/#nav=api. Also check out the sample code for the kitchen sink demo app. If you still need help, feel free to drop a mail on the ace mailing list, or at irc.freenode.net#ace. Running Ace After the checkout Ace works out of the box. No build step is required. To try it out, simply start the bundled mini HTTP server using Node.JS     node ./static.js The editor can then be opened at http://localhost:8888/kitchen-sink.html. To open the editor with a file:/// URL see the wiki. Building Ace You do not generally need to build ACE. The ace-builds repository endeavours to maintain the latest build, and you can just copy one of src* subdirectories somewhere into your project. However, all you need is Node.js and npm installed to package ACE. Just run npm install in the ace folder to install dependencies:     npm install     node ./Makefile.dryice.js To package Ace, we use the dryice build tool developed by the Mozilla Skywriter team. Call node Makefile.dryice.js on the command-line to start the packing. This build script accepts the following options -m                 minify build files with uglify-js           -nc                namespace require and define calls with ""ace"" -bm                builds the bookmarklet version --target ./path    specify relative path for output folder (default value is ""./build"") To generate all the files in the ace-builds repository, run node Makefile.dryice.js full --target ../ace-builds Running the Unit Tests The Ace unit tests can run on node.js. Assuming you have already done npm install, just call:     node lib/ace/test/all.js You can also run the tests in your browser by serving: http://localhost:8888/lib/ace/test/tests.html  This makes debugging failing tests way more easier. Contributing Ace is a community project and wouldn't be what it is without contributions! We actively encourage and support contributions. The Ace source code is released under the BSD License. This license is very simple, and is friendly to all kinds of projects, whether open source or not. Take charge of your editor and add your favorite language highlighting and keybindings!

MediumEditor has been written using vanilla JavaScript, no additional frameworks required. Browser Support Basic usage demo: http://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/ Installation Via npm: Run in your console: npm install medium-editor Via bower: bower install medium-editor Via an external CDN Using jsDelivr. For the latest version: <script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/medium-editor/latest/js/medium-editor.min.js""></script> <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/medium-editor/latest/css/medium-editor.min.css"" type=""text/css"" media=""screen"" charset=""utf-8""> For a custom one: <script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/medium-editor/4.11.1/js/medium-editor.min.js""></script> <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/medium-editor/4.11.1/css/medium-editor.min.css"" type=""text/css"" media=""screen"" charset=""utf-8""> Using CDNJS. Manual installation: Download the latest release and attach medium editor's stylesheets to your page: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/medium-editor.css""> <!-- Core --> <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/themes/default.css""> <!-- or any other theme --> Usage The next step is to reference the editor's script <script src=""js/medium-editor.js""></script> You can now instantiate a new MediumEditor object: <script>var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable');</script> The above code will transform all the elements with the .editable class into HTML5 editable contents and add the medium editor toolbar to them. You can also pass a list of HTML elements: var elements = document.querySelectorAll('.editable'),     editor = new MediumEditor(elements); MediumEditor also supports textarea. If you provide a textarea element, the script will create a new div with contentEditable=true, hide the textarea and link the textarea value to the div HTML content. Integrating with various frameworks People have contributed wrappers around MediumEditor for integrating with different frameworks and tech stacks. Take a look at the list of existing Wrappers and Integrations that have already been written for MediumEditor! MediumEditor Options View the MediumEditor Options documentation on all the various options for MediumEditor. Options to customize medium-editor are passed as the second argument to the MediumEditor constructor. Example: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editor', {     // options go here }); Core options activeButtonClass: CSS class added to active buttons in the toolbar. Default: 'medium-editor-button-active' buttonLabels: type of labels on the buttons. Values: false | 'fontawesome'. Default: false NOTE: Using 'fontawesome' as the buttonLabels requires version 4.1.0 of the fontawesome css to be on the page to ensure all icons will be displayed correctly delay: time in milliseconds to show the toolbar or anchor tag preview. Default: 0 disableReturn: enables/disables the use of the return-key. You can also set specific element behavior by using setting a data-disable-return attribute. Default: false disableDoubleReturn: allows/disallows two (or more) empty new lines. You can also set specific element behavior by using setting a data-disable-double-return attribute. Default: false disableExtraSpaces: when set to true, it disallows spaces at the beginning and end of the element. Also it disallows entering 2 consecutive spaces between 2 words. Default: false disableEditing: enables/disables adding the contenteditable behavior. Useful for using the toolbar with customized buttons/actions. You can also set specific element behavior by using setting a data-disable-editing attribute. Default: false elementsContainer: specifies a DOM node to contain MediumEditor's toolbar and anchor preview elements. Default: document.body extensions: extension to use (see Custom Buttons and Extensions) for more. Default: {} spellcheck: Enable/disable native contentEditable automatic spellcheck. Default: true targetBlank: enables/disables target=""_blank"" for anchor tags. Default: false Toolbar options The toolbar for MediumEditor is implemented as a built-in extension which automatically displays whenever the user selects some text. The toolbar can hold any set of defined built-in buttons, but can also hold any custom buttons passed in as extensions. Options for the toolbar are passed as an object that is a member of the outer options object. Example: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     toolbar: {         /* These are the default options for the toolbar,            if nothing is passed this is what is used */         allowMultiParagraphSelection: true,         buttons: ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'anchor', 'h2', 'h3', 'quote'],         diffLeft: 0,         diffTop: -10,         firstButtonClass: 'medium-editor-button-first',         lastButtonClass: 'medium-editor-button-last',         relativeContainer: null,         standardizeSelectionStart: false,         static: false,         /* options which only apply when static is true */         align: 'center',         sticky: false,         updateOnEmptySelection: false     } }); allowMultiParagraphSelection: enables/disables whether the toolbar should be displayed when selecting multiple paragraphs/block elements. Default: true buttons: the set of buttons to display on the toolbar. Default: ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'anchor', 'h2', 'h3', 'quote'] See Button Options for details on more button options diffLeft: value in pixels to be added to the X axis positioning of the toolbar. Default: 0 diffTop: value in pixels to be added to the Y axis positioning of the toolbar. Default: -10 firstButtonClass: CSS class added to the first button in the toolbar. Default: 'medium-editor-button-first' lastButtonClass: CSS class added to the last button in the toolbar. Default: 'medium-editor-button-last' relativeContainer: DOMElement to append the toolbar to instead of the body. When passed, the toolbar will also be positioned relative instead of absolute. Default: null standardizeSelectionStart: enables/disables standardizing how the beginning of a range is decided between browsers whenever the selected text is analyzed for updating toolbar buttons status. Default: false static: enable/disable the toolbar always displaying in the same location relative to the medium-editor element. Default: false Options which only apply when the static option is being used: align: left|center|right - When the static option is true, this aligns the static toolbar relative to the medium-editor element. Default: center sticky: When the static option is true, this enables/disables the toolbar ""sticking"" to the viewport and staying visible on the screen while the page scrolls. Default: false updateOnEmptySelection: When the static option is true, this enables/disables updating the state of the toolbar buttons even when the selection is collapsed (there is no selection, just a cursor). Default: false To disable the toolbar (which also disables the anchor-preview extension), set the value of the toolbar option to false: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     toolbar: false }); Button Options Button behavior can be modified by passing an object into the buttons array instead of a string. This allow for overriding some of the default behavior of buttons. The following options are some of the basic parts of buttons that you may override, but any part of the MediumEditor.Extension.prototype can be overridden via these button options. (Check out the source code for buttons to see what all can be overridden). name: name of the button being overridden action: argument to pass to MediumEditor.execAction() when the button is clicked. aria: value to add as the aria-label attribute of the button element displayed in the toolbar. This is also used as the tooltip for the button. tagNames: array of element tag names that would indicate that this button has already been applied. If this action has already been applied, the button will be displayed as 'active' in the toolbar. Example: For 'bold', if the text is ever within a <b> or <strong> tag that indicates the text is already bold. So the array of tagNames for bold would be: ['b', 'strong'] NOTE: This is not used if useQueryState is set to true. style: A pair of css property & value(s) that indicate that this button has already been applied. If this action has already been applied, the button will be displayed as 'active' in the toolbar. Example: For 'bold', if the text is ever within an element with a 'font-weight' style property set to 700 or 'bold', that indicates the text is already bold. So the style object for bold would be { prop: 'font-weight', value: '700|bold' } NOTE: This is not used if useQueryState is set to true. Properties of the style object: prop: name of the css property value: value(s) of the css property (multiple values can be separated by a '|') useQueryState: Enables/disables whether this button should use the built-in document.queryCommandState() method to determine whether the action has already been applied. If the action has already been applied, the button will be displayed as 'active' in the toolbar Example: For 'bold', if this is set to true, the code will call document.queryCommandState('bold') which will return true if the browser thinks the text is already bold, and false otherwise contentDefault: Default innerHTML to put inside the button contentFA: The innerHTML to use for the content of the button if the buttonLabels option for MediumEditor is set to 'fontawesome' classList: An array of classNames (strings) to be added to the button attrs: A set of key-value pairs to add to the button as custom attributes to the button element. Example of overriding buttons (here, the goal is to mimic medium by having H1 and H2 buttons which actually produce <h2> and <h3> tags respectively): var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     toolbar: {         buttons: [             'bold',             'italic',             {                 name: 'h1',                 action: 'append-h2',                 aria: 'header type 1',                 tagNames: ['h2'],                 contentDefault: '<b>H1</b>',                 classList: ['custom-class-h1'],                 attrs: {                     'data-custom-attr': 'attr-value-h1'                 }             },             {                 name: 'h2',                 action: 'append-h3',                 aria: 'header type 2',                 tagNames: ['h3'],                 contentDefault: '<b>H2</b>',                 classList: ['custom-class-h2'],                 attrs: {                     'data-custom-attr': 'attr-value-h2'                 }             },             'justifyCenter',             'quote',             'anchor'         ]     } }); Anchor Preview options The anchor preview is a built-in extension which automatically displays a 'tooltip' when the user is hovering over a link in the editor. The tooltip will display the href of the link, and when click, will open the anchor editing form in the toolbar. Options for the anchor preview 'tooltip' are passed as an object that is a member of the outer options object. Example: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     anchorPreview: {         /* These are the default options for anchor preview,            if nothing is passed this is what it used */         hideDelay: 500,         previewValueSelector: 'a'     } } }); hideDelay: time in milliseconds to show the anchor tag preview after the mouse has left the anchor tag. Default: 500 previewValueSelector: the default selector to locate where to put the activeAnchor value in the preview. You should only need to override this if you've modified the way in which the anchor-preview extension renders. Default: 'a' showWhenToolbarIsVisible: determines whether the anchor tag preview shows up when the toolbar is visible. You should set this value to true if the static option for the toolbar is true and you want the preview to show at the same time. Default: false showOnEmptyLinks: determines whether the anchor tag preview shows up on link with href as '' or '#something'. You should set this value to false if you do not want the preview to show up in such use cases. Default: true To disable the anchor preview, set the value of the anchorPreview option to false: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     anchorPreview: false }); NOTE: If the toolbar is disabled (via toolbar: false option or data-disable-toolbar attribute) the anchor-preview is automatically disabled. If the anchor editing form is not enabled, clicking on the anchor-preview will not allow the href of the link to be edited Placeholder Options The placeholder handler is a built-in extension which displays placeholder text when the editor is empty. Options for placeholder are passed as an object that is a member of the outer options object. Example: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     placeholder: {         /* This example includes the default options for placeholder,            if nothing is passed this is what it used */         text: 'Type your text',         hideOnClick: true     } }); text: Defines the default placeholder for empty contenteditables when placeholder is not set to false. You can overwrite it by setting a data-placeholder attribute on the editor elements. Default: 'Type your text' hideOnClick: Causes the placeholder to disappear as soon as the field gains focus. Default: true. To hide the placeholder only after starting to type, and to show it again as soon as field is empty, set this option to false. To disable the placeholder, set the value of the placeholder option to false: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     placeholder: false }); Anchor Form options The anchor form is a built-in button extension which allows the user to add/edit/remove links from within the editor. When 'anchor' is passed in as a button in the list of buttons, this extension will be enabled and can be triggered by clicking the corresponding button in the toolbar. Options for the anchor form are passed as an object that is a member of the outer options object. Example: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     toolbar: {         buttons: ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'anchor']     },     anchor: {         /* These are the default options for anchor form,            if nothing is passed this is what it used */         customClassOption: null,         customClassOptionText: 'Button',         linkValidation: false,         placeholderText: 'Paste or type a link',         targetCheckbox: false,         targetCheckboxText: 'Open in new window'     } } }); customClassOption: custom class name the user can optionally have added to their created links (ie 'button'). If passed as a non-empty string, a checkbox will be displayed allowing the user to choose whether to have the class added to the created link or not. Default: null customClassOptionText: text to be shown in the checkbox when the customClassOption is being used. Default: 'Button' linkValidation: enables/disables check for common URL protocols on anchor links. Converts invalid url characters (ie spaces) to valid characters using encodeURI. Default: false placeholderText: text to be shown as placeholder of the anchor input. Default: 'Paste or type a link' targetCheckbox: enables/disables displaying a ""Open in new window"" checkbox, which when checked changes the target attribute of the created link. Default: false targetCheckboxText: text to be shown in the checkbox enabled via the targetCheckbox option. Default: 'Open in new window' Paste Options The paste handler is a built-in extension which attempts to filter the content when the user pastes. How the paste handler filters is configurable via specific options. Options for paste handling are passed as an object that is a member of the outer options object. Example: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     paste: {         /* This example includes the default options for paste,            if nothing is passed this is what it used */         forcePlainText: true,         cleanPastedHTML: false,         cleanReplacements: [],         cleanAttrs: ['class', 'style', 'dir'],         cleanTags: ['meta']     } }); forcePlainText: Forces pasting as plain text. Default: true cleanPastedHTML: cleans pasted content from different sources, like google docs etc. Default: false preCleanReplacements: custom pairs (2 element arrays) of RegExp and replacement text to use during paste when forcePlainText or cleanPastedHTML are true OR when calling cleanPaste(text) helper method. These replacements are executed before builtin replacements. Default: [] cleanReplacements: custom pairs (2 element arrays) of RegExp and replacement text to use during paste when forcePlainText or cleanPastedHTML are true OR when calling cleanPaste(text) helper method. These replacements are executed after builtin replacements. Default: [] cleanAttrs: list of element attributes to remove during paste when cleanPastedHTML is true or when calling cleanPaste(text) or pasteHTML(html,options) helper methods. Default: ['class', 'style', 'dir'] cleanTags: list of element tag names to remove during paste when cleanPastedHTML is true or when calling cleanPaste(text) or pasteHTML(html,options) helper methods. Default: ['meta'] KeyboardCommands Options The keyboard commands handler is a built-in extension for mapping key-combinations to actions to execute in the editor. Options for KeyboardCommands are passed as an object that is a member of the outer options object. Example: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     keyboardCommands: {         /* This example includes the default options for keyboardCommands,            if nothing is passed this is what it used */         commands: [             {                 command: 'bold',                 key: 'B',                 meta: true,                 shift: false,                 alt: false             },             {                 command: 'italic',                 key: 'I',                 meta: true,                 shift: false,                 alt: false             },             {                 command: 'underline',                 key: 'U',                 meta: true,                 shift: false,                 alt: false             }         ],     } }); commands: Array of objects describing each command and the combination of keys that will trigger it. Required for each object: command: argument passed to editor.execAction() when key-combination is used if defined as false, the shortcut will be disabled key: keyboard character that triggers this command meta: whether the ctrl/meta key has to be active or inactive shift: whether the shift key has to be active or inactive alt: whether the alt key has to be active or inactive To disable the keyboard commands, set the value of the keyboardCommands option to false: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     keyboardCommands: false }); Auto Link Options The auto-link handler is a built-in extension which automatically turns URLs entered into the text field into HTML anchor tags (similar to the functionality of Markdown). This feature is OFF by default. To enable built-in auto-link support, set the value of the autoLink option to true: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     autoLink: true }); Image Dragging Options The image dragging handler is a built-in extension for handling dragging & dropping images into the contenteditable. This feature is ON by default. To disable built-in image dragging, set the value of the imageDragging option to false: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     imageDragging: false }); Disable File Dragging To stop preventing drag & drop events and disable file dragging in general, provide a dummy ImageDragging extension. var editor = new MediumEditor('.editor', {     extensions: {         'imageDragging': {}     } }); Due to the state of code in 5.0.0, the editor ALWAYS prevented any drag and drop actions. We will have a better way to disable file dragging in 6.* Options Example: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable', {     delay: 1000,     targetBlank: true,     toolbar: {         buttons: ['bold', 'italic', 'quote'],         diffLeft: 25,         diffTop: 10,     },     anchor: {         placeholderText: 'Type a link',         customClassOption: 'btn',         customClassOptionText: 'Create Button'     },     paste: {         cleanPastedHTML: true,         cleanAttrs: ['style', 'dir'],         cleanTags: ['label', 'meta']     },     anchorPreview: {         hideDelay: 300     },     placeholder: {         text: 'Click to edit'     } }); Buttons By default, MediumEditor supports buttons for most of the commands for document.execCommand() that are well-supported across all its supported browsers. Default buttons. MediumEditor, by default, will show only the buttons listed here to avoid a huge toolbar: bold italic underline anchor (built-in support for collecting a url via the anchor extension) h2 h3 quote All buttons. These are all the built-in buttons supported by MediumEditor. bold italic underline strikethrough subscript superscript anchor image (this simply converts selected text to an image tag) quote pre orderedlist unorderedlist indent (moves the selected text up one level) outdent (moves the selected text down one level) justifyLeft justifyCenter justifyRight justifyFull h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 removeFormat (clears inline style formatting, preserves blocks) Themes Check out the Wiki page for a list of available themes: https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor/wiki/Themes API View the MediumEditor Object API documentation on the Wiki for details on all the methods supported on the MediumEditor object. Initialization methods MediumEditor(elements, options): Creates an instance of MediumEditor .destroy(): tears down the editor if already setup, removing all DOM elements and event handlers .setup(): rebuilds the editor if it has already been destroyed, recreating DOM elements and attaching event handlers .addElements(): add elements to an already initialized instance of MediumEditor .removeElements(): remove elements from an already initialized instance of MediumEditor Event Methods .on(target, event, listener, useCapture): attach a listener to a DOM event which will be detached when MediumEditor is deactivated .off(target, event, listener, useCapture): detach a listener to a DOM event that was attached via on() .subscribe(event, listener): attaches a listener to a custom medium-editor event .unsubscribe(event, listener): detaches a listener from a custom medium-editor event .trigger(name, data, editable): manually triggers a custom medium-editor event Selection Methods .checkSelection(): manually trigger an update of the toolbar and extensions based on the current selection .exportSelection(): return a data representation of the selected text, which can be applied via importSelection() .importSelection(selectionState): restore the selection using a data representation of previously selected text (ie value returned by exportSelection()) .getFocusedElement(): returns an element if any contenteditable element monitored by MediumEditor currently has focused .getSelectedParentElement(range): get the parent contenteditable element that contains the current selection .restoreSelection(): restore the selection to what was selected when saveSelection() was called .saveSelection(): internally store the set of selected text .selectAllContents(): expands the selection to contain all text within the focused contenteditable .selectElement(element): change selection to be a specific element and update the toolbar to reflect the selection .stopSelectionUpdates(): stop the toolbar from updating to reflect the state of the selected text .startSelectionUpdates(): put the toolbar back into its normal updating state Editor Action Methods .cleanPaste(text): convert text to plaintext and replace current selection with result .createLink(opts): creates a link via the native document.execCommand('createLink') command .execAction(action, opts): executes an built-in action via document.execCommand .pasteHTML(html, options): replace the current selection with html .queryCommandState(action): wrapper around the browser's built in document.queryCommandState(action) for checking whether a specific action has already been applied to the selection. Helper Methods .delay(fn): delay any function from being executed by the amount of time passed as the delay option .getContent(index): gets the trimmed innerHTML of the element at index .getExtensionByName(name): get a reference to an extension with the specified name .resetContent(element): reset the content of all elements or a specific element to its value when added to the editor initially .serialize(): returns a JSON object with elements contents .setContent(html, index): sets the innerHTML to html of the element at index Static Methods/Properties .getEditorFromElement(element): retrieve the instance of MediumEditor that is monitoring the provided editor element .version: the version information for the MediumEditor library Dynamically add/remove elements to your instance It is possible to dynamically add new elements to your existing MediumEditor instance: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable'); editor.subscribe('editableInput', this._handleEditableInput.bind(this));  // imagine an ajax fetch/any other dynamic functionality which will add new '.editable' elements to the DOM  editor.addElements('.editable'); // OR editor.addElements(document.getElementsByClassName('editable')); // OR editor.addElements(document.querySelectorAll('.editable')); Passing an elements or array of elements to addElements(elements) will: Add the given element or array of elements to the internal this.elements array. Ensure the element(s) are initialized with the proper attributes and event handlers as if the element had been passed during instantiation of the editor. For any <textarea> elements: Hide the <textarea> Create a new <div contenteditable=true> element and add it to the elements array. Ensure the 2 elements remain sync'd. Be intelligent enough to run the necessary code only once per element, no matter how often you will call it. Removing elements dynamically Straight forward, just call removeElements with the element or array of elements you to want to tear down. Each element itself will remain a contenteditable - it will just remove all event handlers and all references to it so you can safely remove it from DOM. editor.removeElements(document.querySelector('#myElement')); // OR editor.removeElements(document.getElementById('myElement')); // OR editor.removeElements('#myElement');  // in case you have jQuery and don't exactly know when an element was removed, for example after routing state change var removedElements = []; editor.elements.forEach(function (element) {     // check if the element is still available in current DOM     if (!$(element).parents('body').length) {         removedElements.push(element);     } });  editor.removeElements(removedElements); Capturing DOM changes For observing any changes on contentEditable, use the custom 'editableInput' event exposed via the subscribe() method: var editor = new MediumEditor('.editable'); editor.subscribe('editableInput', function (event, editable) {     // Do some work }); This event is supported in all browsers supported by MediumEditor (including IE9+ and Edge)! To help with cases when one instance of MediumEditor is monitoring multiple elements, the 2nd argument passed to the event handler (editable in the example above) will be a reference to the contenteditable element that has actually changed. This is handy when you need to capture any modifications to the contenteditable element including: Typing Cutting/Pasting Changes from clicking on buttons in the toolbar Undo/Redo Why is this interesting and why should you use this event instead of just attaching to the input event on the contenteditable element? So for most modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), the input event works just fine. In fact, editableInput is just a proxy for the input event in those browsers. However, the input event is not supported for contenteditable elements in IE 9-11 and is mostly supported in Microsoft Edge, but not fully. So, to properly support the editableInput event in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge, MediumEditor uses a combination of the selectionchange and keypress events, as well as monitoring calls to document.execCommand.

The value of each property will be used as the title attribute on the icon. Most browsers will display the title attribute as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the icon. options.title = {     'blockquote': 'Blockquote'     'createlink': 'Hyperlink'     'insertimage': 'Image' } If you are using Bootstrap or jQueryUI, you can standardize the tooltip style by adding $('i.pen-icon').tooltip() to your JavaScript. 2.6 Prevent unsafe page redirect By default, Pen will prevent unsafe page redirect when editing, to shut down it, specific options.stay to false. NOTE: if defaults.debug is set to true and default.stay is not set: defaults.stay == !defaults.debug. 2.7 Disable and Re-enable editor You can disable the pen editor by call destroy() method of the var pen = new Pen(options) object. like: var pen = new Pen('#editor');  pen.destroy(); // return itself And, there's a corresponding method called rebuild() to re-enable the editor: pen.rebuild(); // return itself 2.8 Export content as markdown It's an experimental feature var pen = new Pen('#editor');  pen.toMd(); // return a markdown string 3. markdown syntax support 3.1 install The syntax convertor will be enabled automatically by linking markdown.js after `pen.js: <script src=""src/pen.js""></script> <script src=""src/markdown.js""></script> 3.2 usage To use it, you can type action cmd + space key at a line start. like: ### This will create a h3 tag  The following cmds are allowed: Headings: type 1~6 # at the line start Unordered List: type - or * Ordered List: type 1.

Instead, submit it to https://github.com/steveathon/bootstrap-wysiwyg Although this is the original repository, we need the project to be tiny and focused on the needs of the MindMup tool, which means that we do not want to complicate it with all the various bits and pieces needed for other usages and older browsers. Meanwhile, Steve was kind enough to create a fork, backport it to older browsers, extend and integrate all kinds of changes. Steve's fork does not need to stay small, slim and focused, so please use his repo for all your needs if this plugin does provide out of the box About the editor Tiny bootstrap-compatible WISWYG rich text editor, based on browser execCommand, built originally for MindMup. Here are the key features: Automatically binds standard hotkeys for common operations on Mac and Windows Drag and drop files to insert images, support image upload (also taking photos on mobile devices) Allows a custom built toolbar, no magic markup generators, enabling the web site to use all the goodness of Bootstrap, Font Awesome and so on... Does not force any styling - it's all up to you Uses standard browser features, no magic non-standard code, toolbar and keyboard configurable to execute any supported browser command Does not create a separate frame, backup text areas etc - instead keeps it simple and runs everything inline in a DIV (Optionally) cleans up trailing whitespace and empty divs and spans Requires a modern browser (tested in Chrome 26, Firefox 19, Safari 6) Supports mobile devices (tested on IOS 6 Ipad/Iphone and Android 4.1.1 Chrome) Basic Usage See http://mindmup.github.com/bootstrap-wysiwyg/ Customising You can assign commands to hotkeys and toolbar links. For a toolbar link, just put the execCommand command name into a data-edit attribute. For more info on execCommand, see http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/execCommand.html and https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Rich-Text_Editing_in_Mozilla <div class=""btn-toolbar"" data-role=""editor-toolbar"" data-target=""#editor"">   <a class=""btn btn-large"" data-edit=""bold""><i class=""icon-bold""></i></a> </div> To pass arguments to a command, separate a command with a space.   <a data-edit=""fontName Arial"">...</a> You can also use input type='text' with a data-edit attribute. When the value is changed, the command from the data-edit attribute will be applied using the input value as the command argument <input type=""text"" data-edit=""createLink""> If the input type is file, when a file is selected the contents will be read in using the FileReader API and the data URL will be used as the argument <input type=""file"" data-edit=""insertImage""> To change hotkeys, specify the map of hotkeys to commands in the hotKeys option. For example: $('#editor').wysiwyg({   hotKeys: {     'ctrl+b meta+b': 'bold',     'ctrl+i meta+i': 'italic',     'ctrl+u meta+u': 'underline',     'ctrl+z meta+z': 'undo',     'ctrl+y meta+y meta+shift+z': 'redo'   } }); Styling for mobile devices This editor should work pretty well with mobile devices, but you'll need to consider the following things when styling it: keyboards on mobile devices take a huge part of the screen having to scroll the screen to touch the toolbar can cause the editing component to lose focus, and the mobile device keyboard might go away mobile devices tend to move the screen viewport around to ensure that the focused element is shown, so it's best that the edit box is glued to the top For the content attachment editor on MindMup, we apply the following rules to mobile device styling: edit box is glued to the top, so the focus doesn't jump around toolbar is below the edit box on portrait screens, edit box size is 50% of the screen on landscape screens, edit box size is 30% of the screen as the screen gets smaller, non-critical toolbar buttons get hidden into a ""other"" menu Dependencies jQuery http://jquery.com/ jQuery HotKeys https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys Bootstrap http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

There are four versions for each release — standard-all, basic, standard, and full. They differ in the number of plugins that are compiled into the main ckeditor.js file as well as the toolbar configuration. See the comparison of the basic, standard, and full installation presets for more details. The standard-all build includes all official CKSource plugins with only those from the standard installation preset compiled into the ckeditor.js file and enabled in the configuration. All versions available in this repository were built using CKBuilder, so they are optimized and ready to be used in a production environment. Documentation Developer documentation for CKEditor is available online at: http://docs.ckeditor.com. Installation Git clone To install one of the available releases, just clone this repository and switch to the respective branch (see next section): git clone -b <release branch> git://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-releases.git  Git submodule If you are using git for your project and you want to integrate CKEditor, we recommend to add this repository as a submodule. git submodule add -b <release branch> git://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-releases.git <clone dir> git commit -m ""Added CKEditor submodule in <clone dir> directory.""  Using Package Managers See the Installing CKEditor with Package Managers article for more details about installing CKEditor with Bower, Composer and npm. Repository Structure Branches This repository contains the following branches: master and latest – the latest release of the standard-all preset (including betas). stable – the latest stable release of the standard-all preset (non-beta). A.B.x (e.g. 4.3.x) – the latest release of the standard-all preset in the A.B branch. (basic|standard|full)/stable – the latest stable release tag point (non-beta). (basic|standard|full)/latest – the latest release tag point (including betas). (basic|standard|full)/A.B.x (e.g. basic/4.0.x) – the latest releases in the A.B branch. Tags Since version 4.3.3 this repository uses the following tag naming rules: x.y.z – contains the standard-all editor build, e.g. 4.3.3, 4.4.0 etc. (basic|standard|full)/x.y.z – contains the editor build with a given preset, e.g. basic/4.3.3. The version numbers follow the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 scheme. Up to version 4.3.2 the tags were released in the following form x.y[.z]/(basic|standard|full). For example: 4.0/basic, 4.0.1/standard. This convention was changed in CKEditor 4.3.3 to conform to the Semantic Versioning scheme. Checking Your Installation The editor comes with a sample page that can be used to verify if the installation succeeded. Take a look at the samples directory.

NOTICE: @NextStepWebs has created an improved markdown editor based on this project Overview Editor is not a WYSIWYG editor, it is a plain text markdown editor. Thanks for the great project codemirror, without which editor can never be created. Basic Usage The easiest way to use Editor is to simply load the script and stylesheet: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""http://lab.lepture.com/editor/editor.css"" /> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://lab.lepture.com/editor/editor.js""></script> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://lab.lepture.com/editor/marked.js""></script> You can also use jsdelivr CDN: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/editor/0.1.0/editor.css""> <script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/editor/0.1.0/editor.js""></script> <script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/editor/0.1.0/marked.js""></script> Having done this, an editor instance can be created: var editor = new Editor(); editor.render(); The editor will take the position of the first <textarea> element. Get the content To get back the edited content you use: editor.codemirror.getValue(); Component If you are using component, you can install it with: $ component install lepture/editor  Seajs If you are using seajs, you can install it with: $ spm install lepture/editor  Development You can build the dist files with grunt. After this repo is cloned, dig into the repo, and install everything you need: $ npm install $ npm install grunt-cli -g  Now you can create the dist files: $ grunt transport  You can get everything you need in the build directory. Configuration The Editor Class accepts an option as the parameter. The supported options are: element (DOM) The element of the textarea. The default value is the first <textarea>. tools (array or false) If set false, the editor will have no toolbar. status (array or false) If set false, the editor will have no statusbar. actions (object) shortcuts (object) Example: new Editor({   element: document.getElementById('editor'),   toolbar: [] }) Contributing Contribution is welcome.

Feb 21, 2016 README.md An Embeddable JavaScript Markdown Editor EpicEditor is an embeddable JavaScript Markdown editor with split fullscreen editing, live previewing, automatic draft saving, offline support, and more. For developers, it offers a robust API, can be easily themed, and allows you to swap out the bundled Markdown parser with anything you throw at it. Why Because, WYSIWYGs suck. Markdown is quickly becoming the replacement. GitHub, Stackoverflow, and even blogging apps like Posterous are now supporting Markdown. EpicEditor allows you to create a Markdown editor with a single line of JavaScript: var editor = new EpicEditor().load(); Quick Start EpicEditor is easy to implement. Add the script and assets to your page, provide a target container and call load(). Step 1: Download Download the latest release or clone the repo: $ git clone git@github.com:OscarGodson/EpicEditor Step 2: Install Copy EpicEditor/epiceditor/ onto your webserver, for example to /static/lib/epiceditor. $ scp -r EpicEditor/epiceditor you@webserver:public_html/static/lib/ You can of course customize this step for your directory layout. Step 3: Create your container element <div id=""epiceditor""></div> Alternately, wrap an existing textarea to load the contents into the EpicEditor instance. <div id=""epiceditor""><textarea id=""my-edit-area""></textarea></div> Step 4: Add the epiceditor.js file <script src=""/static/lib/epiceditor/js/epiceditor.min.js""></script> Step 5: Init EpicEditor EpicEditor needs to know where to find its themes, so it needs to be told its install directory at init. var editor = new EpicEditor({basePath: '/static/lib/epiceditor'}).load(); API EpicEditor([options]) The EpicEditor constructor creates a new editor instance. Customize the instance by passing the options parameter. The example below uses all options and their defaults: var opts = {   container: 'epiceditor',   textarea: null,   basePath: 'epiceditor',   clientSideStorage: true,   localStorageName: 'epiceditor',   useNativeFullscreen: true,   parser: marked,   file: {     name: 'epiceditor',     defaultContent: '',     autoSave: 100   },   theme: {     base: '/themes/base/epiceditor.css',     preview: '/themes/preview/preview-dark.css',     editor: '/themes/editor/epic-dark.css'   },   button: {     preview: true,     fullscreen: true,     bar: ""auto""   },   focusOnLoad: false,   shortcut: {     modifier: 18,     fullscreen: 70,     preview: 80   },   string: {     togglePreview: 'Toggle Preview Mode',     toggleEdit: 'Toggle Edit Mode',     toggleFullscreen: 'Enter Fullscreen'   },   autogrow: false } var editor = new EpicEditor(opts); Options Option Description Default container The ID (string) or element (object) of the target container in which you want the editor to appear. epiceditor textarea The ID (string) or element (object) of a textarea you would like to sync the editor's content with. On page load if there is content in the textarea, the editor will use that as its content. basePath The base path of the directory containing the /themes. epiceditor clientSideStorage Setting this to false will disable localStorage. true localStorageName The name to use for the localStorage object. epiceditor useNativeFullscreen Set to false to always use faux fullscreen (the same as what is used for unsupported browsers). true parser [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) is the only parser built into EpicEditor, but you can customize or toggle this by passing a parsing function to this option. For example: parser: MyCustomParser.parse marked focusOnLoad If true, editor will focus on load. false file.name If no file exists with this name a new one will be made, otherwise the existing will be opened. container ID file.defaultContent The content to show if no content exists for a file. NOTE: if the textarea option is used, the textarea's value will take precedence over defaultContent. file.autoSave How often to auto save the file in milliseconds. Set to false to turn it off. 100 theme.base The base styles such as the utility bar with the buttons. themes/base/epiceditor.css theme.editor The theme for the editor which is the area you type into. themes/editor/epic-dark.css theme.preview The theme for the previewer. themes/preview/github.css button If set to false will remove all buttons. All buttons set to true. button.preview If set to false will remove the preview button. true button.fullscreen If set to false will remove the fullscreen button. true button.bar If true or ""show"", any defined buttons will always be visible. If false or ""hide"", any defined buttons will never be visible. If ""auto"", buttons will usually be hidden, but shown if whenever the mouse is moved. ""auto"" shortcut.modifier The key to hold while holding the other shortcut keys to trigger a key combo. 18 (alt key) shortcut.fullscreen The shortcut to open fullscreen. 70 (f key) shortcut.preview The shortcut to toggle the previewer. 80 (p key) string.togglePreview The tooltip text that appears when hovering the preview icon. Toggle Preview Mode string.toggleEdit The tooltip text that appears when hovering the edit icon. Toggle Edit Mode string.toggleFullscreen The tooltip text that appears when hovering the fullscreen icon. Enter Fullscreen autogrow Whether to autogrow EpicEditor to fit its contents. If autogrow is desired one can either specify true, meaning to use default autogrow settings, or an object to define custom settings false autogrow.minHeight The minimum height (in pixels) that the editor should ever shrink to. This may also take a function that returns the desired minHeight if this is not a constant, or a falsey value if no minimum is desired 80 autogrow.maxHeight The maximum height (in pixels) that the editor should ever grow to. This may also take a function that returns the desired maxHeight if this is not a constant, or a falsey value if no maximum is desired false autogrow.scroll Whether the page should scroll to keep the caret in the same vertical place while autogrowing (recommended for mobile in particular) true load([callback]) Loads the editor by inserting it into the DOM by creating an iframe. Will trigger the load event, or you can provide a callback. editor.load(function () {   console.log(""Editor loaded."") }); unload([callback]) Unloads the editor by removing the iframe. Keeps any options and file contents so you can easily call .load() again. Will trigger the unload event, or you can provide a callback. editor.unload(function () {   console.log(""Editor unloaded."") }); getElement(element) Grabs an editor element for easy DOM manipulation. See the Themes section below for more on the layout of EpicEditor elements. container: The element given at setup in the options. wrapper: The wrapping <div> containing the 2 editor and previewer iframes. wrapperIframe: The iframe containing the wrapper element. editor: The #document of the editor iframe (i.e. you could do editor.getElement('editor').body). editorIframe: The iframe containing the editor element. previewer: The #document of the previewer iframe (i.e. you could do editor.getElement('previewer').body). previewerIframe: The iframe containing the previewer element. someBtn.onclick = function () {   console.log(editor.getElement('editor').body.innerHTML); // Returns the editor's content } is(state) Returns a boolean for the requested state. Useful when you need to know if the editor is loaded yet for example. Below is a list of supported states: loaded unloaded edit preview fullscreen fullscreenBtn.onclick = function () {   if (!editor.is('loaded')) { return; }   editor.enterFullscreen(); } open(filename) Opens a client side storage file into the editor. Note: This does not open files on your server or machine (yet). This simply looks in localStorage where EpicEditor stores drafts. openFileBtn.onclick = function () {   editor.open('some-file'); // Opens a file when the user clicks this button } importFile([filename],[content]) Imports a string of content into a client side storage file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. Useful if you want to inject a bunch of content via AJAX. Will also run .open() after import automatically. Note: This does not import files on your server or machine (yet). This simply looks in localStorage where EpicEditor stores drafts. importFileBtn.onclick = function () {   editor.importFile('some-file',""#Imported markdown\nFancy, huh?""); //Imports a file when the user clicks this button } exportFile([filename],[type]) Returns the plain text of the client side storage file, or if given a type, will return the content in the specified type. If you leave both parameters null it will return the current document's content in plain text. The supported export file types are: Note: This does not export files to your server or machine (yet). This simply looks in localStorage where EpicEditor stores drafts. text (default) html json (includes metadata) raw (warning: this is browser specific!) syncWithServerBtn.onclick = function () {   var theContent = editor.exportFile();   saveToServerAjaxCall('/save', {data:theContent}, function () {     console.log('Data was saved to the database.');   }); } rename(oldName, newName) Renames a client side storage file. Note: This does not rename files on your server or machine (yet). This simply looks in localStorage where EpicEditor stores drafts. renameFileBtn.onclick = function () {   var newName = prompt('What do you want to rename this file to?');   editor.rename('old-filename.md', newName); //Prompts a user and renames a file on button click } save() Manually saves a file to client side storage (localStorage by default). EpicEditor will save continuously every 100ms by default, but if you set autoSave in the options to false or to longer intervals it's useful to manually save. Note: This does not save files to your server or machine (yet). This simply looks in localStorage where EpicEditor stores drafts. saveFileBtn.onclick = function () {   editor.save(); } remove(name) Deletes a client side storage file. Note: This does not remove files from your server or machine (yet). This simply looks in localStorage where EpicEditor stores drafts. removeFileBtn.onclick = function () {   editor.remove('example.md'); } getFiles([name], [excludeContent]) If no name is given it returns an object containing the names and metadata of all client side storage file objects. If a name is specified it will return just the metadata of that single file object. If excludeContent is true, it will remove the content from the returned object. This is useful when you just want a list of files or get some meta data. If excludeContent is false (default), it'll return a content property per file in plain text format. Note: This does not get files from your server or machine (yet). This simply looks in localStorage where EpicEditor stores drafts. var files = editor.getFiles(); for (x in files) {   console.log('File: ' + x); //Returns the name of each file }; on(event, handler) Sets up an event handler (callback) for a specified event. For all event types, see the Events section below. editor.on('unload', function () {   console.log('Editor was removed'); }); emit(event) Fires an event programatically. Similar to jQuery's .trigger() editor.emit('unload'); // Triggers the handler provided in the ""on"" method above removeListener(event, [handler]) Allows you to remove all listeners for an event, or just the specified one. editor.removeListener('unload'); //The handler above would no longer fire preview() Puts the editor into preview mode. previewBtn.onclick = function () {   editor.preview(); } edit() Puts the editor into edit mode. editBtn.onclick = function () {   editor.edit(); } focus() Puts focus on the editor or previewer (whichever is visible). Works just like doing plain old JavaScript and input focus like someInput.focus(). The benefit of using this method however, is that it handles cross browser issues and also will focus on the visible view (edit or preview). showEditorBtn.onclick = function () {   editorWrapper.style.display = 'block'; // switch from being hidden from the user   editor.focus(); // Focus and allow user to start editing right away }  enterFullscreen([callback]) Puts the editor into fullscreen mode. A callback will be fired after the entering fullscreen animation completes. Some browsers will be nearly instant while others, mainly Chrome, take 750ms before this event is fired. If already in fullscreen, the callback will fire immediately. Note: due to browser security restrictions, calling enterFullscreen programmatically like this will not trigger native fullscreen. Native fullscreen can only be triggered by a user interaction like mousedown or keyup. enterFullscreenBtn.onclick = function () {   editor.enterFullscreen(function () {     console.log('Welcome to fullscreen mode!');   }); } exitFullscreen([callback]) Closes fullscreen mode. A callback will be fired after the exiting fullscreen animation completes. If already not in fullscreen, the callback will fire immediately. exitFullscreenBtn.onclick = function () {   editor.exitFullscreen(function () {     console.log('Finished closing fullscreen!');   }); } reflow([type], [callback]) reflow() allows you to ""reflow"" the editor in it's container. For example, let's say you increased the height of your wrapping element and want the editor to resize too. You could call reflow and the editor will resize to fit. You can pass it one of two strings as the first parameter to constrain the reflow to either width or height. It also provides you with a callback parameter if you'd like to do something after the resize is finished. The callback will return the new width and/or height in an object. Additionally, you can also listen for the reflow event. This will also give you back the new size. Note: If you call reflow() or reflow('width') and you have a fluid width container EpicEditor will no longer be fluid because doing a reflow on the width sets an inline style on the editor. // For an editor that takes up the whole browser window: window.onresize = function () {   editor.reflow(); }  // Constrain the reflow to just height: someDiv.resizeHeightHandle = function () {   editor.reflow('height'); }  // Same as the first example, but this has a callback window.onresize = function () {   editor.reflow(function (data) {     console.log('width: ', data.width, ' ', 'height: ', data.height);   }); } Events You can hook into specific events in EpicEditor with on() such as when a file is created, removed, or updated. Below is a complete list of currently supported events and their description. Event Name Description create Fires whenever a new file is created. read Fires whenever a file is read. update Fires whenever a file is updated. remove Fires whenever a file is deleted. load Fires when the editor loads via load(). unload Fires whenever the editor is unloaded via unload() preview Fires whenever the previewer is opened (excluding fullscreen) via preview() or the preview button. edit Fires whenever the editor is opened (excluding fullscreen) via edit() or the edit button. fullscreenenter Fires whenever the editor opens in fullscreen via fullscreen() or the fullscreen button. fullscreenexit Fires whenever the editor closes in fullscreen via fullscreen() or the fullscreen button. save Fires whenever save() is called manually, or implicitly by ```importFile``` or ```open```. autosave Fires whenever the autoSave interval fires, and the file contents have been updated since the last save. open Fires whenever a file is opened or loads automatically by EpicEditor or when open() is called. reflow Fires whenever reflow() is called. Will return the new dimensions in the callback. Will also fire every time there is a resize from autogrow. Themes Theming is easy in EpicEditor. There are three different <iframe>s which means styles wont leak between the ""chrome"" of EpicEditor, previewer, or editor. Each one is like it's own web page. In the themes directory you'll see base, preview, and editor. The base styles are for the ""chrome"" of the editor which contains elements such as the utility bar containing the icons. The editor is the styles for the contents of editor <iframe> and the preview styles are applied to the preview <iframe>. The HTML of a generated editor (excluding contents) looks like this: <div id=""container"">   <iframe id=""epiceditor-instance-id"">     <html>       <head>         <link type=""text/css"" id="""" rel=""stylesheet"" href=""epiceditor/themes/base/epiceditor.css"" media=""screen"">       </head>       <body>         <div id=""epiceditor-wrapper"">           <iframe id=""epiceditor-editor-frame"">             <html>               <head>                 <link type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"" href=""epiceditor/themes/editor/epic-dark.css"" media=""screen"">               </head>               <body contenteditable=""true"">                 <!-- raw content -->               </body>             </html>           </iframe>           <iframe id=""epiceditor-previewer-frame"">             <html>               <head>                 <link type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"" href=""epiceditor/themes/preview/github.css"" media=""screen"">               </head>               <body>                 <div id=""epiceditor-preview"" class=""epiceditor-preview"">                   <!-- rendered html -->                 </div>               </body>             </html>           </iframe>           <div id=""epiceditor-utilbar"">             <span title=""Toggle Preview Mode"" class=""epiceditor-toggle-btn epiceditor-toggle-preview-btn""></span>             <span title=""Enter Fullscreen"" class=""epiceditor-fullscreen-btn""></span>           </div>         </div>       </body>     </html>   </iframe> </div> Unlike the ""chrome"" of base or editor, the theming of the preview is done by CSS class so that you can reuse EpicEditor's theme to make your rendered page match your previewed. First, include your chosen theme on every page: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""/epiceditor/themes/preview/github.css""> (you may need to adjust the path) Mark your rendered content with .epiceditor-preview: <div id=""my-content"" class=""epiceditor-preview""> ... </div> Custom Parsers EpicEditor is set up to allow you to use any parser that accepts and returns a string. This means you can use any flavor of Markdown, process Textile, or even create a simple HTML editor/previewer (parser: false). The possibilities are endless. Just make the parser available and pass its parsing function to the EpicEditor setting and you should be all set. You can output plain text or HTML. Here's an example of a parser that could remove ""bad words"" from the preview: var editor = new EpicEditor({   parser: function (str) {     var blacklist = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];     return str.split(' ').map(function (word) {       // If the word exists, replace with asterisks       if (blacklist.indexOf(word) > -1) {         return '****'       }       return word;     }).join(' ');   } }).load(); Here's a Wiki to HTML parser by Remy Sharp used with EpicEditor: var editor = new EpicEditor({   parser: function (str) {     return str.wiki2html();   } }).load(); For even more customization and optimization you can replace the default built-in processor on build. Running jake build parser=path/to/parser.js will override the default Marked build and replace it with your custom script.

To build jsoneditor: Install dependencies: npm install  Build JSON Editor: npm run build  This will generate the files ./jsoneditor.js, ./jsoneditor.css, and minified versions in the dist of the project. To automatically build when a source file has changed: npm run watch  This will update ./jsoneditor.js and ./jsoneditor.css in the dist folder on every change, but it will NOT update the minified versions as that's an expensive operation. Custom builds The source code of JSONEditor consists of CommonJS modules. JSONEditor can be bundled in a customized way using a module bundler like browserify or webpack. First, install all dependencies of jsoneditor: npm install  To create a custom bundle of the source code using browserify: browserify ./index.js -o ./jsoneditor.custom.js -s JSONEditor  The Ace editor, used in mode code, accounts for about 75% of the total size of the library. To exclude the Ace editor from the bundle: browserify ./index.js -o ./jsoneditor.custom.js -s JSONEditor -x brace -x brace/mode/json -x brace/ext/searchbox  To minify the generated bundle, use uglifyjs: uglifyjs ./jsoneditor.custom.js -o ./jsoneditor.custom.min.js -m -c  Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Mar 13, 2016 package.json Release v1.6.0 Jun 28, 2016 README.md Squire Squire is an HTML5 rich text editor, which provides powerful cross-browser normalisation, whilst being supremely lightweight and flexible. It is built for the present and the future, and as such does not support truly ancient browsers. It should work fine back to around Opera 12, Firefox 3.5, Safari 5, Chrome 9 and IE9. An example UI integration can be tried at http://neilj.github.io/Squire/. Unlike other HTML5 rich text editors, Squire was written as a component for writing documents (emails, essays, etc.), not doing wysiwyg websites. If you are looking for support for inserting form controls or flash components or the like, you'll need to look elsewhere. However for many purposes, Squire may be just what you need, providing the power without the bloat. The key features are: Lightweight Only 11.5KB of JS after minification and gzip (35KB before gzip). Does not include its own XHR wrapper, widget library or lightbox overlays. No dependencies. No UI for a toolbar is supplied, allowing you to integrate seamlessly with the rest of your application and lose the bloat of having two UI toolkits loaded. Instead, you get a component you can insert in place of a <textarea> and manipulate programatically. Powerful Squire provides an engine that handles the heavy work for you, making it easy to add extra features. With the changeFormat method you can easily add or remove any inline formatting you wish. And the modifyBlocks method can be used to make complicated block-level changes in a relatively easy manner. If you need more commands than in the simple API, I suggest you check out the source code (it's not very long), and see how a lot of the other API methods are implemented in terms of these two methods. The general philosophy of Squire is to allow the browser to do as much as it can (which unfortunately is not very much), but take control anywhere it deviates from what is required, or there are significant cross-browser differences. As such, the document.execCommand method is not used at all; instead all formatting is done via custom functions, and certain keys, such as 'enter' and 'backspace' are handled by the editor. Installation and usage Copy the contents of the build/ directory onto your server. Edit the <style> block in document.html to add the default styles you would like the editor to use (or link to an external stylesheet). In your application, instead of a <textarea>, use an <iframe src=""path/to/document.html"">. In your JS, attach an event listener to the load event of the iframe. When this fires you can grab a reference to the editor object through iframe.contentWindow.editor. Use the API below with the editor object to set and get data and integrate with your application or framework. Advanced usage If you load the library into a top-level document (rather than an iframe), or load it in an iframe without the data-squireinit=""true"" attribute on its <html> element, it will not turn the page into an editable document, but will instead add a constructor named Squire to the global scope. You can also require the NPM package squire-rte to import Squire in a modular program without adding names to the global namespace. Call new Squire( document ), with the document from an iframe to instantiate multiple rich text areas on the same page efficiently. Note, for compatibility with all browsers (particularly Firefox), you MUST wait for the iframe's onload event to fire before instantiating Squire. Setting the default block style By default, the editor will use a <div> for blank lines, as most users have been conditioned by Microsoft Word to expect Enter to act like pressing return on a typewriter. If you would like to use <p> tags (or anything else) for the default block type instead, you can pass a config object as the second parameter to the squire constructor. You can also pass a set of attributes to apply to each default block: var editor = new Squire( document, {     blockTag: 'P',     blockAttributes: { style: 'font-size: 16px;' } })  If using the simple setup, call editor.setConfig(…); with your config object instead. Be sure to do this before calling editor.setHTML(). Determining button state If you are adding a UI to Squire, you'll probably want to show a button in different states depending on whether a particular style is active in the current selection or not. For example, a ""Bold"" button would be in a depressed state if the text under the cursor is already bold. The efficient way to determine the state for most buttons is to monitor the ""pathChange"" event in the editor, and determine the state from the new path. If the selection goes across nodes, you will need to call the hasFormat method for each of your buttons to determine whether the styles are active. See the getPath and hasFormat documentation for more information. License Squire is released under the MIT license. See LICENSE for full license. API addEventListener Attach an event listener to the editor. The handler can be either a function or an object with a handleEvent method. This function or method will be called whenever the event fires, with an event object as the sole argument. The following events may be observed: focus: The editor gained focus. blur: The editor lost focus keydown: Standard DOM keydown event. keypress: Standard DOM keypress event. keyup: Standard DOM keyup event. input: The user inserted, deleted or changed the style of some text; in other words, the result for editor.getHTML() will have changed. pathChange: The path (see getPath documentation) to the cursor has changed. The new path is available as the path property on the event object. select: The user selected some text. undoStateChange: The availability of undo and/or redo has changed. The event object has two boolean properties, canUndo and canRedo to let you know the new state. willPaste: The user is pasting content into the document. The content that will be inserted is available as the fragment property on the event object. You can modify this fragment in your event handler to change what will be pasted. You can also call the preventDefault on the event object to cancel the paste operation. The method takes two arguments: type: The event to listen for. e.g. 'focus'. handler: The callback function to invoke Returns self (the Squire instance). removeEventListener Remove an event listener attached via the addEventListener method. The method takes two arguments: type: The event type the handler was registered for. handler: The handler to remove. Returns self (the Squire instance). setKeyHandler Adds or removes a keyboard shortcut. You can use this to override the default keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl-B for bold – see the bottom of KeyHandlers.js for the list). This method takes two arguments: key: The key to handle, including any modifiers in alphabetical order. e.g. ""alt-ctrl-meta-shift-enter"" fn: The function to be called when this key is pressed, or null if removing a key handler. The function will be passed three arguments when called: self: A reference to the Squire instance. event: The key event object. range: A Range object representing the current selection. Returns self (the Squire instance). focus Focuses the editor. The method takes no arguments. Returns self (the Squire instance). blur Removes focus from the editor. The method takes no arguments. Returns self (the Squire instance). getDocument Returns the document object of the editable area. May be useful to do transformations outside the realm of the API. getHTML Returns the HTML value of the editor in its current state. This value is equivalent to the contents of the <body> tag and does not include any surrounding boilerplate. setHTML Sets the HTML value for the editor. The value supplied should not contain <body> tags or anything outside of that. The method takes one argument: html: The html to set. Returns self (the Squire instance). getSelectedText Returns the text currently selected in the editor. insertImage Inserts an image at the current cursor location. The method takes one argument: src: The source path for the image. Returns a reference to the newly inserted image element. insertHTML Inserts an HTML fragment at the current cursor location, or replaces the selection if selected. The value supplied should not contain <body> tags or anything outside of that. The method takes one argument: html: The html to insert. Returns self (the Squire instance). getPath Returns the path through the DOM tree from the <body> element to the current current cursor position. This is a string consisting of the tag, id, class, font, and color names in CSS format. For example BODY>BLOCKQUOTE>DIV#id>STRONG>SPAN.font[fontFamily=Arial,sans-serif]>EM. If a selection has been made, so different parts of the selection may have different paths, the value will be (selection). The path is useful for efficiently determining the current formatting for bold, italic, underline etc, and thus determining button state. If a selection has been made, you can has the hasFormat method instead to get the current state for the properties you care about. getFontInfo Returns an object containing the active font family, size, colour and background colour for the the current cursor position, if any are set. The property names are respectively family, size, color and backgroundColor. It looks at style attributes to detect this, so will not detect <FONT> tags or non-inline styles. If a selection across multiple elements has been made, it will return an empty object. getCursorPosition Returns a bounding client rect (top/left/right/bottom properties relative to the viewport) for the current selection/cursor. getSelection Returns a W3C Range object representing the current selection/cursor position. setSelection Changes the current selection/cursor position. The method takes one argument: range: The W3C Range object representing the desired selection. Returns self (the Squire instance). moveCursorToStart Removes any current selection and moves the cursor to the very beginning of the document. Returns self (the Squire instance). moveCursorToEnd Removes any current selection and moves the cursor to the very end of the document. Returns self (the Squire instance). saveUndoState Saves an undo checkpoint with the current editor state. Methods that modify the state (e.g. bold/setHighlightColour/modifyBlocks) will automatically save undo checkpoints; you only need this method if you want to modify the DOM outside of one of these methods, and you want to save an undo checkpoint first. Returns self (the Squire instance). undo Undoes the most recent change. Returns self (the Squire instance). redo If the user has just undone a change, this will reapply that change. Returns self (the Squire instance). hasFormat Queries the editor for whether a particular format is applied anywhere in the current selection. The method takes two arguments: tag: The tag of the format attributes: (optional) Any attributes the format. Returns true if any of the selection is contained within an element with the specified tag and attributes, otherwise returns false. bold Makes any non-bold currently selected text bold (by wrapping it in a <b> tag). Returns self (the Squire instance). italic Makes any non-italic currently selected text italic (by wrapping it in an <i> tag). Returns self (the Squire instance). underline Makes any non-underlined currently selected text underlined (by wrapping it in a <u> tag). Returns self (the Squire instance). removeBold Removes any bold formatting from the selected text. Returns self (the Squire instance). removeItalic Removes any italic formatting from the selected text. Returns self (the Squire instance). removeUnderline Removes any underline formatting from the selected text. Returns self (the Squire instance). makeLink Makes the currently selected text a link. If no text is selected, the URL or email will be inserted as text at the current cursor point and made into a link. This method takes two arguments: url: The url or email to link to. attributes: (optional) An object containing other attributes to set on the <a> node. e.g. { target: '_blank' }. Any href attribute will be overwritten by the url given as the first argument. Returns self (the Squire instance). removeLink Removes any link that is currently at least partially selected. Returns self (the Squire instance). setFontFace Sets the font face for the selected text. This method takes one argument: font: A comma-separated list of fonts (in order of preference) to set. Returns self (the Squire instance). setFontSize Sets the font size for the selected text. This method takes one argument: size: A size to set. Any CSS length value or absolute-size value is accepted, e.g. '13px', or 'small'. Returns self (the Squire instance). setTextColour Sets the colour of the selected text. This method takes one argument: colour: The colour to set. Any CSS colour value is accepted, e.g. '#f00', or 'hsl(0,0,0)'. Returns self (the Squire instance). setHighlightColour Sets the colour of the background of the selected text. This method takes one argument: colour: The colour to set. Any CSS colour value is accepted, e.g. '#f00', or 'hsl(0,0,0)'. Returns self (the Squire instance). setTextAlignment Sets the text alignment in all blocks at least partially contained by the selection. This method takes one argument: alignment: The direction to align to. Can be 'left', 'right', 'center' or 'justify'. Returns self (the Squire instance). setTextDirection Sets the text direction in all blocks at least partially contained by the selection. This method takes one argument: direction: The text direction. Can be 'ltr' or 'rtl'. Returns self (the Squire instance). forEachBlock Executes a function on each block in the current selection, or until the function returns a truthy value. This method takes two arguments: fn The function to execute on each block node at least partially contained in the current selection. The function will be called with the block node as the only argument. mutates A boolean indicating whether your function may modify anything in the document in any way. Returns self (the Squire instance). modifyBlocks Extracts a portion of the DOM tree (up to the block boundaries of the current selection), modifies it and then reinserts it and merges the edges. See the code for examples if you're interested in using this function. This method takes one argument: modify The function to apply to the extracted DOM tree; gets a document fragment as a sole argument. this is bound to the Squire instance. Should return the node or fragment to be reinserted in the DOM. Returns self (the Squire instance). increaseQuoteLevel Increases by 1 the quote level (number of <blockquote> tags wrapping) all blocks at least partially selected. Returns self (the Squire instance). decreaseQuoteLevel Decreases by 1 the quote level (number of <blockquote> tags wrapping) all blocks at least partially selected. Returns self (the Squire instance). makeUnorderedList Changes all at-least-partially selected blocks to be part of an unordered list. Returns self (the Squire instance). makeOrderedList Changes all at-least-partially selected blocks to be part of an ordered list. Returns self (the Squire instance). removeList Changes any at-least-partially selected blocks which are part of a list to no longer be part of a list. Returns self (the Squire instance). increaseListLevel Increases by 1 the nesting level of any at-least-partially selected blocks which are part of a list. Returns self (the Squire instance). decreaseListLevel Decreases by 1 the nesting level of any at-least-partially selected blocks which are part of a list. Returns self (the Squire instance). removeAllFormatting Removes all formatting from the selection. Block elements (list items, table cells, etc.) are kept as separate blocks. Returns self (the Squire instance). changeFormat Change the inline formatting of the current selection. This is a high-level method which is used to implement the bold, italic etc. helper methods. THIS METHOD IS ONLY FOR USE WITH INLINE TAGS, NOT BLOCK TAGS. It takes 4 arguments: An object describing the formatting to add, or null if you only wish to remove formatting. If supplied, this object should have a tag property with the string name of the tag to wrap around the selected text (e.g. ""STRONG"") and optionally an attributes property, consisting of an object of attributes to apply to the tag (e.g. {""class"": ""bold""}). An object describing the formatting to remove, in the same format as the object given to add formatting, or null if you only wish to add formatting. A Range object with the range to apply the formatting changes to (or null/omit to apply to current selection). A boolean (defaults to false if omitted). If true, any formatting nodes that cover at least part of the selected range will be removed entirely (so will potentially be removed from text outside the selected range as well). If false, the formatting nodes will continue to apply to any text outside the selection. This is useful, for example, when removing links. If any of the text in the selection is part of a link, the whole link is removed, rather than the link continuing to apply to bits of text outside the selection. modifyDocument Takes in a function that can modify the document without the modifications being treated as input. This is useful when the document needs to be changed programmatically, but those changes should not raise input events or modify the undo state.

Trix is a WYSIWYG editor for writing messages, comments, articles, and lists—the simple documents most web apps are made of. It features a sophisticated document model, support for embedded attachments, and outputs terse and consistent HTML. Trix is an open-source project from Basecamp, the creators of Ruby on Rails. Millions of people trust their text to Basecamp, and we built Trix to give them the best possible editing experience. See Trix in action in the all-new Basecamp 3. Different By Design Most WYSIWYG editors are wrappers around HTML’s contenteditable and execCommand APIs, designed by Microsoft to support live editing of web pages in Internet Explorer 5.5, and eventually reverse-engineered and copied by other browsers. Because these APIs were never fully specified or documented, and because WYSIWYG HTML editors are enormous in scope, each browser’s implementation has its own set of bugs and quirks, and JavaScript developers are left to resolve the inconsistencies. Trix sidesteps these inconsistencies by treating contenteditable as an I/O device: when input makes its way to the editor, Trix converts that input into an editing operation on its internal document model, then re-renders that document back into the editor. This gives Trix complete control over what happens after every keystroke, and avoids the need to use execCommand at all. Built for the Modern Web Trix supports all evergreen, self-updating desktop and mobile browsers. Trix is built with emerging web standards, notably Custom Elements, Mutation Observer, and Promises. Eventually we expect all browsers to implement these standards. In the meantime, Trix includes polyfills for missing functionality. Getting Started Include the bundled trix.css and trix.js files in the <head> of your page. <head>   …   <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""trix.css"">   <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""trix.js""></script> </head> trix.css includes default styles for the Trix toolbar, editor, and attachments. Skip this file if you prefer to define these styles yourself. To use your own polyfills, or to target only browsers that support all of the required standards, include trix-core.js instead. Creating an Editor Place an empty <trix-editor></trix-editor> tag on the page. Trix will automatically insert a separate <trix-toolbar> before the editor. Like an HTML <textarea>, <trix-editor> accepts autofocus and placeholder attributes. Unlike a <textarea>, <trix-editor> automatically expands vertically to fit its contents. Integrating With Forms To submit the contents of a <trix-editor> with a form, first define a hidden input field in the form and assign it an id. Then reference that id in the editor’s input attribute. <form …>   <input id=""x"" type=""hidden"" name=""content"">   <trix-editor input=""x""></trix-editor> </form> Trix will automatically update the value of the hidden input field with each change to the editor. Populating With Stored Content To populate a <trix-editor> with stored content, include that content in the associated input element’s value attribute. <form …>   <input id=""x"" value=""Editor content goes here"" type=""hidden"" name=""content"">   <trix-editor input=""x""></trix-editor> </form> Always use an associated input element to safely populate an editor. Trix won’t load any HTML content inside a <trix-editor>…</trix-editor> tag. Styling Formatted Content To ensure what you see when you edit is what you see when you save, use a CSS class name to scope styles for Trix formatted content. Apply this class name to your <trix-editor> element, and to a containing element when you render stored Trix content for display in your application. <trix-editor class=""trix-content""></trix-editor> <div class=""trix-content"">Stored content here</div> The default trix.css file includes styles for basic formatted content—including bulleted and numbered lists, code blocks, and block quotes—under the class name trix-content. We encourage you to use these styles as a starting point by copying them into your application’s CSS with a different class name. Storing Attached Files Trix automatically accepts files dragged or pasted into an editor and inserts them as attachments in the document. Each attachment is considered pending until you store it remotely and provide Trix with a permanent URL. To store attachments, listen for the trix-attachment-add event. Upload the attached files with XMLHttpRequest yourself and set the attachment’s URL attribute upon completion. See the attachment example for detailed information. If you don’t want to accept dropped or pasted files, call preventDefault() on the trix-file-accept event, which Trix dispatches just before the trix-attachment-add event. Editing Text Programmatically You can manipulate a Trix editor programmatically through the Trix.Editor interface, available on each <trix-editor> element through its editor property. var element = document.querySelector(""trix-editor"") element.editor  // is a Trix.Editor instance Understanding the Document Model The formatted content of a Trix editor is known as a document, and is represented as an instance of the Trix.Document class. To get the editor’s current document, use the editor.getDocument method. element.editor.getDocument()  // is a Trix.Document instance You can convert a document to an unformatted JavaScript string with the document.toString method. var document = element.editor.getDocument() document.toString()  // is a JavaScript string Immutability and Equality Documents are immutable values. Each change you make in an editor replaces the previous document with a new document. Capturing a snapshot of the editor’s content is as simple as keeping a reference to its document, since that document will never change over time. (This is how Trix implements undo.) To compare two documents for equality, use the document.isEqualTo method. var document = element.editor.getDocument() document.isEqualTo(element.editor.getDocument())  // true Getting and Setting the Selection Trix documents are structured as sequences of individually addressable characters. The index of one character in a document is called a position, and a start and end position together make up a range. To get the editor’s current selection, use the editor.getSelectedRange method, which returns a two-element array containing the start and end positions. element.editor.getSelectedRange()  // [0, 0] You can set the editor’s current selection by passing a range array to the editor.setSelectedRange method. // Select the first character in the document element.editor.setSelectedRange([0, 1]) Collapsed Selections When the start and end positions of a range are equal, the range is said to be collapsed. In the editor, a collapsed selection appears as a blinking cursor rather than a highlighted span of text. For convenience, the following calls to setSelectedRange are equivalent when working with collapsed selections: element.editor.setSelectedRange(1) element.editor.setSelectedRange([1]) element.editor.setSelectedRange([1, 1]) Directional Movement To programmatically move the cursor or selection through the document, call the editor.moveCursorInDirection or editor.expandSelectionInDirection methods with a direction argument. The direction can be either ""forward"" or ""backward"". // Move the cursor backward one character element.editor.moveCursorInDirection(""backward"")  // Expand the end of the selection forward by one character element.editor.expandSelectionInDirection(""forward"") Converting Positions to Pixel Offsets Sometimes you need to know the x and y coordinates of a character at a given position in the editor. For example, you might want to absolutely position a pop-up menu element below the editor’s cursor. Call the editor.getClientRectAtPosition method with a position argument to get a DOMRect instance representing the left and top offsets, width, and height of the character at the given position. var rect = element.editor.getClientRectAtPosition(0) [rect.left, rect.top]  // [17, 49] Inserting and Deleting Text The editor interface provides methods for inserting, replacing, and deleting text at the current selection. To insert or replace text, begin by setting the selected range, then call one of the insertion methods below. Trix will first remove any selected text, then insert the new text at the start position of the selected range. Inserting Plain Text To insert unformatted text into the document, call the editor.insertString method. // Insert “Hello” at the beginning of the document element.editor.setSelectedRange([0, 0]) element.editor.insertString(""Hello"") Inserting HTML To insert HTML into the document, call the editor.insertHTML method. Trix will first convert the HTML into its internal document model. During this conversion, any formatting that cannot be represented in a Trix document will be lost. // Insert a bold “Hello” at the beginning of the document element.editor.setSelectedRange([0, 0]) element.editor.insertHTML(""<strong>Hello</strong>"") Inserting a File To insert a DOM File object into the document, call the editor.insertFile method. Trix will insert a pending attachment for the file as if you had dragged and dropped it onto the editor. // Insert the selected file from the first file input element var file = document.querySelector(""input[type=file]"").file element.editor.insertFile(file) Inserting a Line Break To insert a line break, call the editor.insertLineBreak method, which is functionally equivalent to pressing the return key. // Insert “Hello\n” element.editor.insertString(""Hello"") element.editor.insertLineBreak() Deleting Text If the current selection is collapsed, you can simulate deleting text before or after the cursor with the editor.deleteInDirection method. // “Backspace” the first character in the document element.editor.setSelectedRange([1, 1]) element.editor.deleteInDirection(""backward"")  // Delete the second character in the document element.editor.setSelectedRange([1, 1]) element.editor.deleteInDirection(""forward"") To delete a range of text, first set the selected range, then call editor.deleteInDirection with either direction as the argument. // Delete the first five characters element.editor.setSelectedRange([0, 4]) element.editor.deleteInDirection(""forward"") Working With Attributes and Indentation Trix represents formatting as sets of attributes applied across ranges of a document. By default, Trix supports the inline attributes bold, italic, href, and strike, and the block-level attributes quote, code, bullet, and number. Applying Formatting To apply formatting to the current selection, use the editor.activateAttribute method. element.editor.insertString(""Hello"") element.editor.setSelectedRange([0, 5]) element.editor.activateAttribute(""bold"") To set the href attribute, pass a URL as the second argument to editor.activateAttribute. element.editor.insertString(""Trix"") element.editor.setSelectedRange([0, 4]) element.editor.activateAttribute(""href"", ""https://trix-editor.org/"") Removing Formatting Use the editor.deactivateAttribute method to remove formatting from a selection. element.editor.setSelectedRange([2, 4]) element.editor.deactivateAttribute(""bold"") Formatting With a Collapsed Selection If you activate or deactivate attributes when the selection is collapsed, your formatting changes will apply to the text inserted by any subsequent calls to editor.insertString. element.editor.activateAttribute(""italic"") element.editor.insertString(""This is italic"") Adjusting the Indentation Level To adjust the indentation level of block-level attributes, call the editor.increaseIndentationLevel and editor.decreaseIndentationLevel methods. element.editor.activateAttribute(""quote"") element.editor.increaseIndentationLevel() element.editor.decreaseIndentationLevel() Using Undo and Redo Trix editors support unlimited undo and redo. Successive typing and formatting changes are consolidated together at five-second intervals; all other input changes are recorded individually in undo history. Call the editor.undo and editor.redo methods to perform an undo or redo operation. element.editor.undo() element.editor.redo() Changes you make through the editor interface will not automatically record undo entries. You can save your own undo entries by calling the editor.recordUndoEntry method with a description argument. element.editor.insertString(""Hello"") element.editor.recordUndoEntry(""Insert Text"") Loading and Saving Editor State Serialize an editor’s state with JSON.stringify and restore saved state with the editor.loadJSON method. The serialized state includes the document and current selection, but does not include undo history. // Save editor state to local storage localStorage[""editorState""] = JSON.stringify(element.editor)  // Restore editor state from local storage element.editor.loadJSON(JSON.parse(localStorage[""editorState""])) Observing Editor Changes The <trix-editor> element emits several events which you can use to observe and respond to changes in editor state. trix-initialize fires when the <trix-editor> element is attached to the DOM and its editor object is ready for use. trix-change fires whenever the editor’s contents have changed. trix-selection-change fires any time the selected range changes in the editor. trix-focus and trix-blur fire when the editor gains or loses focus, respectively. trix-file-accept fires when a file is dropped or inserted into the editor. You can access the DOM File object through the file property on the event. Call preventDefault on the event to prevent attaching the file to the document. trix-attachment-add fires after an attachment is added to the document. You can access the Trix attachment object through the attachment property on the event. If the attachment object has a file property, you should store this file remotely and set the attachment’s URL attribute. See the attachment example for detailed information. trix-attachment-remove fires when an attachment is removed from the document. You can access the Trix attachment object through the attachment property on the event. You may wish to use this event to clean up remotely stored files.

We welcome contributions in the form of bug reports, pull requests, or thoughtful discussions in the GitHub issue tracker. Please see the Code of Conduct for our pledge to contributors. Trix was created by Javan Makhmali and Sam Stephenson, with development sponsored by Basecamp. Building From Source Trix is written in CoffeeScript and compiled to JavaScript with Blade. From inside a checkout of the Trix Git repository, issue the following commands to build the distributable files in dist/: $ bin/setup $ bin/blade build  Developing In-Browser You can spawn a development web server to work on Trix in a more convenient fashion. Instead of manually rebuilding the source each time, just reload a page in your browser to see your changes. To develop in-browser, run bin/setup and follow the displayed instructions. Running Tests Make sure you’re set up to build from source using the instructions above. Then run bin/blade runner and visit the displayed URL to run the Trix test suite. Pull Requests Only commit changes to Trix’s source (everything except the compiled files in /dist) and leave the VERSION unchanged. We update both when publishing new releases. ❤️ © 2016 Basecamp, LLC. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Examples http://jhollingworth.github.com/bootstrap-wysihtml5 Quick Start If you are using rails use the bootstrap-wysihtml5-rails gem. gem install bootstrap-wysihtml5-rails  Otherwise, download the latest version of bootstrap-wysihtml5. Files to reference <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/css/bootstrap-wysihtml5.css""></link> <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/css/bootstrap.min.css""></link> <script src=""js/wysihtml5-0.3.0.js""></script> <script src=""js/jquery-1.7.2.min.js""></script> <script src=""js/bootstrap.min.js""></script> <script src=""js/bootstrap-wysihtml5.js""></script>  Usage <textarea id=""some-textarea"" placeholder=""Enter text ...""></textarea> <script type=""text/javascript""> 	$('#some-textarea').wysihtml5(); </script>  You can get the html generated by getting the value of the text area, e.g. $('#some-textarea').val();  Advanced Options An options object can be passed in to .wysihtml5() to configure the editor: $('#some-textarea').wysihtml5({someOption: 23, ...})  Buttons To override which buttons to show, set the appropriate flags: $('#some-textarea').wysihtml5({ 	""font-styles"": true, //Font styling, e.g. h1, h2, etc. Default true 	""emphasis"": true, //Italics, bold, etc. Default true 	""lists"": true, //(Un)ordered lists, e.g. Bullets, Numbers. Default true 	""html"": false, //Button which allows you to edit the generated HTML. Default false 	""link"": true, //Button to insert a link. Default true 	""image"": true, //Button to insert an image. Default true, 	""color"": false //Button to change color of font   });  Custom Templates for Toolbar Buttons To define custom templates for buttons, you can submit a customTemplates hash with the new definitions. Each entry should be a function which expects ‘locale’ and optional ‘options’ to manage the translations. For example, the default template used for the editHtml mode button looks like this (with size fetched from the optional ‘options’) <li>   <div class='btn-group'>     <a class='btn"" + size + ""' data-wysihtml5-action='change_view' title='"" + locale.html.edit + ""'><i class='icon-pencil'></i></a>""   </div> </li>  You can change it to not use the pencil icon (for example) by defining the custom template like this: var myCustomTemplates = {   html : function(locale) {     return ""<li>"" +            ""<div class='btn-group'>"" +            ""<a class='btn' data-wysihtml5-action='change_view' title='"" + locale.html.edit + ""'>HTML</a>"" +            ""</div>"" +            ""</li>"";   } }  // pass in your custom templates on init $('#some-textarea').wysihtml5({    customTemplates: myCustomTemplates });  This will override only the toolbar template for html, and all others will use the default. Stylesheets It is possible to supply a number of stylesheets for inclusion in the editor ``:</p> <pre> $('#some-textarea').wysihtml5({ ""stylesheets"": [""/path/to/editor.css""] }); </pre> <h3>Events</h3> <p>Wysihtml5 exposes a <a href=""https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5/wiki/Events"">number of events</a>. You can hook into these events when initialising the editor:</p> <pre> $('#some-textarea').wysihtml5({ ""events"": { ""load"": function() { console.log(""Loaded!""); }, ""blur"": function() { console.log(""Blured""); } } }); </pre> <h3>Shallow copy by default, deep on request</h3> <p>Options you pass in will be added to the defaults via a shallow copy. (see <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/"" title="""">jQuery.extend</a> for details). You can use a deep copy instead (which is probably what you want if you&#8217;re adding tags or classes to parserRules) via &#8216;deepExtend&#8217;, as in the parserRules example below.</p> <h3>Parser Rules</h3> <p>If you find the editor is stripping out tags or attributes you need, then you&#8217;ll want to extend (or replace) parserRules. This example extends the defaults to allow the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags, and the class &#8220;middle&#8221;:</p> <pre> $('#some-textarea').wysihtml5('deepExtend', { parserRules: { classes: { ""middle"": 1 }, tags: { strong: {}, em: {} } } }); </pre> <p>There&#8217;s quite a bit that can be done with parserRules; see <a href=""https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5/blob/master/parser_rules/advanced.js"">wysihtml5&#8217;s advanced parser ruleset</a> for details. bootstrap-wysihtml5&#8217;s default parserRules can be found <a href=""https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5/blob/master/src/bootstrap-wysihtml5.js"">in the source</a> (just search for &#8216;parserRules&#8217; in the file).</p> <h3>Defaults</h3> <p>You can change bootstrap-wysihtml5&#8217;s defaults by altering:</p> <pre> $.fn.wysihtml5.defaultOptions </pre> <p>This object has the same structure as the options object you pass in to .wysihtml5(). You can revert to the original defaults by calling:</p> <pre> $(this).wysihtml5('resetDefaults') </pre> <p>Operations on the defaults are not thread-safe; if you&#8217;re going to change the defaults, you probably want to do it only once, after you load the bootstrap-wysihtml plugin and before you start instantiating your editors.</p> <h2>The underlying wysihtml5 object</h2> <p>You can access the <a href=""https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5"">wysihtml5 editor object</a> like this:</p> <pre> var wysihtml5Editor = $('#some-textarea').data(""wysihtml5"").editor; wysihtml5Editor.composer.commands.exec(""bold""); </pre> <h2>I18n</h2> <p>You can use Bootstrap-wysihtml5 in other languages. There are some translations available in the src/locales directory. You can include your desired one after the plugin and pass its key to the editor. Example:</p> <pre> &lt;script src=""src/locales/bootstrap-wysihtml5.pt-BR.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt; $('#some-textarea').wysihtml5({locale: ""pt-BR""}); &lt;/script&gt; </pre> <p>It is possible to use custom translations as well. Just add a new key to $.fn.wysihtml5.locale before calling the editor constructor.</p> Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

It uses a sophisticated security concept and aims to generate fully valid HTML5 markup by preventing unmaintainable tag soups and inline styles. The code is completely library agnostic: No jQuery, Prototype or similar is required. This project was initiated and is supported by the XING AG. Thanks! Features Auto linking of urls as-you-type Generates valid and semantic HTML5 markup (no <font>) Uses class-names instead of inline styles Unifies line-break handling across browsers (hitting enter will create <br> instead of <p> or <div>) Auto-parses content inserted via copy & paste (from Word, Powerpoint, PDF, other web pages, …) Converts invalid or unknown html tags into valid/similar tags Source code view for users with HTML skills Uses sandboxed iframes in order to prevent identity theft through XSS Editor inherits styles and attributes (placeholder, autofocus, …) from original textarea (you only have to style one element) Speech-input for Chrome Browser Support The rich text editing interface is supported in IE8+, FF 3.5+, Safari 4+, Safari on iOS 5+, Opera 11+ and Chrome. Graceful Degradation: Users with other browsers will see the textarea and are still able to write plain HTML by themselves.

It is reliable and correct according to RFC 4180, and it comes with these features: Easy to use Parse CSV files directly (local or over the network) Fast mode (is really fast) Stream large files (even via HTTP) Reverse parsing (converts JSON to CSV) Auto-detect delimiter Worker threads to keep your web page reactive Header row support Pause, resume, abort Can convert numbers and booleans to their types Optional jQuery integration to get files from <input type=""file""> elements Papa Parse has no dependencies - not even jQuery. Homepage & Demo Homepage Demo To learn how to use Papa Parse: Documentation Papa Parse for Node Rich Harris forked this project to make Baby Parse which runs in Node.js environments. $ npm install babyparse Baby Parse on npm registry Use it just like Papa Parse. However: Files are not supported; strings only (you can use Node's file facilities to load file contents yourself) Some config options are unavailable: worker download (you can use Node's network facilities to download files yourself) encoding chunk Otherwise, Baby Parse has nearly all the same functionality as Papa Parse 4.0, including the unparse() utility. Get Started Use papaparse.min.js for production. For usage instructions, see the homepage and, for more detail, the documentation. Tests Papa Parse is under test. Download this repository, run npm install, then npm test to run the tests in your browser. Contributing To discuss a new feature or ask a question, open an issue. To fix a bug, submit a pull request to be credited with the contributors! Remember, a pull request, with test, is best. You may also discuss on Twitter with #PapaParse or directly to me, @mholt6.

Apr 29, 2014 README.md jBinary Binary data in JavaScript is easy! jBinary makes it easy to create, load, parse, modify and save complex binary files and data structures in both browser and Node.js. It works on top of jDataView (DataView polyfill with convenient extensions). Was inspired by jParser and derived as new library with full set of operations for binary data. How can I use it? Typical scenario: Describe typeset with JavaScript-compatible declarative syntax (jBinary will do type caching for you). Create jBinary instance from memory or from data source and your typeset. Read/write data just as native JavaScript objects! API Documentation. Check out wiki for detailed API documentation. Is there any example code? How about TAR archive modification: // configuring paths for Require.js // (you can use CommonJS (Component, Node.js) or simple script tags as well) require.config({   paths: {     jdataview: '//jdataview.github.io/dist/jdataview',     jbinary: '//jdataview.github.io/dist/jbinary',     TAR: '//jdataview.github.io/jBinary.Repo/typeSets/tar' // TAR archive typeset   } });  require(['jbinary', 'TAR'], function (jBinary, TAR) {   // loading TAR archive with given typeset   jBinary.load('sample.tar', TAR).then(function (jb/* : jBinary */) {     // read everything using type aliased in TAR['jBinary.all']     var files = jb.readAll();      // do something with files in TAR archive (like rename them to upper case)     files.forEach(function (file) {       file.name = file.name.toUpperCase();     });      jb.writeAll(files, 0); // writing entire content from files array     jb.saveAs('sample.new.tar'); // saving file under given name   }); }); Run or edit it on JSBin. Show me amazing use-cases! Advanced demo that shows abilities and performance of jBinary - Apple HTTP Live Streaming player which converts MPEG-TS video chunks from realtime stream to MP4 and plays them immediately one by one while converting few more chunks in background. A World of Warcraft Model Viewer. It uses jDataView+jBinary to read the binary file and then WebGL to display it. Also check out jBinary.Repo for advanced usage and demos of some popular file formats (and feel free to submit more!). What license is it issued under? This library is provided under MIT license.

Both are the standard build of Sugar that includes default packages. release/sugar-full.min.js and release/sugar-full.dev.js include all packages. These pre-built scripts correspond to what is available on customize page on the main site. In node, simply use npm install sugar for the full build. Upgrading If you are upgrading from an older version, please have a look at CAUTION.md which is a vetted changelog that details the severity of what has changed, and (sometimes) strategies for migrating. Going through this before you upgrade can make the process a lot less painful! Also please refer there for notes about a patch that applies to versions prior to v1.3.9. Edge Build Public stable releases will be made available on the site and also exist in release/. Any push made to master branch should have its unit tests passing, although maybe not in all browsing environments (IE, etc) to ensure that it is stable, at least to a certain degree. Custom Builds Sugar allows custom builds that let you opt in or out packages. This can be done here. Custom builds can also be created with script/create_build.rb. With ruby installed, simply call: ruby script/create_build.rb --packages string,array  listing the packages you want to include. The advantage of using this script is that it will perform all the minification on the fly, providing more fine-grained control by allowing you to manipulate the source code in lib/ before building. If you want to remove specific methods from a package, you can do it this way. Be careful about removing dependencies however. Both lib/core/core.js and lib/common.js are required and will be added automatically. Be careful about removing methods in here as many methods are depended on by multiple packages. Unit Tests Node Use the npm test command to run unit tests. Date Localizations Sugar has the following localizations available: Danish (da) Dutch (nl) English (en) Finnish (fi) French (fr) German (de) Italian (it) Japanese (ja) Korean (ko) Polish (pl) Portuguese (pt) Russian (ru) Spanish (es) Swedish (sv) Simplified Chinese (zh-CN) Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) These files can be added separately or built into the main package on the customize page. In addition to these major locales, custom locales can be added using: Date.addLocale(LOCALE_CODE, LOCALIZATION_OBJECT)  Documentation for this available here. Also refer to lib/locales for examples of what kind of data and formats are required in localization objects. All localizations, including those not found in the main package will be kept here. Timezones Dealing with timezones in Javascript can be tricky. Although timezones are outside the scope of Sugar, it does provide a hook that can allow timezone shifted dates to be used internally in place of normal ones. See the date reference for more. Contributing Locales If you do add a custom format for your locale, please consider forking and adding it to the repo! This especially includes the addition of new locales, but also new formats or tweaks to existing locales. When adding a locale contribution, the most important thing is to add unit tests that assert the correct format. These unit tests are found in test/environments/sugar/. Simply add or adjust the formats for the locale (the more tests, the better!) and issue me a pull request. Have a look at other unit tests files for an example of the unit testing format. Contributing Lib Comparisons Lib comparisons to various other libraries can be seen at http://sugarjs.com/libs. To contribute simply find or create the appropriate lib name in docs/libs, and follow the format provided. This will be an ongoing process, and changes will be pushed out every so often. Other Contributions For other contributions, please add well formed unit tests to test/environments/sugar/. Unit tests can be run directly in the browser from test/default.html, and should all be passing in all major browsers (Webkit,Mozilla,Opera, and IE6+). Node.js unit tests should also be passing and can be run in the console with npm test. Also note that the source code is in the lib/ directory, and release is automatically built, so there is no need to changes files there.

It has no external dependencies, so you can get started right away with: <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""lazy.js""></script>  <!-- optional: if you want support for DOM event and AJAX-based sequences: --> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""lazy.browser.js""></script> Or, if you're using Node.js: var Lazy = require('lazy.js'); Now let's look at what you can do with Lazy.js. (For more thorough information, take a look at the API Docs.) Introduction Let's start with an array of objects representing people. var people = getBigArrayOfPeople(); Suppose we're using this array to back some sort of search-as-you-type functionality, where users can search for people by their last names. Naturally we want to put some reasonable constraints on our problem space, so we'll provide up to 5 results at a time. Supposing the user types ""Smith"", we could therefore fetch results using something like this (using Underscore): var results = _.chain(people)   .pluck('lastName')   .filter(function(name) { return name.startsWith('Smith'); })   .take(5)   .value(); This query does a lot of stuff: pluck('lastName'): iterates over the array and creates a new (potentially giant) array filter(...): iterates over the new array, creating yet another (potentially giant) array take(5): all that just for 5 elements! So if performance and/or efficiency were a concern for you, you would probably not do things that way using Underscore. Instead, you'd likely go the procedural route: var results = []; for (var i = 0; i < people.length; ++i) {   if (people[i].lastName.startsWith('Smith')) {     results.push(people[i].lastName);     if (results.length === 5) {       break;     }   } } There—now we haven't created any extraneous arrays, and we did all of the work in one iteration. Any problems? Well, yeah. The main problem is that this is one-off code, which isn't reusable or particularly readable. If only we could somehow leverage the expressive power of Underscore but still get the performance of the hand-written procedural solution... That's where Lazy.js comes in! Here's how we'd write the above query using Lazy.js: var result = Lazy(people)   .pluck('lastName')   .filter(function(name) { return name.startsWith('Smith'); })   .take(5); Looks almost identical, right? That's the idea: Lazy.js aims to be completely familiar to JavaScript devs experienced with Underscore or Lodash. Every method from Underscore should have the same name and (almost) identical behavior in Lazy.js, except that instead of returning a fully-populated array on every call, it creates a sequence object with an each method. What's important here is that no iteration takes place until you call each, and no intermediate arrays are created. Essentially Lazy.js combines all query operations into a ""sequence"" that behaves quite a bit like the procedural code we wrote a moment ago. (If you ever do want an array, simply call toArray on the resulting sequence.) Of course, unlike the procedural approach, Lazy.js lets you keep your code clean and functional, and focus on solving whatever problem you're actually trying to solve instead of optimizing array traversals. Features So, Lazy.js is basically Underscore with lazy evaluation. Is that it? Nope! Indefinite sequence generation The sequence-based paradigm of Lazy.js lets you do some pretty cool things that simply aren't possible with Underscore's array-based approach. One of these is the generation of indefinite sequences, which can go on forever, yet still support all of Lazy's built-in mapping and filtering capabilities. Here's an example. Let's say we want 300 unique random numbers between 1 and 1000. Lazy.generate(Math.random)   .map(function(e) { return Math.floor(e * 1000) + 1; })   .uniq()   .take(300)   .each(function(e) { console.log(e); }); Here's a slightly more advanced example: let's use Lazy.js to make a Fibonacci sequence. var fibonacci = Lazy.generate(function() {   var x = 1,       y = 1;   return function() {     var prev = x;     x = y;     y += prev;     return prev;   }; }());  // Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55] fibonacci.take(10).toArray(); OK, what else? Asynchronous iteration You've probably seen code snippets before that show how to iterate over an array asynchronously in JavaScript. But have you seen an example with functional goodness like this? Lazy.generate(Lazy.identity)   .async(1000) // specifies a 1-second interval between each element   .map(function(x) { return String.fromCharCode(x + 65); })   .take(26)   .each(function(char) { console.log(char); }); All right... what else? Event sequences With indefinite sequences, we saw that unlike Underscore and Lodash, Lazy.js doesn't actually need an in-memory collection to iterate over. And asynchronous sequences demonstrate that it also doesn't need to do all its iteration at once. Now here's a really cool combination of these two features: with a small extension to Lazy.js (lazy.browser.js, a separate file to include in browser-based environments), you can apply all of the power of Lazy.js to handling DOM events. In other words, Lazy.js lets you think of DOM events as a sequence—just like any other—and apply the usual map, filter, etc. functions on that sequence. Here's an example. Let's say we want to handle all mousemove events on a given DOM element, and show their coordinates in one of two other DOM elements depending on location. // First we define our ""sequence"" of events. var mouseEvents = Lazy(sourceElement).on(""mousemove"");  // Map the Event objects to their coordinates, relative to the element. var coordinates = mouseEvents.map(function(e) {   var elementRect = sourceElement.getBoundingClientRect();   return [     Math.floor(e.clientX - elementRect.left),     Math.floor(e.clientY - elementRect.top)   ]; });  // For mouse events on one side of the element, display the coordinates in one place. coordinates   .filter(function(pos) { return pos[0] < sourceElement.clientWidth / 2; })   .each(function(pos) { displayCoordinates(leftElement, pos); });  // For those on the other side, display them in a different place. coordinates   .filter(function(pos) { return pos[0] > sourceElement.clientWidth / 2; })   .each(function(pos) { displayCoordinates(rightElement, pos); }); Anything else? Of course! String processing Now here's something you may not have even thought of: String.match and String.split. In JavaScript, each of these methods returns an array of substrings. If you think about it, this often means doing more work than necessary; but it's the quickest way (from a developer's standpoint) to get the job done. For example, suppose you wanted the first five lines of a block of text. You could always do this: var firstFiveLines = text.split(""\n"").slice(0, 5); But of course, this actually splits the entire string into every single line. If the string is very large, this is quite wasteful. With Lazy.js, we don't need to split up an entire string just to treat it as a sequence of lines. We can get the same effect by wrapping the string with Lazy and calling split: var firstFiveLines = Lazy(text).split(""\n"").take(5); This way we can read the first five lines of an arbitrarily large string (without pre-populating a huge array) and map/reduce on it just as with any other sequence. Similarly with String.match: let's say we wanted to find the first 5 alphanumeric matches in a string. With Lazy.js, it's easy! var firstFiveWords = Lazy(text).match(/[a-z0-9]+/i).take(5); Piece of cake. Stream processing Lazy.js can wrap streams in Node.js as well. Given any Readable Stream, you can wrap it with Lazy just as with arrays: Lazy(stream)   .take(5) // Read just the first 5 chunks of data read into the buffer.   .each(processData); For convenience, specialized helper methods for dealing with either file streams or HTTP streams are also offered. (Note: this API will probably change.) // Read the first 5 lines from a file: Lazy.readFile(""path/to/file"")   .lines()   .take(5)   .each(doSomething);  // Read lines 5-10 from an HTTP response. Lazy.makeHttpRequest(""http://example.com"")   .lines()   .drop(5)   .take(5)   .each(doSomething); In each case, the elements in the sequence will be ""chunks"" of data most likely comprising multiple lines. The lines() method splits each chunk into lines (lazily, of course). This library is experimental and still a work in progress. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Why Ramda? There are already several excellent libraries with a functional flavor. Typically, they are meant to be general-purpose toolkits, suitable for working in multiple paradigms. Ramda has a more focused goal. We wanted a library designed specifically for a functional programming style, one that makes it easy to create functional pipelines, one that never mutates user data. What's Different? The primary distinguishing features of Ramda are: Ramda emphasizes a purer functional style. Immutability and side-effect free functions are at the heart of its design philosophy. This can help you get the job done with simple, elegant code. Ramda functions are automatically curried. This allows you to easily build up new functions from old ones simply by not supplying the final parameters. The parameters to Ramda functions are arranged to make it convenient for currying. The data to be operated on is generally supplied last. The last two points together make it very easy to build functions as sequences of simpler functions, each of which transforms the data and passes it along to the next. Ramda is designed to support this style of coding. Also see Why Ramda?, Why Curry Helps and Hey Underscore, You're Doing It Wrong!. Philosophy Using Ramda should feel much like just using Javascript. It is practical, functional Javascript. We're not introducing lambda expressions in strings, we're not borrowing consed lists, we're not porting over all of the Clojure functions. Our basic data structures are plain Javascript objects, and our usual collections are Javascript arrays. We also keep other native features of Javascript, such as functions as objects with properties. Functional programming is in good part about immutable objects and side-effect free functions. While Ramda does not enforce this, it enables such style to be as frictionless as possible. We aim for an implementation both clean and elegant, but the API is king. We sacrifice a great deal of implementation elegance for even a slightly cleaner API. Last but not least, Ramda strives for performance. A reliable and quick implementation wins over any notions of functional purity. Installation To use with node: $ npm install ramda Then in the console: var R = require('ramda'); To use directly in the browser: <script src=""path/to/yourCopyOf/ramda.js""></script> or the minified version: <script src=""path/to/yourCopyOf/ramda.min.js""></script> or from a CDN, either cdnjs: <script src=""//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ramda/0.18.0/ramda.min.js""></script> or one of the below links from jsDelivr: <script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/ramda/0.18.0/ramda.min.js""></script> <script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/ramda/0.18/ramda.min.js""></script> <script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/ramda/latest/ramda.min.js""></script> (note that using latest is taking a significant risk that ramda API changes could break your code.) These script tags add the variable R on the browser's global scope. Or you can inject ramda into virtually any unsuspecting website using the bookmarklet. Build on Unix-based platforms, npm run build updates dist/ramda.js and dist/ramda.min.js on Windows, write the output of scripts/build --complete to a temporary file, then rename the temporary file dist/ramda.js. Partial Builds It is possible to build Ramda with a subset of the functionality to reduce its file size. Ramda's build system supports this with command line flags. For example if you're using R.compose, R.reduce, and R.filter you can create a partial build with: ./scripts/build -- src/compose.js src/reduce.js src/filter.js > dist/ramda.custom.js  This requires having Node/io.js installed. Documentation Please review the API documentation. Introductions Introducing Ramda by Buzz de Cafe Why Ramda? by Scott Sauyet Favoring Curry by Scott Sauyet The Name Ok, so we like sheep. That's all. It's a short name, not already taken. It could as easily have been eweda, but then we would be forced to say eweda lamb!, and no one wants that. For non-English speakers, lambs are baby sheep, ewes are female sheep, and rams are male sheep. So perhaps ramda is a grown-up lambda... but probably not. Running The Test Suite Console: To run the test suite from the console, you need to have mocha installed: npm install -g mocha  Then from the root of the project, you can just call mocha  Alternately, if you've installed the dependencies, via: npm install  then you can run the tests (and get detailed output) by running: npm test  Browser: To run the test suite in the browser, you can simply open test/index.html. Alternatively, you can use testem to test across different browsers (or even headlessly), with livereloading of tests too. Install testem (npm install -g testem) and run testem. Open the link provided in your browser and you will see the results in your terminal. If you have PhantomJS installed, you can run testem -l phantomjs to run the tests completely headlessly.

The Need to go Reactive Applications, especially on the web have changed over the years from being a simple static page, to DHTML with animations, to the Ajax revolution. Each time, we're adding more complexity, more data, and asynchronous behavior to our applications. How do we manage it all? How do we scale it? By moving towards ""Reactive Architectures"" which are event-driven, resilient and responsive. With the Reactive Extensions, you have all the tools you need to help build these systems. About the Reactive Extensions The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) is a set of libraries for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and fluent query operators that many of you already know by Array#extras in JavaScript. Using RxJS, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous data streams using our many operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers. Simply put, RxJS = Observables + Operators + Schedulers. Whether you are authoring a web-based application in JavaScript or a server-side application in Node.js, you have to deal with asynchronous and event-based programming. Although some patterns are emerging such as the Promise pattern, handling exceptions, cancellation, and synchronization is difficult and error-prone. Using RxJS, you can represent multiple asynchronous data streams (that come from diverse sources, e.g., stock quote, tweets, computer events, web service requests, etc.), and subscribe to the event stream using the Observer object. The Observable notifies the subscribed Observer instance whenever an event occurs. Because observable sequences are data streams, you can query them using standard query operators implemented by the Observable type. Thus you can filter, project, aggregate, compose and perform time-based operations on multiple events easily by using these operators. In addition, there are a number of other reactive stream specific operators that allow powerful queries to be written. Cancellation, exceptions, and synchronization are also handled gracefully by using the methods on the Observable object. But the best news of all is that you already know how to program like this. Take for example the following JavaScript code, where we get some stock data and then manipulate and iterate the results. /* Get stock data somehow */ const source = getAsyncStockData();  const subscription = source   .filter(quote => quote.price > 30)   .map(quote => quote.price)   .forEach(price => console.log(`Prices higher than $30: ${price}`); Now what if this data were to come as some sort of event, for example a stream, such as a WebSocket? Then we could pretty much write the same query to iterate our data, with very little change. /* Get stock data somehow */ const source = getAsyncStockData();  const subscription = source   .filter(quote => quote.price > 30)   .map(quote => quote.price)   .subscribe(     price => console.log(`Prices higher than $30: ${price}`),     err => console.log(`Something went wrong: ${err.message}`);   );  /* When we're done */ subscription.dispose(); The only difference is that we can handle the errors inline with our subscription. And when we're no longer interested in receiving the data as it comes streaming in, we call dispose on our subscription. Note the use of subscribe instead of forEach. We could also use forEach which is an alias for subscribe but we highly suggest you use subscribe. Batteries Included Sure, there are a lot of libraries to get started with RxJS. Confused on where to get started? Start out with the complete set of operators with rx.all.js, then you can reduce it to the number of operators that you really need, and perhaps stick with something as small as rx.lite.js. If you're an implementor of RxJS, then you can start out with rx.core.js. This set of libraries include: The complete library: rx.all.js Main Libraries: rx.js rx.aggregates.js rx.async.js rx.binding.js rx.coincidence.js rx.experimental.js rx.joinpatterns.js rx.testing.js rx.time.js rx.virtualtime.js Lite Libraries: rx.lite.js rx.lite.extras.js rx.lite.aggregates.js rx.lite.async.js rx.lite.coincidence.js rx.lite.experimental.js rx.lite.joinpatterns.js rx.lite.testing.js rx.lite.time.js rx.lite.virtualtime.js Core Libraries: rx.core.js rx.core.binding.js rx.core.testing.js Why RxJS? One question you may ask yourself is why RxJS? What about Promises? Promises are good for solving asynchronous operations such as querying a service with an XMLHttpRequest, where the expected behavior is one value and then completion. Reactive Extensions for JavaScript unify both the world of Promises, callbacks as well as evented data such as DOM Input, Web Workers, and Web Sockets. Unifying these concepts enables rich composition. To give you an idea about rich composition, we can create an autocompletion service which takes user input from a text input and then throttles queries a service (to avoid flooding the service with calls for every key stroke). First, we'll reference the JavaScript files, including jQuery, although RxJS has no dependencies on jQuery... <script src=""https://code.jquery.com/jquery.js""></script> <script src=""rx.lite.js""></script> Next, we'll get the user input from an input, listening to the keyup event by using the Rx.Observable.fromEvent method. This will either use the event binding from jQuery, Zepto, AngularJS, Backbone.js and Ember.js if available, and if not, falls back to the native event binding. This gives you consistent ways of thinking of events depending on your framework, so there are no surprises. const $input = $('#input'); const $results = $('#results');  /* Only get the value from each key up */ var keyups = Rx.Observable.fromEvent($input, 'keyup')   .pluck('target', 'value')   .filter(text => text.length > 2 );  /* Now debounce the input for 500ms */ var debounced = keyups   .debounce(500 /* ms */);  /* Now get only distinct values, so we eliminate the arrows and other control characters */ var distinct = debounced   .distinctUntilChanged(); Now, let's query Wikipedia! In RxJS, we can instantly bind to any Promises A+ implementation through the Rx.Observable.fromPromise method. Or, directly return it and RxJS will wrap it for you. function searchWikipedia (term) {   return $.ajax({     url: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php',     dataType: 'jsonp',     data: {       action: 'opensearch',       format: 'json',       search: term     }   }).promise(); } Once that is created, we can tie together the distinct throttled input and query the service. In this case, we'll call flatMapLatest to get the value and ensure we're not introducing any out of order sequence calls. var suggestions = distinct   .flatMapLatest(searchWikipedia); Finally, we call the subscribe method on our observable sequence to start pulling data. suggestions.subscribe(   data => {     $results       .empty()       .append($.map(data[1], value =>  $('<li>').text(value)))   },   error=> {     $results       .empty()       .append($('<li>'))         .text('Error:' + error);   }); And there you have it!

Turns your event spaghetti into clean and declarative feng shui bacon, by switching from imperative to functional. It's like replacing nested for-loops with functional programming concepts like map and filter. Stop working on individual events and work with event streams instead. Combine your data with merge and combine. Then switch to the heavier weapons and wield flatMap and combineTemplate like a boss. It's the _ of Events.

Visual Studio users can obtain version 0.7.76 via NuGet Packages https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bacon.js/0.7.76 Intro The idea of Functional Reactive Programming is quite well described by Conal Elliot at Stack Overflow. Bacon.js is a library for functional reactive programming. Or let's say it's a library for working with events and dynamic values (which are called Properties in Bacon.js). Anyways, you can wrap an event source, say ""mouse clicks on an element"" into an EventStream by saying var clicks = $(""h1"").asEventStream(""click"") Each EventStream represents a stream of events. It is an Observable object, meaning that you can listen to events in the stream using, for instance, the onValue method with a callback. Like this: clicks.onValue(function() { alert(""you clicked the h1 element"") }) But you can do neater stuff too. The Bacon of bacon.js is in that you can transform, filter and combine these streams in a multitude of ways (see API below). The methods map, filter, for example, are similar to same functions in functional list programming (like Underscore). So, if you say var plus = $(""#plus"").asEventStream(""click"").map(1) var minus = $(""#minus"").asEventStream(""click"").map(-1) var both = plus.merge(minus) .. you'll have a stream that will output the number 1 when the ""plus"" button is clicked and another stream outputting -1 when the ""minus"" button is clicked. The both stream will be a merged stream containing events from both the plus and minus streams. This allows you to subscribe to both streams with one handler: both.onValue(function(val) { /* val will be 1 or -1 */ }) In addition to EventStreams, bacon.js has a thing called Property, that is almost like an EventStream, but has a ""current value"". So things that change and have a current state are Properties, while things that consist of discrete events are EventStreams. You could think mouse clicks as an EventStream and mouse position as a Property. You can create Properties from an EventStream with scan or toProperty methods. So, let's say function add(x, y) { return x + y } var counter = both.scan(0, add) counter.onValue(function(sum) { $(""#sum"").text(sum) }) The counter property will contain the sum of the values in the both stream, so it's practically a counter that can be increased and decreased using the plus and minus buttons. The scan method was used here to calculate the ""current sum"" of events in the both stream, by giving a ""seed value"" 0 and an ""accumulator function"" add. The scan method creates a property that starts with the given seed value and on each event in the source stream applies the accumulator function to the current property value and the new value from the stream. Properties can be very conveniently used for assigning values and attributes to DOM elements with JQuery. Here we assign the value of a property as the text of a span element whenever it changes: property.assign($(""span""), ""text"") Hiding and showing the same span depending on the content of the property value is equally straightforward function hiddenForEmptyValue(value) { return value == """" ? ""hidden"" : ""visible"" } property.map(hiddenForEmptyValue).assign($(""span""), ""css"", ""visibility"") In the example above a property value of ""hello"" would be mapped to ""visible"", which in turn would result in Bacon calling $(""span"").css(""visibility"", ""visible"") For an actual tutorial, please check out my blog posts API Creating streams $.asEventStream(eventName) creates an EventStream from events on a jQuery or Zepto.js object. You can pass optional arguments to add a jQuery live selector and/or a function that processes the jQuery event and its parameters, if given, like this: $(""#my-div"").asEventStream(""click"", "".more-specific-selector"") $(""#my-div"").asEventStream(""click"", "".more-specific-selector"", function(event, args) { return args[0] }) $(""#my-div"").asEventStream(""click"", function(event, args) { return args[0] }) Bacon.fromPromise(promise [, abort] [, eventTransformer]) creates an EventStream from a Promise object such as JQuery Ajax. This stream will contain a single value or an error, followed immediately by stream end. You can use the optional abort flag (i.e. ´fromPromise(p, true)´ to have the abort method of the given promise be called when all subscribers have been removed from the created stream. You can also pass an optional function that transforms the promise value into Events. The default is to transform the value into [new Bacon.Next(value), new Bacon.End()]. Check out this example. Bacon.fromEvent(target, eventName [, eventTransformer]) creates an EventStream from events on a DOM EventTarget or Node.JS EventEmitter object, or an object that supports event listeners using on/off methods. You can also pass an optional function that transforms the emitted events' parameters. Bacon.fromEvent(document.body, ""click"").onValue(function() { alert(""Bacon!"") }) Bacon.fromCallback(f [, args...]) creates an EventStream from a function that accepts a callback. The function is supposed to call its callback just once. For example: Bacon.fromCallback(function(callback) {   setTimeout(function() {     callback(""Bacon!"")   }, 1000) }) This would create a stream that outputs a single value ""Bacon!"" and ends after that. The use of setTimeout causes the value to be delayed by 1 second. You can also give any number of arguments to fromCallback, which will be passed to the function. These arguments can be simple variables, Bacon EventStreams or Properties. For example the following will output ""Bacon rules"": bacon = Bacon.constant('bacon') Bacon.fromCallback(function(a, b, callback) {   callback(a + ' ' + b); }, bacon, 'rules').log(); Bacon.fromCallback(object, methodName [, args...]) a variant of fromCallback which calls the named method of a given object. Bacon.fromNodeCallback(f [, args...]) behaves the same way as Bacon.fromCallback, except that it expects the callback to be called in the Node.js convention: callback(error, data), where error is null if everything is fine. For example: var Bacon = require('baconjs').Bacon,     fs = require('fs'); var read = Bacon.fromNodeCallback(fs.readFile, 'input.txt'); read.onError(function(error) { console.log(""Reading failed: "" + error); }); read.onValue(function(value) { console.log(""Read contents: "" + value); }); Bacon.fromNodeCallback(object, methodName [, args...]) a variant of fromNodeCallback which calls the named method of a given object. Bacon.fromPoll(interval, f) polls given function with given interval. Function should return Events: either Bacon.Next or Bacon.End. Polling occurs only when there are subscribers to the stream. Polling ends permanently when f returns Bacon.End. Bacon.once(value) creates an EventStream that delivers the given single value for the first subscriber. The stream will end immediately after this value. You can also send an Bacon.Error event instead of a value: Bacon.once(new Bacon.Error(""fail"")). Bacon.fromArray(values) creates an EventStream that delivers the given series of values (given as array) to the first subscriber. The stream ends after these values have been delivered. You can also send Bacon.Error events, or any combination of pure values and error events like this: `Bacon.fromArray([1, new Bacon.Error()]) Bacon.interval(interval, value) repeats the single element indefinitely with the given interval (in milliseconds) Bacon.sequentially(interval, values) creates a stream containing given values (given as array). Delivered with given interval in milliseconds. Bacon.repeatedly(interval, values) repeats given elements indefinitely with given interval in milliseconds. For example, repeatedly(10, [1,2,3]) would lead to 1,2,3,1,2,3... to be repeated indefinitely. Bacon.repeat(fn) Calls generator function which is expected to return an observable. The returned EventStream contains values and errors from the spawned observable. When the spawned observable ends, the generator is called again to spawn a new observable. This is repeated until the generator returns a falsy value (such as undefined or false). The generator function is called with one argument — iteration number starting from 0. Here's an example: Bacon.repeat(function(i) {   if (i < 3) {     return Bacon.once(i);   } else {     return false;   } }).log() The example will produce values 0, 1 and 2. Bacon.never() creates an EventStream that immediately ends. Bacon.later(delay, value) creates a single-element stream that produces given value after given delay (milliseconds). new Bacon.EventStream(subscribe) creates an EventStream with the given subscribe function. property.changes creates a stream of changes to the Property. The stream does not include an event for the current value of the Property at the time this method was called. property.toEventStream() creates an EventStream based on this Property. The stream contains also an event for the current value of this Property at the time this method was called. new Bacon.Bus() creates a pushable/pluggable stream (see Bus section below) Pro tip: you can also put Errors into streams created with the constructors above, by using an Bacon.Error object instead of a plain value. Bacon.fromBinder for custom streams If none of the factory methods above apply, you may of course roll your own EventStream by using Bacon.fromBinder. Bacon.fromBinder(subscribe) The parameter subscribe is a function that accepts a sink which is a function that your subscribe function can ""push"" events to. For example: var stream = Bacon.fromBinder(function(sink) {   sink(""first value"")   sink([new Bacon.Next(""2nd""), new Bacon.Next(""3rd"")])   sink(new Bacon.Next(function() {     return ""This one will be evaluated lazily""   }))   sink(new Bacon.Error(""oops, an error""))   sink(new Bacon.End())   return function() {      // unsub functionality here, this one's a no-op   } }) stream.log() As shown in the example, you can push A plain value, like ""first value"" An Event object including Bacon.Error (wraps an error) and Bacon.End (indicates stream end). An array of event objects at once Other examples can be found on JSFiddle and the Bacon.js blog. The subscribe function must return a function. Let's call that function unsubscribe. The returned function can be used by the subscriber (directly or indirectly) to unsubscribe from the EventStream. It should release all resources that the subscribe function reserved. The sink function may return Bacon.noMore (as well as Bacon.more or any other value). If it returns Bacon.noMore, no further events will be consumed by the subscriber. The subscribe function may choose to clean up all resources at this point (e.g., by calling unsubscribe). This is usually not necessary, because further calls to sink are ignored, but doing so can increase performance in rare cases. The EventStream will wrap your subscribe function so that it will only be called when the first stream listener is added, and the unsubscribe function is called only after the last listener has been removed. The subscribe-unsubscribe cycle may of course be repeated indefinitely, so prepare for multiple calls to the subscribe function. A note about the new Bacon.Next(..) constructor: You can use it like new Bacon.Next(""value"") But the canonical way would be new Bacon.Next(function() { return ""value""; }) The former version is safe only when you know that the actual value in the stream is not a function. The idea in using a function instead of a plain value is that the internals on Bacon.js take advantage of lazy evaluation by deferring the evaluations of values created by map, combine. Bacon.noMore The opaque value sink function may return. See Bacon.fromBinder. Bacon.more The opaque value sink function may return. See Bacon.fromBinder. Common methods in EventStreams and Properties Both EventStream and Property share the Observable interface, and hence share a lot of methods. Methods typically return observables so that methods can be chained; exceptions are noted. Common methods are listed below. observable.subscribe(f) subscribes given handler function to event stream. Function will receive Event objects (see below). The subscribe() call returns a unsubscribe function that you can call to unsubscribe. You can also unsubscribe by returning Bacon.noMore from the handler function as a reply to an Event. stream.subscribe and property.subscribe behave similarly, except that the latter also pushes the initial value of the property, in case there is one. observable.onValue(f) subscribes a given handler function to the observable. Function will be called for each new value. This is the simplest way to assign a side-effect to an observable. The difference to the subscribe method is that the actual stream values are received, instead of Event objects. The Function Construction rules below apply here. Just like subscribe, this method returns a function for unsubscribing. stream.onValue and property.onValue behave similarly, except that the latter also pushes the initial value of the property, in case there is one. observable.onValues(f) like onValue, but splits the value (assuming its an array) as function arguments to f. observable.onError(f) subscribes a callback to error events. The function will be called for each error in the stream. Just like subscribe, this method returns a function for unsubscribing. observable.onEnd(f) subscribes a callback to stream end. The function will be called when the stream ends. Just like subscribe, this method returns a function for unsubscribing. observable.toPromise([PromiseCtr]) returns a Promise which will be resolved with the last event coming from an Observable. The global ES6 promise implementation will be used unless a promise constructor is given. Use a shim if you need to support legacy browsers or platforms. caniuse promises. observable.firstToPromise([PromiseCtr]) returns a Promise which will be resolved with the first event coming from an Observable. Like toPromise, the global ES6 promise implementation will be used unless a promise constructor is given. observable.map(f) maps values using given function, returning a new stream/property. Instead of a function, you can also provide a constant value. Further, you can use a property extractor string like "".keyCode"". So, if f is a string starting with a dot, the elements will be mapped to the corresponding field/function in the event value. For instance map("".keyCode"") will pluck the keyCode field from the input values. If keyCode was a function, the result stream would contain the values returned by the function. The Function Construction rules below apply here. The map method, among many others, uses lazy evaluation. stream.map(property) maps the stream events to the current value of the given property. This is equivalent to property.sampledBy(stream). observable.mapError(f) maps errors using given function. More specifically, feeds the ""error"" field of the error event to the function and produces a Next event based on the return value. The Function Construction rules below apply here. You can omit the argument to produce a Next event with undefined value. observable.errors() returns a stream containing Error events only. Same as filtering with a function that always returns false. observable.skipErrors() skips all errors. observable.mapEnd(f) Adds an extra Next event just before End. The value is created by calling the given function when the source stream ends. Instead of a function, a static value can be used. You can omit the argument to produce a Next event with undefined value. observable.filter(f) filters values using given predicate function. Instead of a function, you can use a constant value (true to include all, false to exclude all) or a property extractor string (like "".isValuable"") instead. Just like with map, indeed. observable.filter(property) filters values based on the value of a property. Event will be included in output if and only if the property holds true at the time of the event. observable.skipDuplicates(isEqual) drops consecutive equal elements. So, from [1, 2, 2, 1] you'd get [1, 2, 1]. Uses the === operator for equality checking by default. If the isEqual argument is supplied, checks by calling isEqual(oldValue, newValue). For instance, to do a deep comparison,you can use the isEqual function from underscore.js like stream.skipDuplicates(_.isEqual). observable.take(n) takes at most n values from the stream and then ends the stream. If the stream has fewer than n values then it is unaffected. Equal to Bacon.never() if n <= 0. observable.takeUntil(stream) takes elements from source until a Next event appears in the other stream. If other stream ends without value, it is ignored. observable.takeWhile(f) takes while given predicate function holds true, and then ends. Function Construction rules apply. observable.takeWhile(property) takes values while the value of a property holds true, and then ends. observable.first() takes the first element from the stream. Essentially observable.take(1). observable.last() takes the last element from the stream. None, if stream is empty. Note: neverEndingStream.last() creates the stream which doesn't produce any events and never ends. observable.skip(n) skips the first n elements from the stream observable.delay(delay) delays the stream/property by given amount of milliseconds. Does not delay the initial value of a Property. var delayed = source.delay(2) source:    asdf----asdf---- delayed:   --asdf----asdf--  observable.throttle(delay) throttles stream/property by given amount of milliseconds. Events are emitted with the minimum interval of delay. The implementation is based on stream.bufferWithTime. Does not affect emitting the initial value of a Property. Example: var throttled = source.throttle(2) source:    asdf----asdf---- throttled: --s--f----s--f--  observable.debounce(delay) throttles stream/property by given amount of milliseconds, but so that event is only emitted after the given ""quiet period"". Does not affect emitting the initial value of a Property. The difference of throttle and debounce is the same as it is in the same methods in jQuery. Example: source:             asdf----asdf---- source.debounce(2): -----f-------f--  observable.debounceImmediate(delay) passes the first event in the stream through, but after that, only passes events after a given number of milliseconds have passed since previous output. Example: source:                      asdf----asdf---- source.debounceImmediate(2): a-d-----a-d-----  observable.bufferingThrottle(minimumInterval) throttles the observable using a buffer so that at most one value event in minimumInteval is issued. Unlike throttle, it doesn't discard the excessive events but buffers them instead, outputting them with a rate of at most one value per minimumInterval. Example: var throttled = source.bufferingThrottle(2) source:    asdf----asdf---- throttled: a-s-d-f-a-s-d-f-  observable.doAction(f) returns a stream/property where the function f is executed for each value, before dispatching to subscribers. This is useful for debugging, but also for stuff like calling the preventDefault() method for events. In fact, you can also use a property-extractor string instead of a function, as in "".preventDefault"". observable.doError(f) returns a stream/property where the function f is executed for each error, before dispatching to subscribers. That is, same as doAction but for errors. observable.not() returns a stream/property that inverts boolean values observable.flatMap(f) for each element in the source stream, spawn a new stream using the function f. Collect events from each of the spawned streams into the result EventStream. Note that instead of a function, you can provide a stream/property too. Also, the return value of function f can be either an Observable (stream/property) or a constant value. The result of flatMap is always an EventStream. The Function Construction rules below apply here. stream.flatMap() can be used conveniently with Bacon.once() and Bacon.never() for converting and filtering at the same time, including only some of the results. Example - converting strings to integers, skipping empty values: stream.flatMap(function(text) {     return (text != """") ? parseInt(text) : Bacon.never() }) observable.flatMapLatest(f) like flatMap, but instead of including events from all spawned streams, only includes them from the latest spawned stream. You can think this as switching from stream to stream. Note that instead of a function, you can provide a stream/property too. The Function Construction rules below apply here. observable.flatMapFirst(f) like flatMap, but only spawns a new stream if the previously spawned stream has ended. The Function Construction rules below apply here. observable.flatMapError(f) like flatMap, but is applied only on Error events. Returned values go into the value stream, unless an error event is returned. As an example, one type of error could result in a retry and another just passed through, which can be implemented using flatMapError. observable.flatMapWithConcurrencyLimit(limit, f) a super method of flatMap family. It limits the number of open spawned streams and buffers incoming events. flatMapConcat is flatMapWithConcurrencyLimit(1) (only one input active), and flatMap is flatMapWithConcurrencyLimit ∞ (all inputs are piped to output). The Function Construction rules below apply here. observable.flatMapConcat(f) a flatMapWithConcurrencyLimit with limit of 1. The Function Construction rules below apply here. observable.scan(seed, f) scans stream/property with given seed value and accumulator function, resulting to a Property. For example, you might use zero as seed and a ""plus"" function as the accumulator to create an ""integral"" property. Instead of a function, you can also supply a method name such as "".concat"", in which case this method is called on the accumulator value and the new stream value is used as argument. Example: var plus = function (a,b) { return a + b } Bacon.sequentially(1, [1,2,3]).scan(0, plus) This would result to following elements in the result stream: seed value = 0 0 + 1 = 1 1 + 2 = 3 3 + 3 = 6  When applied to a Property as in r = p.scan(seed, f), there's a (hopefully insignificant) catch: The starting value for r depends on whether p has an initial value when scan is applied. If there's no initial value, this works identically to EventStream.scan: the seed will be the initial value of r. However, if r already has a current/initial value x, the seed won't be output as is. Instead, the initial value of r will be f(seed, x). This makes sense, because there can only be 1 initial value for a Property at a time. observable.fold(seed, f) is like scan but only emits the final value, i.e. the value just before the observable ends. Returns a Property. observable.reduce(seed, f) synonym for fold. observable.diff(start, f) returns a Property that represents the result of a comparison between the previous and current value of the Observable. For the initial value of the Observable, the previous value will be the given start. Example: var distance = function (a,b) { return Math.abs(b - a) } Bacon.sequentially(1, [1,2,3]).diff(0, distance) This would result to following elements in the result stream: 1 - 0 = 1 2 - 1 = 1 3 - 2 = 1  observable.zip(other [, f]) return an EventStream with elements pair-wise lined up with events from this and the other EventStream or Property. A zipped stream will publish only when it has a value from each source and will only produce values up to when any single source ends. The given function f is used to create the result value from value in the two sources. If no function is given, the values are zipped into an array. Be careful not to have too much ""drift"" between streams. If one stream produces many more values than some other excessive buffering will occur inside the zipped observable. Example 1: var x = Bacon.fromArray([1, 2]) var y = Bacon.fromArray([3, 4]) x.zip(y, function(x, y) { return x + y })  # produces values 4, 6 See also zipWith and zipAsArray for zipping more than 2 sources. observable.slidingWindow(max [, min]) returns a Property that represents a ""sliding window"" into the history of the values of the Observable. The result Property will have a value that is an array containing the last n values of the original observable, where n is at most the value of the max argument, and at least the value of the min argument. If the min argument is omitted, there's no lower limit of values. For example, if you have a stream s with value a sequence 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5, the respective values in s.slidingWindow(2) would be [] - [1] - [1,2] - [2,3] - [3,4] - [4,5]. The values of s.slidingWindow(2,2)would be [1,2] - [2,3] - [3,4] - [4,5]. observable.log() logs each value of the Observable to the console. It optionally takes arguments to pass to console.log() alongside each value. To assist with chaining, it returns the original Observable. Note that as a side-effect, the observable will have a constant listener and will not be garbage-collected. So, use this for debugging only and remove from production code. For example: myStream.log(""New event in myStream"") or just myStream.log() observable.doLog() logs each value of the Observable to the console. doLog() behaves like log but does not subscribe to the event stream. You can think of doLog() as a logger function that – unlike log() – is safe to use in production. doLog() is safe, because it does not cause the same surprising side-effects as log() does. observable.combine(property2, f) combines the latest values of the two streams or properties using a two-arg function. Similarly to scan, you can use a method name instead, so you could do a.combine(b, "".concat"") for two properties with array value. The result is a Property. observable.withStateMachine(initState, f) lets you run a state machine on an observable. Give it an initial state object and a state transformation function that processes each incoming event and returns and array containing the next state and an array of output events. Here's an an example, where we calculate the total sum of all numbers in the stream and output the value on stream end: Bacon.fromArray([1,2,3])   .withStateMachine(0, function(sum, event) {     if (event.hasValue())       return [sum + event.value(), []]     else if (event.isEnd())       return [undefined, [new Bacon.Next(sum), event]]     else       return [sum, [event]]   }) observable.decode(mapping) decodes input using the given mapping. Is a bit like a switch-case or the decode function in Oracle SQL. For example, the following would map the value 1 into the string ""mike"" and the value 2 into the value of the who property. property.decode({1 : ""mike"", 2 : who}) This is actually based on combineTemplate so you can compose static and dynamic data quite freely, as in property.decode({1 : { type: ""mike"" }, 2 : { type: ""other"", whoThen : who }}) The return value of decode is always a Property. observable.awaiting(otherObservable) creates a Property that indicates whether observable is awaiting otherObservable, i.e. has produced a value after the latest value from otherObservable. This is handy for keeping track whether we are currently awaiting an AJAX response: var showAjaxIndicator = ajaxRequest.awaiting(ajaxResponse) observable.endOnError() ends the Observable on first Error event. The error is included in the output of the returned Observable. observable.endOnError(f) ends the Observable on first Error event for which the given predicate function returns true. The error is included in the output of the returned Observable. The Function Construction rules apply, so you can do for example .endOnError("".serious""). observable.withHandler(f) lets you do more custom event handling: you get all events to your function and you can output any number of events and end the stream if you choose. For example, to send an error and end the stream in case a value is below zero: if (event.hasValue() && event.value() < 0) {   this.push(new Bacon.Error(""Value below zero""));   return this.push(end()); } else {   return this.push(event); } Note that it's important to return the value from this.push so that the connection to the underlying stream will be closed when no more events are needed. observable.name(newName) sets the name of the observable. Overrides the default implementation of toString and inspect. Returns itself. observable.withDescription(param...) Sets the structured description of the observable. The toString and inspect methods use this data recursively to create a string representation for the observable. This method is probably useful for Bacon core / library / plugin development only. For example: var src = Bacon.once(1) var obs = src.map(function(x) { return -x }) console.log(obs.toString()) --> Bacon.once(1).map(function) obs.withDescription(src, ""times"", -1) console.log(obs.toString()) --> Bacon.once(1).times(-1)  observable.groupBy(keyF [, limitF]) Groups stream events to new streams by keyF. Optional limitF can be provided to limit grouped stream life. Stream transformed by limitF is passed on if provided. limitF gets grouped stream and the original event causing the stream to start as parameters. Calculator for grouped consecutive values until group is cancelled: var events = [   {id: 1, type: ""add"", val: 3 },   {id: 2, type: ""add"", val: -1 },   {id: 1, type: ""add"", val: 2 },   {id: 2, type: ""cancel""},   {id: 3, type: ""add"", val: 2 },   {id: 3, type: ""cancel""},   {id: 1, type: ""add"", val: 1 },   {id: 1, type: ""add"", val: 2 },   {id: 1, type: ""cancel""} ]  function keyF(event) {   return event.id }  function limitF(groupedStream, groupStartingEvent) {   var cancel = groupedStream.filter(function(x) { return x.type === ""cancel""}).take(1)   var adds = groupedStream.filter(function(x) { return x.type === ""add"" })   return adds.takeUntil(cancel).map("".val"") }  Bacon.sequentially(2, events)   .groupBy(keyF, limitF)   .flatMap(function(groupedStream) {     return groupedStream.fold(0, function(acc, x) { return acc + x })   })   .onValue(function(sum) {     console.log(sum)     // returns [-1, 2, 8] in an order   })  EventStream Bacon.EventStream a stream of events. See methods below. stream.concat(otherStream) concatenates two streams into one stream so that it will deliver events from stream until it ends and then deliver events from otherStream. This means too that events from stream2, occurring before the end of stream will not be included in the result stream. stream.merge(otherStream) merges two streams into one stream that delivers events from both stream.holdWhen(valve) pauses and buffers the event stream if last event in valve is truthy. All buffered events are released when valve becomes falsy. stream.startWith(value) adds a starting value to the stream, i.e. concats a single-element stream contains value with this stream. stream.skipWhile(f) skips elements until the given predicate function returns falsy once, and then lets all events pass through. The Function Construction rules below apply here. stream.skipWhile(property) skips elements until the value of the given Property is falsy once, and then lets all events pass through. stream.skipUntil(stream2) skips elements from stream until a Next event appears in stream2. In other words, starts delivering values from stream after first event appears in stream2. stream.bufferWithTime(delay) buffers stream events with given delay. The buffer is flushed at most once in the given delay. So, if your input contains [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], then you might get two events containing [1,2,3,4] and [5,6,7] respectively, given that the flush occurs between numbers 4 and 5. stream.bufferWithTime(f) works with a given ""defer-function"" instead of a delay. Here's a simple example, which is equivalent to stream.bufferWithTime(10): stream.bufferWithTime(function(f) { setTimeout(f, 10) }) stream.bufferWithCount(count) buffers stream events with given count. The buffer is flushed when it contains the given number of elements. So, if you buffer a stream of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with count 2, you'll get output events with values [1, 2], [3, 4] and [5]. stream.bufferWithTimeOrCount(delay, count) buffers stream events and flushes when either the buffer contains the given number elements or the given amount of milliseconds has passed since last buffered event. stream.toProperty() creates a Property based on the EventStream. Without arguments, you'll get a Property without an initial value. The Property will get its first actual value from the stream, and after that it'll always have a current value. stream.toProperty(initialValue) creates a Property based on the EventStream with the given initial value that will be used as the current value until the first value comes from the stream. Property Bacon.Property a reactive property. Has the concept of ""current value"". You can create a Property from an EventStream by using either toProperty or scan method. Note: depending on how a Property is created, it may or may not have an initial value. The current value stays as its last value after the stream has ended. Bacon.constant(x) creates a constant property with value x. property.assign(obj, method [, param...]) calls the method of the given object with each value of this Property. You can optionally supply arguments which will be used as the first arguments of the method call. For instance, if you want to assign your Property to the ""disabled"" attribute of a JQuery object, you can do this: myProperty.assign($(""#my-button""), ""attr"", ""disabled"") A simpler example would be to toggle the visibility of an element based on a Property: myProperty.assign($(""#my-button""), ""toggle"") Note that the assign method is actually just a synonym for onValue and the function construction rules below apply to both. property.sample(interval) creates an EventStream by sampling the property value at given interval (in milliseconds) property.sampledBy(stream) creates an EventStream by sampling the property value at each event from the given stream. The result EventStream will contain the property value at each event in the source stream. property.sampledBy(property) creates a Property by sampling the property value at each event from the given property. The result Property will contain the property value at each event in the source property. property.sampledBy(streamOrProperty, f) samples the property on stream events. The result values will be formed using the given function f(propertyValue, samplerValue). You can use a method name (such as "".concat"") instead of a function too. property.changes() returns an EventStream of property value changes. Returns exactly the same events as the property itself, except any Initial events. Note that property.changes() does NOT skip duplicate values, use .skipDuplicates() for that. property.and(other) combines properties with the && operator. property.or(other) combines properties with the || operator. property.startWith(value) adds an initial ""default"" value for the Property. If the Property doesn't have an initial value of it's own, the given value will be used as the initial value. If the property has an initial value of its own, the given value will be ignored. Combining multiple streams and properties Bacon.combineAsArray(streams) combines Properties, EventStreams and constant values so that the result Property will have an array of all property values as its value. The input array may contain both Properties and EventStreams. In the latter case, the stream is first converted into a Property and then combined with the other properties. Bacon.combineAsArray(s1, s2...) just like above, but with streams provided as a list of arguments as opposed to a single array. property = Bacon.constant(1) stream = Bacon.once(2) constant = 3 Bacon.combineAsArray(property, stream, constant) # produces the value [1,2,3] Bacon.combineWith(f, stream1, stream2...) combines given n Properties, EventStreams and constant values using the given n-ary function f(v1, v2 ...). To calculate the current sum of three numeric Properties, you can do function sum3(x,y,z) { return x + y + z } Bacon.combineWith(sum3, p1, p2, p3) Bacon.combineWith(f, streams) like above, but with streams provided as a single array as opposed to a list of arguments. streams = [Bacon.constant(1), Bacon.constant(2)] Bacon.combineWith(Math.max, streams) Bacon.combineWith(streams, f) like above Bacon.combineWith(stream1, stream2..., f) like above Bacon.combineTemplate(template) combines Properties, EventStreams and constant values using a template object. For instance, assuming you've got streams or properties named password, username, firstname and lastname, you can do var password, username, firstname, lastname; // <- properties or streams var loginInfo = Bacon.combineTemplate({     magicNumber: 3,     userid: username,     passwd: password,     name: { first: firstname, last: lastname }}) .. and your new loginInfo property will combine values from all these streams using that template, whenever any of the streams/properties get a new value. For instance, it could yield a value such as { magicNumber: 3,   userid: ""juha"",   passwd: ""easy"",   name : { first: ""juha"", last: ""paananen"" }} In addition to combining data from streams, you can include constant values in your templates. Note that all Bacon.combine* methods produce a Property instead of an EventStream. If you need the result as an EventStream you might want to use property.changes() Bacon.combineWith(function(v1,v2) { .. }, stream1, stream2).changes() Bacon.mergeAll(streams) merges given array of EventStreams. Bacon.mergeAll(stream1, stream2 ...) merges given EventStreams. Bacon.zipAsArray(streams) zips the array of EventStreams / Properties in to a new EventStream that will have an array of values from each source as its value. Zipping means that events from each source are combined pairwise so that the 1st event from each source is published first, then the 2nd event from each. The results will be published as soon as there is a value from each source. Be careful not to have too much ""drift"" between streams. If one stream produces many more values than some other excessive buffering will occur inside the zipped observable. Example: x = Bacon.fromArray([1,2,3]) y = Bacon.fromArray([10, 20, 30]) z = Bacon.fromArray([100, 200, 300]) Bacon.zipAsArray(x, y, z)  # produces values [1, 10, 100], [2, 20, 200] and [3, 30, 300] Bacon.zipAsArray(stream1, stream2...) just like above, but with sources provided as a list of arguments as opposed to a single array. Bacon.zipWith(streams, f) like zipAsArray but uses the given n-ary function to combine the n values from n sources, instead of returning them in an Array. Bacon.zipWith(f, streams) like zipAsArray but uses the given n-ary function to combine the n values from n sources, instead of returning them in an Array. Bacon.zipWith(f, stream1, stream1...) like above Bacon.zipWith(stream1, stream1..., f) like above Bacon.onValues(a, b [, c...], f) is a shorthand for combining multiple sources (streams, properties, constants) as array and assigning the side-effect function f for the values. The following example would log the number 3. function f(a, b) { console.log(a + b) } Bacon.onValues(Bacon.constant(1), Bacon.constant(2), f) Function Construction rules Many methods in Bacon have a single function as their argument. Many of these actually accept a wider range of different arguments that they use for constructing the function. Here are the different forms you can use, with examples. The basic form would be stream.map(f) maps values using the function f(x) As an extension to the basic form, you can use partial application: stream.map(f, ""bacon"") maps values using the function f(x, y), using ""bacon"" as the first argument, and stream value as the second argument. stream.map(f, ""pow"", ""smack"") maps values using the function f(x, y, z), using ""pow"" and ""smack"" as the first two arguments and stream value as the third argument. Then, you can create method calls like this: stream.onValue(object, method) calls the method having the given name, with stream value as the argument. titleText.onValue($(""#title""), ""text"") which would call the ""text"" method of the jQuery object matching to the HTML element with the id ""title"" disableButton.onValue($(""#send""), ""attr"", ""disabled"") which would call the attr method of the #send element, with ""disabled"" as the first argument. So if your property has the value true, it would call $(""#send"").attr(""disabled"", true) You can call methods or return field values using a ""property extractor"" syntax. With this syntax, Bacon checks the type of the field and if it's indeed a method, it calls it. Otherwise it just returns field value. For example: stream.map("".length"") would return the value of the ""length"" field of stream values. Would make sense for a stream of arrays. So, you'd get 2 for [""cat"", ""dog""] stream.map("".stuffs.length"") would pick the length of the ""stuffs"" array that is a field in the stream value. For example, you'd get 2 for { stuffs : [""thing"", ""object""] } stream.map("".dudes.1"") would pick the second object from the nested ""dudes"" array. For example, you'd get ""jack"" for { dudes : [""john"", ""jack""] }. stream.doAction("".preventDefault"") would call the ""preventDefault"" method of stream values. stream.filter("".attr"", ""disabled"").not() would call .attr(""disabled"") on stream values and filter by the return value. This would practically inlude only disabled jQuery elements to the result stream. If none of the above applies, Bacon will return a constant value. For instance: mouseClicks.map({ isMouseClick: true }) would map all events to the object { isMouseClick: true } Methods that support function construction include at least onValue, onError, onEnd, map, filter, assign, takeWhile, mapError and doAction. Lazy evaluation Methods such as map and the combine use lazy evaluation to avoid evaluating values that aren't actually needed. This can be generally considered a Good Thing, but it has it's pitfalls. If you pass a function that referentially transparent, you'll be fine. This means that your function should return the same value regardless of when it's called. On the other hand, if you pass a function that returns a value depending on time, you may have problems. Consider a property contents that's derived from events like below. var items = clicks.map(getCurrentValueFromUI).toProperty() var submittedItems = items.sampledBy(submitClick) Now the submittedItems stream will produce the current value of the items property when an event occurs in the submitClick stream. Or so you'd think. In fact, the value of submittedItems is evaluated at the time of the event in the submitClick stream, which means that it will actually produce the value of getCurrentValueFromUI at that time, instead of at the time of the original click event. To force evaluation at the time of original event, you can just use flatMap instead of map. As in here. var items = clicks.flatMap(getCurrentValueFromUI).toProperty() Latest value of Property or EventStream One of the common first questions people ask is ""how do I get the latest value of a stream or a property"". There is no getLatestValue method available and will not be either. You get the value by subscribing to the stream/property and handling the values in your callback. If you need the value of more than one source, use one of the combine methods. Bus Bus is an EventStream that allows you to push values into the stream. It also allows plugging other streams into the Bus. The Bus practically merges all plugged-in streams and the values pushed using the push method. new Bacon.Bus() returns a new Bus. bus.push(x) pushes the given value to the stream. bus.end() ends the stream. Sends an End event to all subscribers. After this call, there'll be no more events to the subscribers. Also, the bus.push and bus.plug methods have no effect. bus.error(e) sends an Error with given message to all subscribers bus.plug(stream) plugs the given stream to the Bus. All events from the given stream will be delivered to the subscribers of the Bus. Returns a function that can be used to unplug the same stream. The plug method practically allows you to merge in other streams after the creation of the Bus. I've found Bus quite useful as an event broadcast mechanism in the Worzone game, for instance. Event Bacon.Event has subclasses Bacon.Next, Bacon.End, Bacon.Error and Bacon.Initial Bacon.Next next value in an EventStream or a Property. Call isNext() to distinguish a Next event from other events. Bacon.End an end-of-stream event of EventStream or Property. Call isEnd() to distinguish an End from other events. Bacon.Error an error event. Call isError() to distinguish these events in your subscriber, or use onError to react to error events only. errorEvent.error returns the associated error object (usually string). Bacon.Initial the initial (current) value of a Property. Call isInitial() to distinguish from other events. Only sent immediately after subscription to a Property. Event properties and methods event.value() returns the value associated with a Next or Initial event event.hasValue() returns true for events of type Initial and Next event.isNext() true for Next events event.isInitial() true for Initial events event.isEnd() true for End events Errors Bacon.Error events are always passed through all stream combinators. So, even if you filter all values out, the error events will pass through. If you use flatMap, the result stream will contain Error events from the source as well as all the spawned stream. You can take action on errors by using the observable.onError(f) callback. See documentation on onError, mapError, errors, skipErrors, Bacon.retry and flatMapError above. In case you want to convert (some) value events into Error events, you may use flatMap like this: stream = Bacon.fromArray([1,2,3,4]).flatMap(function(x) {   if (x > 2)     return new Bacon.Error(""too big"")   else     return x }) Conversely, if you want to convert some Error events into value events, you may use flatMapError: myStream.flatMapError(function(error) {   return isNonCriticalError(error) ? handleNonCriticalError(error) : new Bacon.Error(error) }) Note also that Bacon.js combinators do not catch errors that are thrown. Especially map doesn't do so. If you want to map things and wrap caught errors into Error events, you can do the following: wrapped = source.flatMap(Bacon.try(dangerousOperation)) For example, you can use Bacon.try to handle JSON parse errors: var jsonStream = Bacon   .once('{""this is invalid json""')   .flatMap(Bacon.try(JSON.parse))  jsonStream.onError(function(err) {   console.error(""Failed to parse JSON"", err) }) An Error does not terminate the stream. The method observable.endOnError() returns a stream/property that ends immediately after first error. Bacon.js doesn't currently generate any Error events itself (except when converting errors using Bacon.fromPromise). Error events definitely would be generated by streams derived from IO sources such as AJAX calls. Bacon.retry(options) is used to retry the call when there is an Error event in the stream produced by the source function. The two required option parameters are: source, a function that produces an Observable. retries, the number of times to retry the source function in addition to the initial attempt. Additionally, one may pass in one or both of the following callbacks: isRetryable, a function returning true to continue retrying, false to stop. Defaults to true. The error that occurred is given as a parameter. For example, there is usually no reason to retry a 404 HTTP error, whereas a 500 or a timeout might work on the next attempt. delay, a function that returns the time in milliseconds to wait before retrying. Defaults to 0. The function is given a context object with the keys error (the error that occurred) and retriesDone (the number of retries already performed) to help determine the appropriate delay e.g. for an incremental backoff. var triggeringStream, ajaxCall // <- ajaxCall gives Errors on network or server errors ajaxResult = triggeringStream.flatMap(function(url) {     return Bacon.retry({         source: function() { return ajaxCall(url) },         retries: 5,         isRetryable: function (error) { return error.httpStatusCode !== 404; },         delay: function(context) { return 100; } // Just use the same delay always     }) }) Join Patterns Join patterns are a generalization of the zip function. While zip synchronizes events from multiple streams pairwse, join patterns allow for implementation of more advanced synchronization patterns. Bacon.js uses the Bacon.when function to convert a list of synchronization patterns into a resulting eventstream. Bacon.when Consider implementing a game with discrete time ticks. We want to handle key-events synchronized on tick-events, with at most one key event handled per tick. If there are no key events, we want to just process a tick.   Bacon.when(     [tick, keyEvent], function(_, k) { handleKeyEvent(k); return handleTick(); },     [tick], handleTick) Order is important here. If the [tick] patterns had been written first, this would have been tried first, and preferred at each tick. Join patterns are indeed a generalization of zip, and for EventStreams, zip is equivalent to a single-rule join pattern. The following observables have the same output, assuming that all sources are EventStreams. Bacon.zipWith(a,b,c, combine) Bacon.when([a,b,c], combine) Note that Bacon.when does not trigger updates for events from Properties though; if you use a Property in your pattern, its value will be just sampled when all the other sources (EventStreams) have a value. This is useful when you need a value of a Property in your calculations. If you want your pattern to fire for a Property too, you can convert it into an EventStream using property.changes() or property.toEventStream() Bacon.update creates a Property from an initial value and updates the value based on multiple inputs. The inputs are defined similarly to Bacon.when, like this: var result = Bacon.update(   initial,   [x,y,z], function(previous,x,y,z) { ... },   [x,y],   function(previous,x,y) { ... }) As input, each function above will get the previous value of the result Property, along with values from the listed Observables. The value returned by the function will be used as the next value of result. Just like in Bacon.when, only EventStreams will trigger an update, while Properties will be just sampled. So, if you list a single EventStream and several Properties, the value will be updated only when an event occurs in the EventStream. Here's a simple gaming example: var scoreMultiplier = Bacon.constant(1) var hitUfo = new Bacon.Bus() var hitMotherShip = new Bacon.Bus() var score = Bacon.update(   0,   [hitUfo, scoreMultiplier], function(score, _, multiplier) { return score + 100 * multiplier },   [hitMotherShip], function(score, _) { return score + 2000 } ) In the example, the score property is updated when either hitUfo or hitMotherShip occur. The scoreMultiplier Property is sampled to take multiplier into account when hitUfo occurs. Join patterns as a ""chemical machine"" A quick way to get some intuition for join patterns is to understand them through an analogy in terms of atoms and molecules. A join pattern can here be regarded as a recipe for a chemical reaction. Lets say we have observables oxygen, carbon and hydrogen, where an event in these spawns an 'atom' of that type into a mixture. We can state reactions make_water              = function(oxygen, hydrogen, hydrogen)  { /* ... consume oxygen and hydrogen ... */ } make_carbon_monoxide    = function(oxygen, carbon)              { /* ... consume oxygen and carbon ... */ }  Bacon.when(   [oxygen, hydrogen, hydrogen], make_water,   [oxygen, carbon],             make_carbon_monoxide, ) Now, every time a new 'atom' is spawned from one of the observables, this atom is added to the mixture. If at any time there are two hydrogen atoms, and an oxygen atom, the corresponding atoms are consumed, and output is produced via make_water. The same semantics apply for the second rule to create carbon monoxide. The rules are tried at each point from top to bottom. Join patterns and properties Properties are not part of the synchronization pattern, but are instead just sampled. The following example take three input streams $price, $quantity and $total, e.g. coming from input fields, and defines mutally recursive behaviours in properties price, quantity and total such that updating price sets total to price * quantity updating quantity sets total to price * quantity updating total sets price to total / quantity   var $price, $total, $quantity = ...    var quantity = $quantity.toProperty(1)    var price = Bacon.when(     [$price], id,     [$total, quantity], function(x,y) { return x/y })    .toProperty(0)    var total = Bacon.when(     [$total], id,     [$price, quantity], function(x,y) { return x*y },     [price, $quantity], function(x,y) { return x*y })    .toProperty(0)  Join patterns and Bacon.bus The result functions of join patterns are allowed to push values onto a Bus that may in turn be in one of its patterns. For instance, an implementation of the dining philosophers problem can be written as follows. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) Example: // availability of chopsticks are implemented using Bus var chopsticks = [new Bacon.Bus(), new Bacon.Bus(), new Bacon.Bus()]  // hungry could be any type of observable, but we'll use bus here var hungry     = [new Bacon.Bus(), new Bacon.Bus(), new Bacon.Bus()]  // a philosopher eats for one second, then makes the chopsticks // available again by pushing values onto their bus. var eat = function(i) {   return function() {     setTimeout(function() {       console.log('done!')       chopsticks[i].push({})       chopsticks[(i+1) % 3].push({})     }, 1000);     return 'philosopher ' + i + ' eating'   } }  // we use Bacon.when to make sure a hungry philosopher can eat only // when both his chopsticks are available. var dining = Bacon.when(   [hungry[0], chopsticks[0], chopsticks[1]],  eat(0),   [hungry[1], chopsticks[1], chopsticks[2]],  eat(1),   [hungry[2], chopsticks[2], chopsticks[0]],  eat(2))  dining.log()  // make all chopsticks initially available chopsticks[0].push({}); chopsticks[1].push({}); chopsticks[2].push({})  // make philosophers hungry in some way, in this case we just push to their bus for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {   hungry[0].push({}); hungry[1].push({}); hungry[2].push({}) } Cleaning up As described above, a subscriber can signal the loss of interest in new events in any of these two ways: Return Bacon.noMore from the handler function Call the dispose() function that was returned by the subscribe() call. Based on my experience on RxJs coding, an actual side-effect subscriber in application-code never does this. So the business of unsubscribing is mostly internal business and you can ignore it unless you're working on a custom stream implementation or a stream combinator. In that case, I welcome you to contribute your stuff to bacon.js. EventStream and Property semantics The state of an EventStream can be defined as (t, os) where t is time and os the list of current subscribers. This state should define the behavior of the stream in the sense that When a Next event is emitted, the same event is emitted to all subscribers After an event has been emitted, it will never be emitted again, even if a new subscriber is registered. A new event with the same value may of course be emitted later. When a new subscriber is registered, it will get exactly the same events as the other subscriber, after registration. This means that the stream cannot emit any ""initial"" events to the new subscriber, unless it emits them to all of its subscribers. A stream must never emit any other events after End (not even another End) The rules are deliberately redundant, explaining the constraints from different perspectives. The contract between an EventStream and its subscriber is as follows: For each new value, the subscriber function is called. The new value is wrapped into a Next event. The subscriber function returns a result which is either Bacon.noMore or Bacon.more. The undefined value is handled like Bacon.more. In case of Bacon.noMore the source must never call the subscriber again. When the stream ends, the subscriber function will be called with and Bacon.End event. The return value of the subscribe function is ignored in this case. A Property behaves similarly to an EventStream except that On a call to subscribe, it will deliver its current value (if any) to the provided subscriber function wrapped into an Initial event. This means that if the Property has previously emitted the value x to its subscribers and that is the latest value emitted, it will deliver this value to the new subscriber. Property may or may not have a current value to start with. Depends on how the Property was created. Atomic updates From version 0.4.0, Bacon.js supports atomic updates to properties, with known limitations. Assume you have properties A and B and property C = A + B. Assume that both A and B depend on D, so that when D changes, both A and B will change too. When D changes d1 -> d2, the value of A a1 -> a2 and B changes b1 -> b2 simultaneously, you'd like C to update atomically so that it would go directly a1+b1 -> a2+b2. And, in fact, it does exactly that. Prior to version 0.4.0, C would have an additional transitional state like a1+b1 -> a2+b1 -> a2+b2 Atomic updates are limited to Properties only, meaning that simultaneous events in EventStreams will not be recognized as simultaneous and may cause extra transitional states to Properties. But as long as you're just combining Properties, you'll updates will be atomic. For RxJs Users Bacon.js is quite similar to RxJs, so it should be pretty easy to pick up. The major difference is that in bacon, there are two distinct kinds of Observables: the EventStream and the Property. The former is for discrete events while the latter is for observable properties that have the concept of ""current value"". Also, there are no ""cold observables"", which means also that all EventStreams and Properties are consistent among subscribers: when as event occurs, all subscribers will observe the same event. If you're experienced with RxJs, you've probably bumped into some wtf's related to cold observables and inconsistent output from streams constructed using scan and startWith. None of that will happen with bacon.js. Error handling is also a bit different: the Error event does not terminate a stream. So, a stream may contain multiple errors. To me, this makes more sense than always terminating the stream on error; this way the application developer has more direct control over error handling. You can always use stream.endOnError() to get a stream that ends on error! Examples See Examples See Specs See Worzone demo and source Build First check out the Bacon.js repository and run npm install. Then build the coffeescript sources into javascript: ./build  Result javascript files will be generated in dist directory. If your planning to develop Bacon.js yourself, you'll want to run [tests] too. You can also build a bundle with selected features only. For instance ./build flatmap combine takeuntil  The build system will do its best to determine the dependencies of the selected features and include those into the bundle too. You can also test the integrity of the bundle with your selected features using ./test flatmap combine takeuntil  Test Run all unit tests: ./test  Run limited set of unit tests: ./test core _ frompromise  The names correspond to the file names under spec/specs. The library will be built with the listed features only. You can also test all features individually: ./test-individually.js  This will loop thru all files under spec/specs and build the library with the single feature and run the test. Run browser tests (using testem): npm install npm install -g testem testem  Run browser (without testem): npm install browsertest/browserify open browsertest/mocha.runner.html  Run performance tests: performance/PerformanceTest.coffee performance/PerformanceTest.coffee flatmap  Run memory usage tests: coffee --nodejs '--expose-gc' performance/MemoryTest.coffee  Dependencies Runtime: jQuery or Zepto.js (optional; just for jQ/Zepto bindings) Build/test: node.js, npm, coffeescript Compatibility with other libs Bacon.js doesn't mess with prototypes or the global object. Only exceptions below. It exports the Bacon object, except in Node.js. In a browser, this is added to the window object. If jQuery is defined, it adds the asEventStream method to jQuery (similarly to Zepto) So, it should be pretty much compatible and a nice citizen. I'm not sure how it works in case some other lib adds stuff to, say, Array prototype, though. Maybe add test for this later? Compatibility with browsers TLDR: good. Bacon.js is not browser dependent, because it is not a UI library. I have personally used it Bacon.js with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE 6+, iPhone, iPad. Automatically tested on each commit on modern browsers. Node.js Sure. Works. Try it out. npm install baconjs  Then type node and try the following Bacon = require(""baconjs"").Bacon Bacon.sequentially(1000, [""B"", ""A"", ""C"", ""O"", ""N""]).log() AMD Yep. Currently exports Bacon through AMD and assigns to window for backwards compatibility. If you would like to use it with jQuery and AMD, you should monkey patch jQuery explicitly so that module loading order does not matter define(function (require) {     var $ = require('jquery'),         Bacon = require('Bacon');      $.fn.asEventStream = Bacon.$.asEventStream;      $(document).asEventStream('click').onValue(function (e) {         console.log(e.clientX + ', ' + e.clientY);     }); }); Why Bacon? Bacon.js exists largely because I got frustrated with RxJs, which is a good library, but at that time didn't have very good documentation and wasn't open-source. Things have improved a lot in the Rx world since that. Yet, there are still compelling reasons to use Bacon.js instead. Like, for instance, more consistent stream/property behavior and (arguably) simplicity of use. Contribute Use GitHub issues and Pull Requests. Note: this readme is generated from readme-src.coffee.

View the Highland website for more in-depth documentation. Introduction Re-thinking the JavaScript utility belt, Highland manages synchronous and asynchronous code easily, using nothing more than standard JavaScript and Node-like Streams. You may be familiar with Promises, EventEmitters and callbacks, but moving between them is far from seamless. Thankfully, there exists a deeper abstraction which can free our code. By updating the tools we use on Arrays, and applying them to values distributed in time instead of space, we can discard plumbing and focus on the important things. With Highland, you can switch between synchronous and asynchronous data sources at will, without having to re-write your code. Time to dive in! Made by @caolan, with help and patience from friends - Leave a tip or fork this :) Examples Usage as a Node.js module var _ = require('highland'); Converting to/from Highland Streams _([1,2,3,4]).toArray(function (xs) {     // xs is [1,2,3,4] }); Mapping over a Stream var doubled = _([1,2,3,4]).map(function (x) {     return x * 2; }); Reading files in parallel (4 at once) var data = _(filenames).map(readFile).parallel(4); Handling errors data.errors(function (err, rethrow) {     // handle or rethrow error }); Piping to a Node Stream data.pipe(output); Piping in data from Node Streams var output = fs.createWriteStream('output'); var docs = db.createReadStream();  // wrap a node stream and pipe to file _(docs).filter(isBlogpost).pipe(output);  // or, pipe in a node stream directly: var through = _.pipeline(_.filter(isBlogpost)); docs.pipe(through).pipe(output); Handling events var clicks = _('click', btn).map(1); var counter = clicks.scan(0, _.add);  counter.each(function (n) {     $('#count').text(n); }); Learn more at highlandjs.org Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

It helps you compose asynchronous operations on streams of values and events, e.g. WebSocket messages, DOM events, etc, and on time-varying values, e.g. the ""current value"" of an <input>, without many of the hazards of side effects and mutable shared state. It features an ultra-high performance, low overhead architecture, APIs for easily creating event streams from existing sources, like DOM events, and a small but powerful set of operations for merging, filtering, transforming, and reducing event streams and time-varying values. Learn more API docs Recipes Examples Get it Simple example Here's a simple program that displays the result of adding two inputs. The result is reactive and updates whenever either input changes. First, the HTML fragment for the inputs and a place to display the live result: <form>     <input class=""x""> + <input class=""y""> = <span class=""result""></span> </form> Using most.js to make it reactive: import { fromEvent, combine } from 'most'  const xInput = document.querySelector('input.x') const yInput = document.querySelector('input.y') const resultNode = document.querySelector('.result')  const add = (x, y) => x + y  const toNumber = e => Number(e.target.value)  const renderResult = result => {     resultNode.textContent = result }  export const main = () => {     // x represents the current value of xInput     const x = fromEvent('input', xInput).map(toNumber)      // y represents the current value of yInput     const y = fromEvent('input', yInput).map(toNumber)      // result is the live current value of adding x and y     const result = combine(add, x, y)      // Observe the result value by rendering it to the resultNode     result.observe(renderResult) } More examples You can find the example above and others in the Examples repo. Get it Requirements Most requires ES6 Promise. You can use your favorite polyfill, such as creed, when, bluebird, es6-promise, etc. Using a polyfill can be especially beneficial on platforms that don't yet have good unhandled rejection reporting capabilities. Install As a module: npm install --save most  // ES6 import { /* functions */ } from 'most' // or import * as most from 'most' // ES5 var most = require('most') As window.most: bower install --save most`  <script src=""most/dist/most.js""></script> Typescript support Most.js works with typescript out of the box as it provides local typings that will be read when you import Most.js in your code. You do not need to manually link an external d.ts file in your tsconfig. Most.js has a dependency on native Promises so a type definition for Promise must be available in your setup: If your tsconfig is targeting ES6, you do not need to do anything as typescript will include a definition for Promise by default. If your tsconfig is targeting ES5, you need to provide your own Promise definition. For instance es6shim.d.ts Interoperability Most.js streams are compatible with Promises/A+ and ES6 Promises. They also implement Fantasy Land Monoid, Functor, Applicative, and Monad. Reactive Programming Reactive programming is an important concept that provides a lot of advantages: it naturally handles asynchrony and provides a model for dealing with complex data and time flow while also lessening the need to resort to shared mutable state. It has many applications: interactive UIs and animation, client-server communication, robotics, IoT, sensor networks, etc. Why most.js for Reactive Programming? High performance A primary focus of most.js is performance. The perf test results indicate that it is achieving its goals in this area. Our hope is that by publishing those numbers, and showing what is possible, other libs will improve as well. Modular architecture Most.js is highly modularized. It's internal Stream/Source/Sink architecture and APIs are simple, concise, and well defined. Combinators are implemented entirely in terms of that API, and don't need to use any private details. This makes it easy to implement new combinators externally (ie in contrib repos, for example) while also guaranteeing they can still be high performance. Simplicity Aside from making combinators less ""obviously correct"", complexity can also lead to performace and maintainability issues. We felt a simple implementation would lead to a more stable and performant lib overall. Integration Most.js integrates with language features, such as promises, iterators, generators, and asynchronous generators. Promises Promises are a natural compliment to asynchronous reactive streams. The relationship between synchronous ""sequence"" and ""value"" is clear, and the asynchronous analogue needs to be clear, too. By taking the notion of a sequence and a value and lifting them into the asynchronous world, it seems clear that reducing an asynchronous sequence should produce a promise. Hence, most.js uses promises when a single value is the natural synchronous analogue. Most.js interoperates seamlessly with ES6 and Promises/A+ promises. For example, reducing a stream returns a promise for the final result: import { from } from 'most' // After 1 second, logs 10 from([1, 2, 3, 4])     .delay(1000)     .reduce((result, y) => result + y, 0)     .then(result => console.log(result)) You can also create a stream from a promise: import { fromPromise } from 'most' // Logs ""hello"" fromPromise(Promise.resolve('hello'))     .observe(message => console.log(message)) Generators Conceptually, generators allow you to write a function that acts like an iterable sequence. Generators support the standard ES6 Iterator interface, so they can be iterated over using ES6 standard for of or the iterator's next() API. Most.js interoperates with ES6 generators and iterators. For example, you can create an event stream from any ES6 iterable: import { from } from 'most'  function* allTheIntegers() {     let i=0     while(true) {         yield i++     } }  // Log the first 100 integers from(allTheIntegers())     .take(100)     .observe(x => console.log(x)) Asynchronous Generators You can also create an event stream from an asynchronous generator, a generator that yields promises: import { generate } from 'most'  function* allTheIntegers(interval) {     let i=0     while(true) {         yield delayPromise(interval, i++)     } }  const delayPromise = (ms, value) =>     new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(value), ms))  // Log the first 100 integers, at 1 second intervals generate(allTheIntegers, 1000)     .take(100)     .observe(x => console.log(x)) Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Screencast: intro to MobX State Management Is Easy, React Amsterdam 2016 conf (slides) Transparent Reactive Programming and Mutable Data, Reactive2015 conf (slides) More tutorials, blogs and videos can be found on the MobX homepage Boilerplates and related projects Introduction MobX is a battle tested library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP). The philosophy behind MobX is very simple: Anything that can be derived from the application state, should be derived. Automatically. which includes the UI, data serialization, server communication, etc. React and MobX together are a powerful combination. React renders the application state by providing mechanisms to translate it into a tree of renderable components. MobX provides the mechanism to store and update the application state that React then uses. Both React and MobX provide very optimal and unique solutions to common problems in application development. React provides mechanisms to optimally render UI by using a virtual DOM that reduces the number of costly DOM mutations. MobX provides mechanisms to optimally synchronize application state with your React components by using a reactive virtual dependency state graph that is only updated when strictly needed and is never stale. Core concepts MobX has only a few core concepts. The following snippets can be tried online using JSFiddle (or without ES6 and JSX). Observable state MobX adds observable capabilities to existing data structures like objects, arrays and class instances. This can simply be done by annotating your class properties with the @observable decorator (ES.Next), or by invoking the observable or extendObservable functions (ES5). See Language support for language-specific examples. // ESNext class example:  class Todo {     id = Math.random();     @observable title = """";     @observable finished = false; }  // ES5 constructor function example: function Todo() {     this.id = Math.random()     extendObservable(this, {         title: """",         finished: false     }) }  // ... or just create plain objects: function createTodo() {     return observable({         id: Math.random(),         title: """",         finished: false     }) }  Using @observable is like turning a value into a spreadsheet cell. But unlike spreadsheets, not only can these values be primitive values, but references, objects and arrays as well. You can even define your own observable data sources. Computed values With MobX you can define values that will be derived automatically when relevant data is modified. By using the @computed decorator or by using parameterless functions as property values in extendObservable. // ESNext class example:  class TodoList {     @observable todos = [];     @computed get unfinishedTodoCount() {         return this.todos.filter(todo => !todo.finished).length;     } }  // ES5 constructor function example: function TodoList() {     extendObservable(this, {         todos: [],         unfinishedTodoCount: function() {             return this.todos.filter(function (todo) {                 return !todo.finished             }).length;         }     }) } MobX will ensure that unfinishedTodoCount is updated automatically when a todo is added or when one of the finished properties is modified. Computations like these can very well be compared with formulas in spreadsheet programs like MS Excel. They update automatically whenever, and only when, needed. Reactions Reactions are similar to a computed value, but instead of producing a new value, a reaction produces a side effect for things like printing to the console, making network requests, incrementally updating the React component tree to patch the DOM, etc. In short, reactions bridge reactive and imperative programming. If you are using React, you can turn your (stateless function) components into reactive components by simply adding the @observer decorator from the mobx-react package onto them. import React, {Component} from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import {observer} from ""mobx-react"";  // ESNext decorator / JSX @observer class TodoListView extends Component {     render() {         return <div>             <ul>                 {this.props.todoList.todos.map(todo =>                     <TodoView todo={todo} key={todo.id} />                 )}             </ul>             Tasks left: {this.props.todoList.unfinishedTodoCount}         </div>     } }  const TodoView = observer(({todo}) =>     <li>         <input             type=""checkbox""             checked={todo.finished}             onClick={() => todo.finished = !todo.finished}         />{todo.title}     </li> );  const store = new TodoList(); ReactDOM.render(<TodoListView todoList={store} />, document.getElementById('mount')); In ES5 a component declaration looks like this: var TodoListView = observer(React.createClass({ /* etc */ })) observer turns React (function) components into derivations of the data they render. Also, reactions can be created using the autorun, autorunAsync or when functions to fit your specific situations. When using MobX there are no smart or dumb components. All components render smartly but are defined in a dumb manner. MobX will simply make sure the components are always re-rendered whenever needed, but also no more than that. So the onClick handler in the above example will force the proper TodoView to render, and it will cause the TodoListView to render if the number of unfinished tasks has changed. However, if you would remove the Tasks left line (or put it into a separate component), the TodoListView will no longer re-render when ticking a box. You can verify this yourself by changing the JSFiddle. Actions Unlike many flux frameworks, MobX is unopinionated about how user events should be handled. This can be done in a Flux like manner. Or by processing events using RxJS. Or by simply handling events in the most straightforward way possible, as demonstrated in the above onClick handler. In the end it all boils down to: Somehow the state should be updated. After updating the state MobX will take care of the rest in an efficient, glitch-free manner. So simple statements, like below, are enough to automatically update the user interface. There is no technical need for firing events, calling dispatcher or what more. A React component is in the end nothing more than a fancy representation of your state. A derivation that will be managed by MobX. store.todos.push(     new Todo(""Get Coffee""),     new Todo(""Write simpler code"") ); store.todos[0].finished = true; Nonetheless, MobX has an optional built-in concept of actions. Use them to your advantage; they will help you to structure your code better and make wise decisions about when and where state should be modified. MobX: Simple and scalable MobX is one of the least obtrusive libraries you can use for state management. That makes the MobX approach not just simple, but very scalable as well: Using classes and real references With MobX you don't need to normalize your data. This makes the library very suitable for very complex domain models (At Mendix for example ~500 different domain classes in a single application). Referential integrity is guaranteed Since data doesn't need to be normalized, and MobX automatically tracks the relations between state and derivations, you get referential integrity for free. Rendering something that is accessed through three levels of indirection? No problem, MobX will track them and re-render whenever one of the references changes. As a result staleness bugs are a thing of the past. As a programmer you might forget that changing some data might influence a seemingly unrelated component in a corner case. MobX won't forget. Simpler actions are easier to maintain As demonstrated above, modifying state when using MobX is very straightforward. You simply write down your intentions. MobX will take care of the rest. Fine grained observability is efficient MobX builds a graph of all the derivations in your application to find the least number of re-computations that is needed to prevent staleness. ""Derive everything"" might sound expensive, MobX builds a virtual derivation graph to minimize the number of recomputations needed to keep derivations in sync with the state. In fact, when testing MobX at Mendix we found out that using this library to track the relations in our code is often a lot more efficient then pushing changes through our application by using handwritten events or ""smart"" selector based container components. The simple reason is that MobX will establish far more fine grained 'listeners' on your data then you would do as a programmer. Secondly MobX sees the causality between derivations so it can order them in such a way that no derivation has to run twice or introduces a glitch. How that works? See this in-depth explanation of MobX. Easy interoperability MobX works plain javascript structures. Due to it's unobtrusiveness it works with most javascript libraries out of the box, without needing MobX specific library flavors. So you can simple keep using your existing router-, data fetching and utility libraries like react-router, director, superagent, lodash etc. For the same reason you can use it out of the box both server- and client side, in isomorphic applications and with react-native. The result of this is that you often need to learn less new concepts when using MobX in comparison to other state management solutions. MobX is proudly used in mission critical systems at Mendix Credits MobX is inspired by reactive programming principles as found in spreadsheets. It is inspired by MVVM frameworks like in MeteorJS tracker, knockout and Vue.js. But MobX brings Transparent Functional Reactive Programming to the next level and provides a stand alone implementation. It implements TFRP in a glitch-free, synchronous, predictable and efficient manner. A ton of credits for Mendix, for providing the flexibility and support to maintain MobX and the chance to proof the philosophy of MobX in a real, complex, performance critical applications. And finally kudo's for all the people that believed in, tried and validated MobX.

I love it! ‐ Johan den Haan, CTO of Mendix We ported the book Notes and Kanban examples to MobX. Check out the source to see how this worked out. Compared to the original I was definitely positively surprised. MobX seems like a good fit for these problems. ‐ Juho Vepsäläinen, author of ""SurviveJS - Webpack and React"" and jster.net curator Great job with MobX! Really gives current conventions and libraries a run for their money. ‐ Daniel Dunderfelt I was reluctant to abandon immutable data and the PureRenderMixin, but I no longer have any reservations. I can't think of any reason not to do things the simple, elegant way you have demonstrated. ‐David Schalk, fpcomplete.com Contributing Feel free to send small pull requests.

Persistent data presents a mutative API which does not update the data in-place, but instead always yields new updated data. Immutable.js provides many Persistent Immutable data structures including: List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record. These data structures are highly efficient on modern JavaScript VMs by using structural sharing via hash maps tries and vector tries as popularized by Clojure and Scala, minimizing the need to copy or cache data. Immutable also provides a lazy Seq, allowing efficient chaining of collection methods like map and filter without creating intermediate representations. Create some Seq with Range and Repeat. Want to hear more? Watch the presentation about Immutable.js: Getting started Install immutable using npm. npm install immutable Then require it into any module. var Immutable = require('immutable'); var map1 = Immutable.Map({a:1, b:2, c:3}); var map2 = map1.set('b', 50); map1.get('b'); // 2 map2.get('b'); // 50 Browser To use immutable from a browser, download dist/immutable.min.js or use a CDN such as CDNJS or jsDelivr. Then, add it as a script tag to your page: <script src=""immutable.min.js""></script> <script>     var map1 = Immutable.Map({a:1, b:2, c:3});     var map2 = map1.set('b', 50);     map1.get('b'); // 2     map2.get('b'); // 50 </script> Or use an AMD loader (such as RequireJS): require(['./immutable.min.js'], function (Immutable) {     var map1 = Immutable.Map({a:1, b:2, c:3});     var map2 = map1.set('b', 50);     map1.get('b'); // 2     map2.get('b'); // 50 }); If you're using browserify, the immutable npm module also works from the browser. TypeScript Use these Immutable collections and sequences as you would use native collections in your TypeScript programs while still taking advantage of type generics, error detection, and auto-complete in your IDE. Just add a reference with a relative path to the type declarations at the top of your file. ///<reference path='./node_modules/immutable/dist/immutable.d.ts'/> import Immutable = require('immutable'); var map1: Immutable.Map<string, number>; map1 = Immutable.Map({a:1, b:2, c:3}); var map2 = map1.set('b', 50); map1.get('b'); // 2 map2.get('b'); // 50 The case for Immutability Much of what makes application development difficult is tracking mutation and maintaining state. Developing with immutable data encourages you to think differently about how data flows through your application. Subscribing to data events throughout your application creates a huge overhead of book-keeping which can hurt performance, sometimes dramatically, and creates opportunities for areas of your application to get out of sync with each other due to easy to make programmer error. Since immutable data never changes, subscribing to changes throughout the model is a dead-end and new data can only ever be passed from above. This model of data flow aligns well with the architecture of React and especially well with an application designed using the ideas of Flux. When data is passed from above rather than being subscribed to, and you're only interested in doing work when something has changed, you can use equality. Immutable collections should be treated as values rather than objects. While objects represents some thing which could change over time, a value represents the state of that thing at a particular instance of time. This principle is most important to understanding the appropriate use of immutable data. In order to treat Immutable.js collections as values, it's important to use the Immutable.is() function or .equals() method to determine value equality instead of the === operator which determines object reference identity. var map1 = Immutable.Map({a:1, b:2, c:3}); var map2 = map1.set('b', 2); assert(map1.equals(map2) === true); var map3 = map1.set('b', 50); assert(map1.equals(map3) === false); Note: As a performance optimization Immutable attempts to return the existing collection when an operation would result in an identical collection, allowing for using === reference equality to determine if something definitely has not changed. This can be extremely useful when used within memoization function which would prefer to re-run the function if a deeper equality check could potentially be more costly. The === equality check is also used internally by Immutable.is and .equals() as a performance optimization. If an object is immutable, it can be ""copied"" simply by making another reference to it instead of copying the entire object. Because a reference is much smaller than the object itself, this results in memory savings and a potential boost in execution speed for programs which rely on copies (such as an undo-stack). var map1 = Immutable.Map({a:1, b:2, c:3}); var clone = map1; JavaScript-first API While immutable is inspired by Clojure, Scala, Haskell and other functional programming environments, it's designed to bring these powerful concepts to JavaScript, and therefore has an Object-Oriented API that closely mirrors that of ES6 Array, Map, and Set. The difference for the immutable collections is that methods which would mutate the collection, like push, set, unshift or splice instead return a new immutable collection. Methods which return new arrays like slice or concat instead return new immutable collections. var list1 = Immutable.List.of(1, 2); var list2 = list1.push(3, 4, 5); var list3 = list2.unshift(0); var list4 = list1.concat(list2, list3); assert(list1.size === 2); assert(list2.size === 5); assert(list3.size === 6); assert(list4.size === 13); assert(list4.get(0) === 1); Almost all of the methods on Array will be found in similar form on Immutable.List, those of Map found on Immutable.Map, and those of Set found on Immutable.Set, including collection operations like forEach() and map(). var alpha = Immutable.Map({a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}); alpha.map((v, k) => k.toUpperCase()).join(); // 'A,B,C,D' Accepts raw JavaScript objects. Designed to inter-operate with your existing JavaScript, immutable accepts plain JavaScript Arrays and Objects anywhere a method expects an Iterable with no performance penalty. var map1 = Immutable.Map({a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}); var map2 = Immutable.Map({c:10, a:20, t:30}); var obj = {d:100, o:200, g:300}; var map3 = map1.merge(map2, obj); // Map { a: 20, b: 2, c: 10, d: 100, t: 30, o: 200, g: 300 } This is possible because immutable can treat any JavaScript Array or Object as an Iterable. You can take advantage of this in order to get sophisticated collection methods on JavaScript Objects, which otherwise have a very sparse native API. Because Seq evaluates lazily and does not cache intermediate results, these operations can be extremely efficient. var myObject = {a:1,b:2,c:3}; Immutable.Seq(myObject).map(x => x * x).toObject(); // { a: 1, b: 4, c: 9 } Keep in mind, when using JS objects to construct Immutable Maps, that JavaScript Object properties are always strings, even if written in a quote-less shorthand, while Immutable Maps accept keys of any type. var obj = { 1: ""one"" }; Object.keys(obj); // [ ""1"" ] obj[""1""]; // ""one"" obj[1];   // ""one""  var map = Immutable.fromJS(obj); map.get(""1""); // ""one"" map.get(1);   // undefined Property access for JavaScript Objects first converts the key to a string, but since Immutable Map keys can be of any type the argument to get() is not altered. Converts back to raw JavaScript objects. All immutable Iterables can be converted to plain JavaScript Arrays and Objects shallowly with toArray() and toObject() or deeply with toJS(). All Immutable Iterables also implement toJSON() allowing them to be passed to JSON.stringify directly. var deep = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: Immutable.List.of(3, 4, 5) }); deep.toObject() // { a: 1, b: 2, c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ] } deep.toArray() // [ 1, 2, List [ 3, 4, 5 ] ] deep.toJS() // { a: 1, b: 2, c: [ 3, 4, 5 ] } JSON.stringify(deep) // '{""a"":1,""b"":2,""c"":[3,4,5]}' Embraces ES6 Immutable takes advantage of features added to JavaScript in ES6, the latest standard version of ECMAScript (JavaScript), including Iterators, Arrow Functions, Classes, and Modules. It's also inspired by the Map and Set collections added to ES6. The library is ""transpiled"" to ES3 in order to support all modern browsers. All examples are presented in ES6. To run in all browsers, they need to be translated to ES3. // ES6 foo.map(x => x * x); // ES3 foo.map(function (x) { return x * x; }); Nested Structures The collections in immutable are intended to be nested, allowing for deep trees of data, similar to JSON. var nested = Immutable.fromJS({a:{b:{c:[3,4,5]}}}); // Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ] } } } A few power-tools allow for reading and operating on nested data. The most useful are mergeDeep, getIn, setIn, and updateIn, found on List, Map and OrderedMap. var nested2 = nested.mergeDeep({a:{b:{d:6}}}); // Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ], d: 6 } } } nested2.getIn(['a', 'b', 'd']); // 6  var nested3 = nested2.updateIn(['a', 'b', 'd'], value => value + 1); // Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ], d: 7 } } }  var nested4 = nested3.updateIn(['a', 'b', 'c'], list => list.push(6)); // Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5, 6 ], d: 7 } } } Lazy Seq Seq describes a lazy operation, allowing them to efficiently chain use of all the Iterable methods (such as map and filter). Seq is immutable — Once a Seq is created, it cannot be changed, appended to, rearranged or otherwise modified. Instead, any mutative method called on a Seq will return a new Seq. Seq is lazy — Seq does as little work as necessary to respond to any method call. For example, the following does not perform any work, because the resulting Seq is never used: var oddSquares = Immutable.Seq.of(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)   .filter(x => x % 2).map(x => x * x);  Once the Seq is used, it performs only the work necessary. In this example, no intermediate arrays are ever created, filter is called three times, and map is only called twice: console.log(oddSquares.get(1)); // 9  Any collection can be converted to a lazy Seq with .toSeq(). var seq = Immutable.Map({a:1, b:1, c:1}).toSeq();  Seq allow for the efficient chaining of sequence operations, especially when converting to a different concrete type (such as to a JS object): seq.flip().map(key => key.toUpperCase()).flip().toObject(); // Map { A: 1, B: 1, C: 1 }  As well as expressing logic that would otherwise seem memory-limited: Immutable.Range(1, Infinity)   .skip(1000)   .map(n => -n)   .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)   .take(2)   .reduce((r, n) => r * n, 1); // 1006008  Note: An iterable is always iterated in the same order, however that order may not always be well defined, as is the case for the Map. Equality treats Collections as Data Immutable provides equality which treats immutable data structures as pure data, performing a deep equality check if necessary. var map1 = Immutable.Map({a:1, b:1, c:1}); var map2 = Immutable.Map({a:1, b:1, c:1}); assert(map1 !== map2); // two different instances assert(Immutable.is(map1, map2)); // have equivalent values assert(map1.equals(map2)); // alternatively use the equals method Immutable.is() uses the same measure of equality as Object.is including if both are immutable and all keys and values are equal using the same measure of equality. Batching Mutations If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound? If a pure function mutates some local data in order to produce an immutable return value, is that ok? — Rich Hickey, Clojure Applying a mutation to create a new immutable object results in some overhead, which can add up to a minor performance penalty. If you need to apply a series of mutations locally before returning, Immutable gives you the ability to create a temporary mutable (transient) copy of a collection and apply a batch of mutations in a performant manner by using withMutations. In fact, this is exactly how Immutable applies complex mutations itself. As an example, building list2 results in the creation of 1, not 3, new immutable Lists. var list1 = Immutable.List.of(1,2,3); var list2 = list1.withMutations(function (list) {   list.push(4).push(5).push(6); }); assert(list1.size === 3); assert(list2.size === 6); Note: immutable also provides asMutable and asImmutable, but only encourages their use when withMutations will not suffice. Use caution to not return a mutable copy, which could result in undesired behavior. Important!: Only a select few methods can be used in withMutations including set, push and pop. These methods can be applied directly against a persistent data-structure where other methods like map, filter, sort, and splice will always return new immutable data-structures and never mutate a mutable collection.

Pull requests welcome. Breaking changes in 0.3.0 The API now uses idiomatic JavaScript naming conventions. Improvements to 0.3.0 Faster Mori is considerably faster across the board thanks to recent enhancements to the ClojureScript compiler. For users who would like to benchmark their immutable data structure implementations against Mori, Mori now exposes direct arity invokes which eliminates previous calling overheads from arity dispatching. See Benchmarking for more information. Mori hash maps now default to ClojureScript ArrayMaps that are automatically promoted to PersistentHashMaps as needed. ArrayMaps deliver considerably better performance at small sizes and when simple keys are at play. For example a Mori hash map with less than or equal to eight keys can now be built nearly an order of magnitude faster than Immutable.js 3.6.2 Maps. More ES6 All Mori collections support ES6 iteration via foo[Symbol.iterator] or foo[""@@iterator""]. Differences from Immutable.js A functional API, data structures do not have public methods Faster, ClojureScript data structures have been subjected to more real world usage and continuous benchmarking for nearly 4 years Larger, gzipped the base Mori module is about 6K larger than Immutable.js Getting it You can install the latest release via npm: npm install mori The installed package contains a single optimized JavaScript file mori.js. Load mori in your Node.js programs as you would any other module: var mori = require(""mori""); In a browser, you can load mori with a script tag, as you would any other JavaScript library: <script src=""mori.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script> You can also load it as an AMD module, e.g. with RequireJS. Usage You can use it from your projects like so: var inc = function(n) {   return n+1; };  mori.intoArray(mori.map(inc, mori.vector(1,2,3,4,5))); // => [2,3,4,5,6] Efficient non-destructive updates! var v1 = mori.vector(1,2,3); var v2 = mori.conj(v1, 4); v1.toString(); // => '[1 2 3]' v2.toString(); // => '[1 2 3 4]' var sum = function(a, b) {   return a + b; }; mori.reduce(sum, mori.vector(1, 2, 3, 4)); // => 10 Lazy sequences! var _ = mori; _.intoArray(_.interpose(""foo"", _.vector(1, 2, 3, 4))); // => [1, ""foo"", 2, ""foo"", 3, ""foo"", 4] Or if it's more your speed, use it from CoffeeScript! inc = (x) -> x+1   r = mori.map inc, mori.vector(1,2,3,4,5) mori.intoArray r Documentation You can find extensive documentation and examples here. More Examples Efficient Freeze/Thaw For vectors and maps we provide an efficient thaw and freeze operations: var m = mori;  // ~220ms with V8 version 3.29.80 MBP 2.26ghz for(var j = 0; j < 10; j++) {   var s = new Date();   var arr = [];   for(var i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {     arr.push(i);   }   print(""Array push "" + arr.length + "" items "" + ((new Date())-s));   gc(); }  // ~70ms for(var j = 0; j < 10; j++) {   s = new Date();   var mv = m._thaw(m.vector());   for(var i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {     mv = m._conj.f2(mv, i);   }   var v = m._freeze(mv);   print(""Mutable vector conj "" + m.count(v) + "" items "" + ((new Date())-s));   gc(); } ES6 Map/Set inspired interfaces All Mori maps and sets support all the non-mutating methods of the proposed ES6 Map and Set interfaces. The main difference with the spec is that key lookup is based on value not reference. keys, values, and entries methods return the proposed mutable iterators: var m = mori; var h = m.hashMap(""foo"", 1, ""bar"", 2);  h.has(""foo""); // => true h.get(""foo""); // => 1  var iter = h.keys(); iter.next(); // => {done: false, value: ""foo""} This feature is subject to changes in the ES6 proposal. Transducers Mori includes Transducers. Zero allocation collection operations FTW: var m = mori; var a = [];  for(var i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {   a.push(i); }  // make it immutable var v = m.into(m.vector(), a);  function time(f) {   var s = new Date();   f();   console.log(((new Date())-s)+""ms""); }  // ~190ms V8 version 3.29.80 MBP 2.26ghz time(function() {   var xf = m.comp(m.map(m.inc), m.map(m.inc), m.map(m.inc));   return m.transduce(xf, m.completing(m.sum), 0, v); }, 10);  // ~440ms time(function() {   return a.map(m.inc).map(m.inc).map(m.inc).reduce(function(a,b){return a+b;}, 0); }, 10); Build Prerequisites You will first need to install the Java SDK, if it's not already installed on your system. On Windows, you will need to manually install Leiningen. On UNIX-like systems, Leiningen will be installed within the project automatically if the lein executable is not found on your path or if your lein version predates 2.0.0. Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/swannodette/mori.git cd mori On a UNIX-like system build with ./scripts/build.sh Alternatively using npm npm run-script build On Windows ./scripts/build.ps1 The build process will generate an optimized JavaScript file mori.js, which is suitable for use with Node.js, or in a Web browser or other JavaScript environments. You can also load it as an AMD module. Copyright (C) 2012-2015 David Nolen and contributors Distributed under the Eclipse Public License, the same as Clojure.

If you like risk, you can download the latest master version, it's usually stable. To run the tests: $ npm test  Description This project provides a HashMap class that works both on Node.js and the browser. HashMap instances store key/value pairs allowing keys of any type. Unlike regular objects, keys will not be stringified. For example numbers and strings won't be mixed, you can pass Date's, RegExp's, DOM Elements, anything! (even null and undefined) HashMap constructor overloads new HashMap() creates an empty hashmap new HashMap(map:HashMap) creates a hashmap with the key-value pairs of map new HashMap(key:*, value:*, key2:*, value2:*, ...) creates a hashmap with several key-value pairs HashMap methods get(key:*) : * returns the value stored for that key. set(key:*, value:*) : HashMap stores a key-value pair multi(key:*, value:*, key2:*, value2:*, ...) : HashMap stores several key-value pairs copy(other:HashMap) : HashMap copies all key-value pairs from other to this instance has(key:*) : Boolean returns whether a key is set on the hashmap search(value:*) : * returns key under which given value is stored (null if not found) remove(key:*) : HashMap deletes a key-value pair by key type(key:*) : String returns the data type of the provided key (used internally) keys() : Array<*> returns an array with all the registered keys values() : Array<*> returns an array with all the values count() : Number returns the amount of key-value pairs clear() : HashMap removes all the key-value pairs on the hashmap clone() : HashMap creates a new hashmap with all the key-value pairs of the original hash(key:*) : String returns the stringified version of a key (used internally) forEach(function(value, key)) : HashMap iterates the pairs and calls the function for each one Method chaining All methods that don't return something, will return the HashMap instance to enable chaining. Examples Assume this for all examples below var map = new HashMap(); If you're using this within Node, you first need to import the class var HashMap = require('hashmap'); Basic use case map.set(""some_key"", ""some value""); map.get(""some_key""); // --> ""some value"" No stringification map.set(""1"", ""string one""); map.set(1, ""number one""); map.get(""1""); // --> ""string one"" A regular Object used as a map would yield ""number one"" Objects as keys var key = {}; var key2 = {}; map.set(key, 123); map.set(key2, 321); map.get(key); // --> 123 A regular Object used as a map would yield 321 Iterating map.set(1, ""test 1""); map.set(2, ""test 2""); map.set(3, ""test 3"");  map.forEach(function(value, key) {     console.log(key + "" : "" + value); }); Method chaining map   .set(1, ""test 1"")   .set(2, ""test 2"")   .set(3, ""test 3"")   .forEach(function(value, key) {       console.log(key + "" : "" + value);   }); LICENSE The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2012 Ariel Flesler Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the ""Software""), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Documentation Port to ECMAScript 6 (version 2.10.0) Moment 2.10.0 does not bring any new features, but the code is now written in ECMAScript 6 modules and placed inside src/. Previously moment.js, locale/*.js and test/moment/*.js, test/locale/*.js contained the source of the project. Now the source is in src/, temporary build (ECMAScript 5) files are placed under build/umd/ (for running tests during development), and the moment.js and locale/*.js files are updated only on release. If you want to use a particular revision of the code, make sure to run grunt transpile update-index, so moment.js and locales/*.js are synced with src/*. We might place that in a commit hook in the future. Upgrading to 2.0.0 There are a number of small backwards incompatible changes with version 2.0.0. See the full descriptions here Changed language ordinal method to return the number + ordinal instead of just the ordinal. Changed two digit year parsing cutoff to match strptime. Removed moment#sod and moment#eod in favor of moment#startOf and moment#endOf. Removed moment.humanizeDuration() in favor of moment.duration().humanize(). Removed the lang data objects from the top level namespace. Duplicate Date passed to moment() instead of referencing it. Changelog Contributing We're looking for co-maintainers!

How You Can Help If you like this project, buy me a coffee, or book a session with me, or donate bitcoin: 1rmm5tv6f997JK5bLcGbRCZyVjZUPkQ2m Usage First, load jQuery and the plugin: <script src=""jquery.min.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script> <script src=""jquery.timeago.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script> Now, let's attach it to your timestamps on DOM ready - put this in the head section: <script type=""text/javascript"">    jQuery(document).ready(function() {      $(""time.timeago"").timeago();    }); </script> This will turn all <time> elements with a class of timeago and a datetime attribute formatted according to the ISO 8601 standard: <time class=""timeago"" datetime=""2011-12-17T09:24:17Z"">December 17, 2011</time> into something like this: <time class=""timeago"" datetime=""2011-12-17T09:24:17Z"" title=""December 17, 2011"">about 1 day ago</time> <abbr> elements are also supported (this is for legacy microformat support and was originally supported by the library before the time element was introduced to HTML5): <abbr class=""timeago"" title=""2011-12-17T09:24:17Z"">December 17, 2011</abbr> As time passes, the timestamps will automatically update. If you want to update a timestamp programatically later, call the update function with a new ISO8601 timestamp of Date object. For example: $(""time#some_id"").timeago(""update"", ""2013-12-17T09:24:17Z""); // or $(""time#some_id"").timeago(""update"", new Date()); For more usage and examples: http://timeago.yarp.com/ For different language configurations: visit the locales directory.

The timezoneJS.Date object is API-compatible with JS Date, with the same getter and setter methods -- it should work fine in any code that works with normal JavaScript Dates. Mailing list Overview The timezoneJS.Date object gives you full-blown timezone support, independent from the timezone set on the end-user's machine running the browser. It uses the Olson zoneinfo files for its timezone data. The constructor function and setter methods use proxy JavaScript Date objects behind the scenes, so you can use strings like '10/22/2006' with the constructor. You also get the same sensible wraparound behavior with numeric parameters (like setting a value of 14 for the month wraps around to the next March). The other significant difference from the built-in JavaScript Date is that timezoneJS.Date also has named properties that store the values of year, month, date, etc., so it can be directly serialized to JSON and used for data transfer. Setup First you'll need to include the code on your page. Both timezoneJS.Date, and the supporting code it needs in timezoneJS.timezone are bundled in the date.js file in src directory. Include the code on your page with a normal JavaScript script include, like so: <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/js/timezone-js/src/date.js"">  Next you'll need the Olson time zone files -- timezoneJS.Date uses the raw Olson data to calculate timezone offsets. The Olson region files are simple, structured text data, which download quickly and parse easily. (They also compress to a very small size.) Here is an example of how to get the Olson time zone files: ##!/bin/bash  # NOTE: Run from your webroot  # Create the /tz directory mkdir tz  # Download the latest Olson files curl ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/tzdata-latest.tar.gz -o tz/tzdata-latest.tar.gz  # Expand the files tar -xvzf tz/tzdata-latest.tar.gz -C tz  # Optionally, you can remove the downloaded archives. rm tz/tzdata-latest.tar.gz Then you'll need to make the files available to the timezoneJS.timezone code, and initialize the code to parse your default region. (This will be North America if you don't change it). No sense in downloading and parsing timezone data for the entire world if you're not going to be using it. Put your directory of Olson files somewhere under your Web server root, and point timezoneJS.timezone.zoneFileBasePath to it. Then call the init function. Your code will look something like this: timezoneJS.timezone.zoneFileBasePath = '/tz'; timezoneJS.timezone.init({ callback: cb }); If you use timezoneJS.Date with Fleegix.js, jQuery or jQuery-compatible libraries (like Zepto.js), there's nothing else you need to do -- timezones for North America will be loaded and parsed on initial page load, and others will be downloaded and parsed on-the-fly, as needed. If you want to use this code with some other JavaScript toolkit, you'll need to overwrite your own transport method by setting timezoneJS.timezone.transport = someFunction method. Take a look at test-utils.js in spec for an example. NOTE: By default init() is async so you'll need to specify a callback function such as init({ callback: cb }). Otherwise set init({ async: false }) to turn off async. Usage The timezoneJS.Date constructor is compatible to the normal JavaScript Date constructor, but additional allows to pass an optional tz (timezone). In the following cases the passed date/time is unambiguous: timezoneJS.Date(millis, [tz]) timezoneJS.Date(Date, [tz]) timezoneJS.Date(dt_str_tz, [tz]) dt_str_tz is a date string containing timezone information, i.e. containing Z, T or a timezone offset matching the regular expression /[+-][0-9]{4}/ (e.g. +0200). The one-stop shop for cross-browser JavaScript Date parsing behavior provides detailed information about JavaScript date formats. In the following cases the date is assumed to be a date in timezone tz or a locale date if tz is not provided: timezoneJS.Date(year, mon, day, [hour], [min], [second], [tz]) timezoneJS.Date(dt_str, [tz]) dt_str is a date string containing no timezone information. Examples Create a timezoneJS.Date the same way as a normal JavaScript Date, but append a timezone parameter on the end: var dt = new timezoneJS.Date('10/31/2008', 'America/New_York'); var dt = new timezoneJS.Date(2008, 9, 31, 11, 45, 'America/Los_Angeles'); Naturally enough, the getTimezoneOffset method returns the timezone offset in minutes based on the timezone you set for the date. // Pre-DST-leap var dt = new timezoneJS.Date(2006, 9, 29, 1, 59, 'America/Los_Angeles'); dt.getTimezoneOffset(); => 420 // Post-DST-leap var dt = new timezoneJS.Date(2006, 9, 29, 2, 0, 'America/Los_Angeles'); dt.getTimezoneOffset(); => 480 Just as you'd expect, the getTime method gives you the UTC timestamp for the given date: var dtA = new timezoneJS.Date(2007, 9, 31, 10, 30, 'America/Los_Angeles'); var dtB = new timezoneJS.Date(2007, 9, 31, 12, 30, 'America/Chicago'); // Same timestamp dtA.getTime(); => 1193855400000 dtB.getTime(); => 1193855400000 You can set (or reset) the timezone using the setTimezone method: var dt = new timezoneJS.Date('10/31/2006', 'America/Juneau'); dt.getTimezoneOffset(); => 540 dt.setTimezone('America/Chicago'); dt.getTimezoneOffset(); => 300 dt.setTimezone('Pacific/Honolulu'); dt.getTimezoneOffset(); => 600 The getTimezone method tells you what timezone a timezoneJS.Date is set to: var dt = new timezoneJS.Date('12/27/2010', 'Asia/Tokyo'); dt.getTimezone(); => 'Asia/Tokyo' You can use getTimezoneAbbreviation method to get timezone abbreviation: var dt = new timezoneJS.Date('10/31/2008', 'America/New_York'); dt.getTimezoneAbbreviation(); => 'EDT' Customizing If you don't change it, the timezone region that loads on initialization is North America (the Olson 'northamerica' file). To change that to another reqion, set timezoneJS.timezone.defaultZoneFile to your desired region, like so: timezoneJS.timezone.zoneFileBasePath = '/tz'; timezoneJS.timezone.defaultZoneFile = 'asia'; timezoneJS.timezone.init(); If you want to preload multiple regions, set it to an array, like this: timezoneJS.timezone.zoneFileBasePath = '/tz'; timezoneJS.timezone.defaultZoneFile = ['asia', 'backward', 'northamerica', 'southamerica']; timezoneJS.timezone.init(); By default the timezoneJS.Date timezone code lazy-loads the timezone data files, pulling them down and parsing them only as needed. For example, if you go with the out-of-the-box setup, you'll have all the North American timezones pre-loaded -- but if you were to add a date with a timezone of 'Asia/Seoul,' it would grab the 'asia' Olson file and parse it before calculating the timezone offset for that date. You can change this behavior by changing the value of timezoneJS.timezone.loadingScheme. The three possible values are: timezoneJS.timezone.loadingSchemes.PRELOAD_ALL -- this will preload all the timezone data files for all reqions up front. This setting would only make sense if you know your users will be using timezones from all around the world, and you prefer taking the up-front load time to the small on-the-fly lag from lazy loading. timezoneJS.timezone.loadingSchemes.LAZY_LOAD -- the default. Loads some amount of data up front, then lazy-loads any other needed timezone data as needed. timezoneJS.timezone.loadingSchemes.MANUAL_LOAD -- Preloads no data, and does no lazy loading. Use this setting if you're loading pre-parsed JSON timezone data. Pre-Parsed JSON Data If you know beforehand what specific cities your users are going to be using, you can reduce load times specifically by creating a pre-parsed JSON data file containing only the timezone info for those specific cities. The src directory contains 2 command-line JavaScript scripts that can generate this kind of JSON data: node-preparse.js: Uses Node to preparse and populate data. preparse.js: This script requires the Rhino (Java) JavaScript engine to run, since the stock SpiderMonkey (C) engine doesn't come with file I/O capabilities. Use the script like this: rhino preparse.js zoneFileDirectory [exemplarCities] > outputfile.json Or: node node-preparse.js zoneFileDirectory [exemplarCities] > outputfile.json The first parameter is the directory where the script can find the Olson zoneinfo files. The second (optional) param should be a comma-delimited list of timzeone cities to create the JSON data for. If that parameter isn't passed, the script will generate the JSON data for all the files. rhino preparse.js olson_files \ ""Asia/Tokyo, America/New_York, Europe/London"" \ > major_cities.json  rhino preparse.js olson_files > all_cities.json Or: node node-preparse.js olson_files \ ""Asia/Tokyo, America/New_York, Europe/London"" \ > major_cities.json  node node-preparse.js olson_files > all_cities.json Once you have your file of JSON data, set your loading scheme to timezoneJS.timezone.loadingSchemes.MANUAL_LOAD, and load the JSON data with loadZoneJSONData, like this: var _tz = timezoneJS.timezone; _tz.loadingScheme = _tz.loadingSchemes.MANUAL_LOAD; _tz.loadZoneJSONData('/major_cities.json', true); Since the limited set of data will be much smaller than any of the zoneinfo files, and the JSON data is deserialized with eval or JSON.parse, this method is significantly faster than the default setup. However, it only works if you know beforehand exactly what timezones you want to use. Compressing The Olson timezone data files are simple, space- and linefeed-delimited data. The abundance of whitespace means they compress very, very well. If you plan to use timezoneJS.Date in a production Web app, it's highly recommended that you first strip the copious comments found in every Olson file, and serve compressed versions of the files to all browsers that can handle it. (Note that IE6 reports itself as able to work with gzipped data, but has numerous problems with it.) Just to give you an idea of the difference -- merely stripping out the comments from the 'northamerica' file reduces its size by two-thirds -- from 103K to 32K. Gzipping the stripped file reduces it down to 6.5K -- probably smaller than most of the graphics in your app. The src directory has a sample Ruby script that you can use to strip comments from Olson data files. Development This project use Jake to build. In order to see available tasks, do jake -T. The build sequence is: jake test:init: Download and extract tz files to lib/tz. jake test: Run jasmine-node.

Installation If you use bower: bower install countdown.js  Otherwise, you can download it from here. API new Countdown(duration, onTick, onComplete) Begins a countdown. After duration time has passed, the function onCompletewill be executed. Every second, the onTick function will be executed. Example: var countdown = new Countdown(5, function(seconds) {   console.log(seconds); //log the number of seconds that have passed }, function() {    console.log(""Countdown complete!"") //log that the countdown has complete }); abort() Terminates countdown. Example: countdown.abort(); getRemainingTime() Returns remaining time in seconds.

This is an attempt to fill that gap. List of build-in methods can be found for example from Dive Into JavaScript. Originally started as an Underscore.js extension but is a full standalone library nowadays. Upgrading from 2.x to 3.x? Please read the changelog. Usage For Node.js, Browserify and Webpack Install from npm npm install underscore.string  Require individual functions var slugify = require(""underscore.string/slugify"");  slugify(""Hello world!""); // => hello-world or load the full library to enable chaining var s = require(""underscore.string"");  s(""   epeli  "").trim().capitalize().value(); // => ""Epeli"" but especially when using with Browserify the individual function approach is recommended because using it you only add those functions to your bundle you use. In Meteor From your Meteor project folder     meteor add underscorestring:underscore.string and you'll be able to access the library with the s global from both the server and the client. s.slugify(""Hello world!""); // => hello-world  s(""   epeli  "").trim().capitalize().value(); // => ""Epeli"" Others The dist/underscore.string.js file is an UMD build. You can load it using an AMD loader such as RequireJS or just stick it to a web page and access the library from the s global. Underscore.js/Lo-Dash integration It is still possible use as Underscore.js/Lo-Dash extension _.mixin(s.exports()); But it's not recommended since include, contains, reverse and join are dropped because they collide with the functions already defined by Underscore.js. Lo-Dash-FP/Ramda integration If you want to use underscore.string with ramdajs or Lo-Dash-FP you can use underscore.string.fp. npm install underscore.string.fp  var S = require('underscore.string.fp'); var filter = require('lodash-fp').filter; var filter = require('ramda').filter;  filter(S.startsWith('.'), [   '.vimrc',   'foo.md',   '.zshrc' ]); // => ['.vimrc', '.zshrc'] Download Development version Uncompressed with Comments Production version Minified API Individual functions numberFormat(number, [ decimals=0, decimalSeparator='.', orderSeparator=',']) => string Formats the numbers. numberFormat(1000, 2); // => ""1,000.00""  numberFormat(123456789.123, 5, ""."", "",""); // => ""123,456,789.12300"" levenshtein(string1, string2) => number Calculates Levenshtein distance between two strings. levenshtein(""kitten"", ""kittah""); // => 2 capitalize(string, [lowercaseRest=false]) => string Converts first letter of the string to uppercase.

Returns an immutable chain object with the string functions as methods which return a new chain object instead of the plain string value. The chain object includes also following native Javascript string methods: toUpperCase toLowerCase split replace slice substring substr concat chain.value() Return the string value from the chain s(""  foo  "").trim().capitalize().value(); // => ""Foo"" When calling a method which does not return a string the resulting value is immediately returned s("" foobar "").trim().startsWith(""foo""); // => true chain.tap(function) => chain Tap into the chain with a custom function s(""foo"").tap(function(value){   return value + ""bar""; }).value(); // => ""foobar"" Aliases strip     = trim lstrip    = ltrim rstrip    = rtrim center    = lrpad rjust     = lpad ljust     = rpad contains  = include q         = quote toBool    = toBoolean camelcase = camelize Maintainers This library is maintained by Esa-Matti Suuronen – @epeli Christoph Hermann – @stoeffel Licence The MIT License Copyright (c) 2011 Esa-Matti Suuronen esa-matti@suuronen.org Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the ""Software""), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Originally, it modified the String prototype. But I quickly learned that in JavaScript, this is considered poor practice. Why? Personally, I prefer the cleanliness of the way code looks when it appears to be native methods. i.e. when you modify native JavaScript prototypes. However, if any app dependency required string.js, then the app's string prototype would be modified in every module. This could be troublesome. So I settled on creating a wrapper a la jQuery style. For those of you prototype hatin' fools, there is the method extendPrototype(). Here's a list of alternative frameworks: Prototype Framework's String library Uize.String Google Closure's String Underscore.string Sugar.js php.js Why wasn't I happy with any of them? They are all static methods that don't seem to support chaining in a clean way 'OR' they have an odd dependency. Sugar is the notable exception. Installation npm install --save string  Experiment with String.js Now Assuming you're on http://stringjs.com, just simply open up the Webkit inspector in either Chrome or Safari, or the web console in Firefox and you'll notice that string.js is included in this page so that you can start experimenting with it right away. Usage Node.js var S = require('string'); Originally, I was using $s but glancing over the code, it was easy to confuse $s for string.js with $ for jQuery. Feel free to use the most convenient variable for you.

Both var doesIt = S('my cool string').left(2).endsWith('y'); //true Access the wrapped string using s variable or toString() var name = S('Your name is JP').right(2).s; //'JP' is the same as… var name = S('Your name is JP').right(2).toString(); //'JP' Still like the clean look of calling these methods directly on native Strings? No problem. Call extendPrototype(). Make sure to not call this at the module level, at it'll effect the entire application lifecycle. You should really only use this at the method level. The one exception being if your application will not be a dependency of another application.

Report any browser issues here: https://github.com/jprichardson/string.js/issues Extending string.js See: https://github.com/jprichardson/string.js/pull/57 Native JavaScript Methods string.js imports all of the native JavaScript methods. This is for convenience. The only difference is that the imported methods return string.js objects instead of native JavaScript strings. The one exception to this is the method charAt(index). This is because charAt() only returns a string of length one. This is typically done for comparisons and a string.js object will have little to no value here. All of the native methods support chaining with the string.js methods. Example: var S = require('string');  var phrase = S('JavaScript is the best scripting language ever!'); var sub = 'best scripting'; var pos = phrase.indexOf(sub); console.log(phrase.substr(pos, sub.length).truncate(8)); //best... Methods See test file for more details. I use the same nomenclature as Objective-C regarding methods. + means static or class method. - means non-static or instance method. - constructor(nativeJsString) This creates a new string.js object. The parameter can be anything. The toString() method will be called on any objects. Some native objects are used in some functions such as toCSV(). Example: S('hello').s //""hello"" S(['a,b']).s //""a,b"" S({hi: 'jp'}).s //""[object Object]"""" - between(left, right) Extracts a string between left and right strings. Example: S('<a>foo</a>').between('<a>', '</a>').s // => 'foo' S('<a>foo</a></a>').between('<a>', '</a>').s // => 'foo' S('<a><a>foo</a></a>').between('<a>', '</a>').s // => '<a>foo' S('<a>foo').between('<a>', '</a>').s // => '' S('Some strings } are very {weird}, dont you think?').between('{', '}').s // => 'weird' S('This is a test string').between('test').s // => ' string' S('This is a test string').between('', 'test').s // => 'This is a ' - camelize() Remove any underscores or dashes and convert a string into camel casing.

Example: S('jon').capitalize().s; //'Jon' S('JP').capitalize().s; //'Jp' - chompLeft(prefix) Removes prefix from start of string. Example: S('foobar').chompLeft('foo').s; //'bar' S('foobar').chompLeft('bar').s; //'foobar' - chompRight(suffix) Removes suffix from end of string. Example: S('foobar').chompRight('bar').s; //'foo' S('foobar').chompRight('foo').s; //'foobar' - collapseWhitespace() Converts all adjacent whitespace characters to a single space. Example: var str = S('  String   \t libraries are   \n\n\t fun\n!  ').collapseWhitespace().s; //'String libraries are fun !' - contains(ss) Returns true if the string contains ss. Alias: include() Example: S('JavaScript is one of the best languages!').contains('one'); //true - count(substring) Returns the count of the number of occurrences of the substring.

Not really necessary to use. However, JS engines will look at an object and display its toString() result. Example: S('my name is JP.').capitalize().toString(); //My name is JP. var a = ""Hello "" + S('joe!'); //a = ""Hello joe!"" S(""Hello"").toString() === S(""Hello"").s; //true - trim() Return the string with leading and trailing whitespace removed. Reverts to native trim() if it exists.

Example: S('dataRate').underscore().s; //'data_rate' S('CarSpeed').underscore().s; //'car_speed' S('yesWeCan').underscore().s; //'yes_we_can' - unescapeHTML() Unescapes the html. Example: S('&lt;div&gt;hi&lt;/div&gt;').unescapeHTML().s; //<div>hi</div> - wrapHTML() wrapHTML helps to avoid concatenation of element with string. the string will be wrapped with HTML Element and their attributes. Example: S('Venkat').wrapHTML().s //<span>Venkat</span> S('Venkat').wrapHTML('div').s //<div>Venkat</div> S('Venkat').wrapHTML('div', {     ""class"": ""left bullet"" }).s //<div class=""left bullet"">Venkat</div> S('Venkat').wrapHTML('div', {     ""id"": ""content"",     ""class"": ""left bullet"" }).s // <div id=""content"" class=""left bullet"">Venkat</div> + VERSION Returns native JavaScript string containing the version of string.js. Example: S.VERSION; //1.0.0 Quirks decodeHtmlEntities() converts &nbsp; to 0xa0 (160) and not 0x10 (20). Most browsers consider 0xa0 to be whitespace characters, Internet Explorer does not despite it being part of the ECMA standard. Google Closure does a good job of normalizing this behavior. This may need to be fixed in string.js at some point in time. Testing Node.js Install the dev dependencies: $ npm install string --development  Install mocha globally: $ npm install -g mocha  Then navigate to the installed directory: $ cd node_modules/string/  Run test package: $ mocha test  Browser Click here to run the tests in your web browser. Credits I have looked at the code by the creators in the libraries mentioned in Motivation. As noted in the source code, I've specifically used code from Google Closure (Google Inc), Underscore String Esa-Matti Suuronen, and php.js (http://phpjs.org/authors/index), Substack and TJ Holowaychuk. Contributions If you contribute to this library, just modify string.js, string.test.js, and update README.md. I'll update the website docs and generate the new string.min.js, changelog and version.

It supports all standardized named character references as per HTML, handles ambiguous ampersands and other edge cases just like a browser would, has an extensive test suite, and — contrary to many other JavaScript solutions — he handles astral Unicode symbols just fine. An online demo is available. Installation Via npm: npm install he Via Bower: bower install he Via Component: component install mathiasbynens/he In a browser: <script src=""he.js""></script> In Node.js, io.js, Narwhal, and RingoJS: var he = require('he'); In Rhino: load('he.js'); Using an AMD loader like RequireJS: require(   {     'paths': {       'he': 'path/to/he'     }   },   ['he'],   function(he) {     console.log(he);   } ); API he.version A string representing the semantic version number. he.encode(text, options) This function takes a string of text and encodes (by default) any symbols that aren’t printable ASCII symbols and &, <, >, "", ', and `, replacing them with character references. he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux'); // → 'foo &#xA9; bar &#x2260; baz &#x1D306; qux' As long as the input string contains allowed code points only, the return value of this function is always valid HTML. Any (invalid) code points that cannot be represented using a character reference in the input are not encoded. he.encode('foo \0 bar'); // → 'foo \0 bar' The options object is optional. It recognizes the following properties: useNamedReferences The default value for the useNamedReferences option is false. This means that encode() will not use any named character references (e.g. &copy;) in the output — hexadecimal escapes (e.g. &#xA9;) will be used instead. Set it to true to enable the use of named references. Note that if compatibility with older browsers is a concern, this option should remain disabled. // Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`): he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux'); // → 'foo &#xA9; bar &#x2260; baz &#x1D306; qux'  // Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly disallow named references: he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {   'useNamedReferences': false }); // → 'foo &#xA9; bar &#x2260; baz &#x1D306; qux'  // Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly allow named references: he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {   'useNamedReferences': true }); // → 'foo &copy; bar &ne; baz &#x1D306; qux' decimal The default value for the decimal option is false. If the option is enabled, encode will generally use decimal escapes (e.g. &#169;) rather than hexadecimal escapes (e.g. &#xA9;). Beside of this replacement, the basic behavior remains the same when combined with other options. For example: if both options useNamedReferences and decimal are enabled, named references (e.g. &copy;) are used over decimal escapes. HTML entities without a named reference are encoded using decimal escapes. // Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`): he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux'); // → 'foo &#xA9; bar &#x2260; baz &#x1D306; qux'  // Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly disable decimal escapes: he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {   'decimal': false }); // → 'foo &#xA9; bar &#x2260; baz &#x1D306; qux'  // Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly enable decimal escapes: he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {   'decimal': true }); // → 'foo &#169; bar &#8800; baz &#119558; qux'  // Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly allow named references and decimal escapes: he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {   'useNamedReferences': true,   'decimal': true }); // → 'foo &copy; bar &ne; baz &#119558; qux' encodeEverything The default value for the encodeEverything option is false. This means that encode() will not use any character references for printable ASCII symbols that don’t need escaping. Set it to true to encode every symbol in the input string. When set to true, this option takes precedence over allowUnsafeSymbols (i.e. setting the latter to true in such a case has no effect). // Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`): he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux'); // → 'foo &#xA9; bar &#x2260; baz &#x1D306; qux'  // Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly encode all symbols: he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {   'encodeEverything': true }); // → '&#x66;&#x6F;&#x6F;&#x20;&#xA9;&#x20;&#x62;&#x61;&#x72;&#x20;&#x2260;&#x20;&#x62;&#x61;&#x7A;&#x20;&#x1D306;&#x20;&#x71;&#x75;&#x78;'  // This setting can be combined with the `useNamedReferences` option: he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux', {   'encodeEverything': true,   'useNamedReferences': true }); // → '&#x66;&#x6F;&#x6F;&#x20;&copy;&#x20;&#x62;&#x61;&#x72;&#x20;&ne;&#x20;&#x62;&#x61;&#x7A;&#x20;&#x1D306;&#x20;&#x71;&#x75;&#x78;' strict The default value for the strict option is false. This means that encode() will encode any HTML text content you feed it, even if it contains any symbols that cause parse errors. To throw an error when such invalid HTML is encountered, set the strict option to true. This option makes it possible to use he as part of HTML parsers and HTML validators. // Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`, i.e. error-tolerant mode): he.encode('\x01'); // → '&#x1;'  // Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly enable error-tolerant mode: he.encode('\x01', {   'strict': false }); // → '&#x1;'  // Passing an `options` object to `encode`, to explicitly enable strict mode: he.encode('\x01', {   'strict': true }); // → Parse error allowUnsafeSymbols The default value for the allowUnsafeSymbols option is false. This means that characters that are unsafe for use in HTML content (&, <, >, "", ', and `) will be encoded. When set to true, only non-ASCII characters will be encoded. If the encodeEverything option is set to true, this option will be ignored. he.encode('foo © and & ampersand', {   'allowUnsafeSymbols': true }); // → 'foo &#xA9; and & ampersand' Overriding default encode options globally The global default setting can be overridden by modifying the he.encode.options object. This saves you from passing in an options object for every call to encode if you want to use the non-default setting. // Read the global default setting: he.encode.options.useNamedReferences; // → `false` by default  // Override the global default setting: he.encode.options.useNamedReferences = true;  // Using the global default setting, which is now `true`: he.encode('foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux'); // → 'foo &copy; bar &ne; baz &#x1D306; qux' he.decode(html, options) This function takes a string of HTML and decodes any named and numerical character references in it using the algorithm described in section 12.2.4.69 of the HTML spec. he.decode('foo &copy; bar &ne; baz &#x1D306; qux'); // → 'foo © bar ≠ baz 𝌆 qux' The options object is optional. It recognizes the following properties: isAttributeValue The default value for the isAttributeValue option is false. This means that decode() will decode the string as if it were used in a text context in an HTML document. HTML has different rules for parsing character references in attribute values — set this option to true to treat the input string as if it were used as an attribute value. // Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`, i.e. HTML text context): he.decode('foo&ampbar'); // → 'foo&bar'  // Passing an `options` object to `decode`, to explicitly assume an HTML text context: he.decode('foo&ampbar', {   'isAttributeValue': false }); // → 'foo&bar'  // Passing an `options` object to `decode`, to explicitly assume an HTML attribute value context: he.decode('foo&ampbar', {   'isAttributeValue': true }); // → 'foo&ampbar' strict The default value for the strict option is false. This means that decode() will decode any HTML text content you feed it, even if it contains any entities that cause parse errors. To throw an error when such invalid HTML is encountered, set the strict option to true. This option makes it possible to use he as part of HTML parsers and HTML validators. // Using the global default setting (defaults to `false`, i.e. error-tolerant mode): he.decode('foo&ampbar'); // → 'foo&bar'  // Passing an `options` object to `decode`, to explicitly enable error-tolerant mode: he.decode('foo&ampbar', {   'strict': false }); // → 'foo&bar'  // Passing an `options` object to `decode`, to explicitly enable strict mode: he.decode('foo&ampbar', {   'strict': true }); // → Parse error Overriding default decode options globally The global default settings for the decode function can be overridden by modifying the he.decode.options object. This saves you from passing in an options object for every call to decode if you want to use a non-default setting. // Read the global default setting: he.decode.options.isAttributeValue; // → `false` by default  // Override the global default setting: he.decode.options.isAttributeValue = true;  // Using the global default setting, which is now `true`: he.decode('foo&ampbar'); // → 'foo&ampbar' he.escape(text) This function takes a string of text and escapes it for use in text contexts in XML or HTML documents. Only the following characters are escaped: &, <, >, "", ', and `. he.escape('<img src=\'x\' onerror=""prompt(1)"">'); // → '&lt;img src=&#x27;x&#x27; onerror=&quot;prompt(1)&quot;&gt;' he.unescape(html, options) he.unescape is an alias for he.decode. It takes a string of HTML and decodes any named and numerical character references in it. Using the he binary To use the he binary in your shell, simply install he globally using npm: npm install -g he After that you will be able to encode/decode HTML entities from the command line: $ he --encode 'föo ♥ bår 𝌆 baz' f&#xF6;o &#x2665; b&#xE5;r &#x1D306; baz  $ he --encode --use-named-refs 'föo ♥ bår 𝌆 baz' f&ouml;o &hearts; b&aring;r &#x1D306; baz  $ he --decode 'f&ouml;o &hearts; b&aring;r &#x1D306; baz' föo ♥ bår 𝌆 baz Read a local text file, encode it for use in an HTML text context, and save the result to a new file: $ he --encode < foo.txt > foo-escaped.html Or do the same with an online text file: $ curl -sL ""http://git.io/HnfEaw"" | he --encode > escaped.html Or, the opposite — read a local file containing a snippet of HTML in a text context, decode it back to plain text, and save the result to a new file: $ he --decode < foo-escaped.html > foo.txt Or do the same with an online HTML snippet: $ curl -sL ""http://git.io/HnfEaw"" | he --decode > decoded.txt See he --help for the full list of options. Support he has been tested in at least: Chrome 27-50 Firefox 3-45 Safari 4-9 Opera 10-12, 15–37 IE 6–11 Edge Narwhal 0.3.2 Node.js v0.10, v0.12, v4, v5 PhantomJS 1.9.0 Rhino 1.7RC4 RingoJS 0.8-0.11 Unit tests & code coverage After cloning this repository, run npm install to install the dependencies needed for he development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul globally using npm install istanbul -g. Once that’s done, you can run the unit tests in Node using npm test or node tests/tests.js. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, and web browsers as well, use grunt test. To generate the code coverage report, use grunt cover.

Use ES2015 template literals instead whenever possible. Before const str = '' + '<!doctype html>' + '<html>' + '   <body>' + '       <h1>❤ unicorns</h1>' + '   </body>' + '</html>' + ''; After const str = multiline(function(){/* <!doctype html> <html>     <body>         <h1>❤ unicorns</h1>     </body> </html> */}); How It works by wrapping the text in a block comment, anonymous function, and a function call. The anonymous function is passed into the function call and the contents of the comment extracted. Even though it's slower than string concat, that shouldn't realistically matter as you can still do 2 million of those a second. Convenience over micro performance always. Install $ npm install --save multiline  Usage Everything after the first newline and before the last will be returned as seen below: const str = multiline(function(){/* <!doctype html> <html>     <body>         <h1>❤ unicorns</h1>     </body> </html> */}); Which outputs: <!doctype html> <html>     <body>         <h1>❤ unicorns</h1>     </body> </html>  Strip indent You can use multiline.stripIndent() to be able to indent your multiline string without preserving the redundant leading whitespace.     const str = multiline.stripIndent(function(){/*             <!doctype html>             <html>                 <body>                     <h1>❤ unicorns</h1>                 </body>             </html>     */}); Which outputs: <!doctype html> <html>     <body>         <h1>❤ unicorns</h1>     </body> </html>  String substitution console.log() supports string substitution: const str = 'unicorns';  console.log(multiline(function(){/*   I love %s */}), str);  //=> 'I love unicorns' Use cases CLI help output Test fixtures Queries - here an example in Cypher, the query language for Neo4j CLI welcome message - here in a Yeoman generator Have one? Let me know. Experiment I've also done an experiment where you don't need the anonymous function. It's too fragile and slow to be practical though. It generates a callstack and extracts the contents of the comment in the function call. const str = multiline(/* <!doctype html> <html>     <body>         <h1>❤ unicorns</h1>     </body> </html> */); FAQ But JS already has multiline strings with \? const str = 'foo\ bar'; This is not a multiline string. It's line-continuation. It doesn't preserve newlines, which is the main reason for wanting multiline strings. You would need to do the following: const str = 'foo\n\ bar'; But then you could just as well concatenate: const str = 'foo\n' + 'bar'; Browser While it does work fine in the browser, it's mainly intended for use in Node.js. Use at your own risk. Install $ npm install --save multiline  (with Browserify) $ bower install --save multiline  Compatibility Latest Chrome Firefox >=17 Safari >=4 Opera >=9 Internet Explorer >=6 Minification Even though minifiers strip comments by default there are ways to preserve them: Uglify: Use /*@preserve instead of /* and enable the comments option Closure Compiler: Use /*@preserve instead of /* YUI Compressor: Use /*! instead of /* You also need to add console.log after the comment so it's not removed as dead-code. The final result would be: const str = multiline(function(){/*!@preserve <!doctype html> <html>     <body>         <h1>❤ unicorns</h1>     </body> </html> */console.log}); License MIT © Sindre Sorhus Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Leading ? or # are ignored, so you can pass location.search or location.hash directly. The returned object is created with Object.create(null) and thus does not have a prototype. .stringify(object, [options]) Stringify an object into a query string, sorting the keys. strict Type: boolean Default: true Strictly encode URI components with strict-uri-encode. It uses encodeURIComponent if set to false. You probably don't care about this option. encode Type: boolean Default: true URL encode the keys and values. .extract(string) Extract a query string from a URL that can be passed into .parse(). Nesting This module intentionally doesn't support nesting as it's not spec'd and varies between implementations, which causes a lot of edge cases. You're much better off just converting the object to a JSON string: queryString.stringify({     foo: 'bar',     nested: JSON.stringify({         unicorn: 'cake'     }) }); //=> 'foo=bar&nested=%7B%22unicorn%22%3A%22cake%22%7D' However, there is support for multiple instances of the same key: queryString.parse('likes=cake&name=bob&likes=icecream'); //=> {likes: ['cake', 'icecream'], name: 'bob'}  queryString.stringify({color: ['taupe', 'chartreuse'], id: '515'}); //=> 'color=chartreuse&color=taupe&id=515' License MIT © Sindre Sorhus Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

'&' : '?';  url += separator + encodeURIComponent(""foo"") + ""="" + encodeURIComponent(""bar""); Things are looking up with URL and the URL spec but until we can safely rely on that API, have a look at URI.js for a clean and simple API for mutating URIs: var url = new URI(""http://example.org/foo?bar=baz""); url.addQuery(""foo"", ""bar""); URI.js is here to help with that. API Example // mutating URLs URI(""http://example.org/foo.html?hello=world"")   .username(""rodneyrehm"")     // -> http://rodneyrehm@example.org/foo.html?hello=world   .username("""")     // -> http://example.org/foo.html?hello=world   .directory(""bar"")     // -> http://example.org/bar/foo.html?hello=world   .suffix(""xml"")     // -> http://example.org/bar/foo.xml?hello=world   .query("""")     // -> http://example.org/bar/foo.xml   .tld(""com"")     // -> http://example.com/bar/foo.xml   .query({ foo: ""bar"", hello: [""world"", ""mars""] });     // -> http://example.com/bar/foo.xml?foo=bar&hello=world&hello=mars  // cleaning things up URI(""?&foo=bar&&foo=bar&foo=baz&"")   .normalizeQuery();     // -> ?foo=bar&foo=baz  // working with relative paths URI(""/foo/bar/baz.html"")   .relativeTo(""/foo/bar/world.html"");     // -> ./baz.html  URI(""/foo/bar/baz.html"")   .relativeTo(""/foo/bar/sub/world.html"")     // -> ../baz.html   .absoluteTo(""/foo/bar/sub/world.html"");     // -> /foo/bar/baz.html  // URI Templates URI.expand(""/foo/{dir}/{file}"", {   dir: ""bar"",   file: ""world.html"" }); // -> /foo/bar/world.html See the About Page and API Docs for more stuff. Using URI.js URI.js (without plugins) has a gzipped weight of about 7KB - if you include all extensions you end up at about 13KB. So unless you need second level domain support and use URI templates, we suggest you don't include them in your build. If you don't need a full featured URI mangler, it may be worth looking into the much smaller parser-only alternatives listed below. URI.js is available through npm, bower, bowercdn, cdnjs and manually from the build page: # using bower bower install uri.js  # using npm npm install urijs Browser I guess you'll manage to use the build tool or follow the instructions below to combine and minify the various files into URI.min.js - and I'm fairly certain you know how to <script src="".../URI.min.js""></script> that sucker, too. Node.js and NPM Install with npm install urijs or add ""urijs"" to the dependencies in your package.json. // load URI.js var URI = require('urijs'); // load an optional module (e.g. URITemplate) var URITemplate = require('urijs/src/URITemplate');  URI(""/foo/bar/baz.html"")   .relativeTo(""/foo/bar/sub/world.html"")     // -> ../baz.html RequireJS Clone the URI.js repository or use a package manager to get URI.js into your project. require.config({   paths: {     urijs: 'where-you-put-uri.js/src'   } });  require(['urijs/URI'], function(URI) {   console.log(""URI.js and dependencies: "", URI(""//amazon.co.uk"").is('sld') ? 'loaded' : 'failed'); }); require(['urijs/URITemplate'], function(URITemplate) {   console.log(""URITemplate.js and dependencies: "", URITemplate._cache ? 'loaded' : 'failed'); }); Minify See the build tool or use Google Closure Compiler: // ==ClosureCompiler== // @compilation_level SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS // @output_file_name URI.min.js // @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/IPv6.js // @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/punycode.js // @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/SecondLevelDomains.js // @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/URI.js // @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/URITemplate.js // ==/ClosureCompiler==  Resources Documents specifying how URLs work: URL - Living Standard RFC 3986 - Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax RFC 3987 - Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) RFC 2732 - Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's RFC 2368 - The mailto: URL Scheme RFC 2141 - URN Syntax IANA URN Namespace Registry Punycode: A Bootstring encoding of Unicode for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) application/x-www-form-urlencoded (Query String Parameters) and application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding algorithm What every web developer must know about URL encoding Informal stuff Parsing URLs for Fun and Profit Naming URL components How other environments do things Java URI Class Java Inet6Address Class Node.js URL API Discussion on Hacker News Forks / Code-borrow node-dom-urls passy's partial implementation of the W3C URL Spec Draft for Node urlutils cofounders' window.URL constructor for Node Alternatives If you don't like URI.js, you may like one of the following libraries.

Goal To have a convenient way working with URLs in JavaScript. From time to time there are usual tasks when it is required to add or remove some parameters to some basic URL or change some other URL parts. There is no easy standard way to do it in JavaScript. This small library intended to fix that problem Supported Browsers This library was tested under: IE 7+ Chrome 25+ Opera 12.15+ Firefox 20+ Android browser 2.3+ NodeJS 0.10+ Theoretically it should work fine with newer or older versions of these browsers, but it was not fully tested yet. If you'll find any compatibility issues, please, let me know by leaving a bug report here: https://github.com/Mikhus/domurl/issues You can run basic tests for your browser here: https://rawgit.com/Mikhus/domurl/master/test/url.html or run test.html from this repository locally. If any test has not been passed, please, open a bug report as described above providing browser and OS version on each test which has been failed. How To Use First of all it is required to include Url class on the page. It can be simply done as <script src=""url.min.js""></script>  Then any time it's required to do some work over the URL string, it's just required to instantiate the Url object and work with that object instead of initial string. See API description below to get a clue. Install with JAM It is possible also to install domurl via JAM repository (http://jamjs.org/). Could be simply done as: $ jam install domurl  Install with Bower It is also possible now to install domurl using Bower package repository. Could be done simply as: $ bower install domurl  Install with NPM Domurl is available on NPM and is now works well for both server and browser: $ npm install domurl  API Methods: Url({string} url) -> {Url} Constructor. If url argument is not passed, current document URL will be used. Url.toString() -> {string} Converts URL to string representation. As far as it's spesial method, any time string operations is performed over Url objects this method is automatically called Url.paths({Array} [pathStrings]) Returns Url.path representation as array or sets it via array representation if optional array of pathStrings was provided. Url.encode({string} urlPart) -> {string} Performs URI-compatible encoding of the given urlPart component. It works not the same as native encodeURIComponent()! Url.decode({string} encUrlPart) -> {string} Performs decoding of URI-encoded component. It works not the same as native decodeURIComponent()! Url.clearQuery() -> {Url} Removes all query string parameters from the URL Url.queryLength() -> {Number} Returns total count of the query string parameters. Url.isEmptyQuery() -> {boolean} Returns true if query string contains no parameters, false otherwise. Properties: Url.protocol - protocol part of URL, everything between the beginning of the URL string and ""://"" delimiter (if specified) Url.user - auth user name (if specified) Url.pass - auth user password (if specified) Url.host - host name (if specified) Url.port - port number (if specified) Url.path - document path Url.query - QueryString object. It's a simple Javascript object with automatic string mapping. String representation contains everything after ""?"" and to the end of QueryString Url.hash - Anchor part of the URL. Everything after ""#"" and to the end of anchor Usage Examples var u  = new Url; // curent document URL will be used // or we can instantiate as var u2 = new Url( ""http://example.com/some/path?a=b&c=d#someAnchor""); // it should support relative URLs also var u3 = new Url( ""/my/site/doc/path?foo=bar#baz"");  // get the value of some query string parameter alert( u2.query.a); // or alert( u3.query[""foo""]);  // Manupulating query string parameters u.query.a = [1, 2, 3]; // adds/replaces in query string params a=1&a=2&a=3 u.query.b = 'woohoo';  // adds/replaces in query string param b=woohoo  if (u.query.a instanceof Array) { // the way to add a parameter   u.query.a.push(4); // now it's ""a=1&a=2&a=3&a=4&b=woohoo"" }  else { // if not an array but scalar value here is a way how to convert to array   u.query.a = [u.query.a];   u.query.a.push(8) }  // The way to remove the parameter: delete u.query.a // or: delete u.query[""a""]  // If you need to remove all query string params: u.clearQuery(); alert( u);  // Lookup URL parts: alert(     'protocol = ' + u.protocol + '\n' +     'user = ' + u.user + '\n' +     'pass = ' + u.pass + '\n' +     'host = ' + u.host + '\n' +     'port = ' + u.port + '\n' +     'path = ' + u.path + '\n' +     'query = ' + u.query + '\n' +     'hash = ' + u.hash );  // Manipulating URL parts u.path = '/some/new/path'; // the way to change URL path console.log(u.paths()); u.paths(['some', 'new', 'path']); // change path by array of strings console.log(u.path); u.protocol = 'https' // the way to force https protocol on the source URL  // inject into string var str = '<a href=""' + u + '"">My Cool Link</a>';  // or use in DOM context var a = document.createElement('a'); a.href = u; a.innerHTML = 'test'; document.body.appendChild( a);  // Stringify u += ''; String(u); u.toString(); // NOTE, that usually it will be done automatically, so only in special //       cases direct stringify is required License This code is available under MIT license.

Its prototype is simple: string sprintf(string format , [mixed arg1 [, mixed arg2 [ ,...]]])  The placeholders in the format string are marked by % and are followed by one or more of these elements, in this order: An optional number followed by a $ sign that selects which argument index to use for the value. If not specified, arguments will be placed in the same order as the placeholders in the input string. An optional + sign that forces to preceed the result with a plus or minus sign on numeric values. By default, only the - sign is used on negative numbers. An optional padding specifier that says what character to use for padding (if specified). Possible values are 0 or any other character precedeed by a ' (single quote). The default is to pad with spaces. An optional - sign, that causes sprintf to left-align the result of this placeholder. The default is to right-align the result. An optional number, that says how many characters the result should have. If the value to be returned is shorter than this number, the result will be padded. When used with the j (JSON) type specifier, the padding length specifies the tab size used for indentation. An optional precision modifier, consisting of a . (dot) followed by a number, that says how many digits should be displayed for floating point numbers. When used with the g type specifier, it specifies the number of significant digits. When used on a string, it causes the result to be truncated. A type specifier that can be any of: % — yields a literal % character b — yields an integer as a binary number c — yields an integer as the character with that ASCII value d or i — yields an integer as a signed decimal number e — yields a float using scientific notation u — yields an integer as an unsigned decimal number f — yields a float as is; see notes on precision above g — yields a float as is; see notes on precision above o — yields an integer as an octal number s — yields a string as is t — yields true or false T — yields the type of the argument1 v — yields the primitive value of the specified argument x — yields an integer as a hexadecimal number (lower-case) X — yields an integer as a hexadecimal number (upper-case) j — yields a JavaScript object or array as a JSON encoded string JavaScript vsprintf vsprintf is the same as sprintf except that it accepts an array of arguments, rather than a variable number of arguments: vsprintf(""The first 4 letters of the english alphabet are: %s, %s, %s and %s"", [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d""])  Argument swapping You can also swap the arguments. That is, the order of the placeholders doesn't have to match the order of the arguments. You can do that by simply indicating in the format string which arguments the placeholders refer to: sprintf(""%2$s %3$s a %1$s"", ""cracker"", ""Polly"", ""wants"")  And, of course, you can repeat the placeholders without having to increase the number of arguments. Named arguments Format strings may contain replacement fields rather than positional placeholders. Instead of referring to a certain argument, you can now refer to a certain key within an object. Replacement fields are surrounded by rounded parentheses - ( and ) - and begin with a keyword that refers to a key: var user = {     name: ""Dolly"" } sprintf(""Hello %(name)s"", user) // Hello Dolly  Keywords in replacement fields can be optionally followed by any number of keywords or indexes: var users = [     {name: ""Dolly""},     {name: ""Molly""},     {name: ""Polly""} ] sprintf(""Hello %(users[0].name)s, %(users[1].name)s and %(users[2].name)s"", {users: users}) // Hello Dolly, Molly and Polly  Note: mixing positional and named placeholders is not (yet) supported Computed values You can pass in a function as a dynamic value and it will be invoked (with no arguments) in order to compute the value on-the-fly. sprintf(""Current timestamp: %d"", Date.now) // Current timestamp: 1398005382890 sprintf(""Current date and time: %s"", function() { return new Date().toString() })  AngularJS You can now use sprintf and vsprintf (also aliased as fmt and vfmt respectively) in your AngularJS projects. See demo/. Installation Via Bower bower install sprintf  Or as a node.js module npm install sprintf-js  Usage var sprintf = require(""sprintf-js"").sprintf,     vsprintf = require(""sprintf-js"").vsprintf  sprintf(""%2$s %3$s a %1$s"", ""cracker"", ""Polly"", ""wants"") vsprintf(""The first 4 letters of the english alphabet are: %s, %s, %s and %s"", [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d""])  License sprintf.js is licensed under the terms of the 3-clause BSD license. Notes 1 sprintf doesn't use the typeof operator. As such, the value null is a null, an array is an array (not an object), a date value is a date etc. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

{subdomain: 'mail', domain: 'google', tld: 'com', port: '80', _: 'mail'}  > pattern.match('google'); null make pattern from string > var pattern = new UrlPattern('/api/users/:id'); a pattern is immutable after construction. none of its methods changes its state. that makes it easier to reason about. match pattern against string match returns the extracted segments: > pattern.match('/api/users/10'); {id: '10'} or null if there was no match: > pattern.match('/api/products/5'); null patterns are compiled into regexes which makes .match() superfast. named segments :id (in the example above) is a named segment: a named segment starts with : followed by the name. the name must be at least one character in the regex character set a-zA-Z0-9. when matching, a named segment consumes all characters in the regex character set a-zA-Z0-9-_~ %. a named segment match stops at /, ., ... but not at _, -, , %... you can change these character sets. click here to see how. if a named segment name occurs more than once in the pattern string, then the multiple results are stored in an array on the returned object: > var pattern = new UrlPattern('/api/users/:ids/posts/:ids'); > pattern.match('/api/users/10/posts/5'); {ids: ['10', '5']} optional segments, wildcards and escaping to make part of a pattern optional just wrap it in ( and ): > var pattern = new UrlPattern(   '(http(s)\\://)(:subdomain.):domain.:tld(/*)' ); note that \\ escapes the : in http(s)\\://. you can use \\ to escape (, ), : and * which have special meaning within url-pattern. optional named segments are stored in the corresponding property only if they are present in the source string: > pattern.match('google.de'); {domain: 'google', tld: 'de'} > pattern.match('https://www.google.com'); {subdomain: 'www', domain: 'google', tld: 'com'} * in patterns are wildcards and match anything. wildcard matches are collected in the _ property: > pattern.match('http://mail.google.com/mail'); {subdomain: 'mail', domain: 'google', tld: 'com', _: 'mail'} if there is only one wildcard then _ contains the matching string. otherwise _ contains an array of matching strings. look at the tests for additional examples of .match make pattern from regex > var pattern = new UrlPattern(/^\/api\/(.*)$/); if the pattern was created from a regex an array of the captured groups is returned on a match: > pattern.match('/api/users'); ['users']  > pattern.match('/apiii/test'); null when making a pattern from a regex you can pass an array of keys as the second argument. returns objects on match with each key mapped to a captured value: > var pattern = new UrlPattern(   /^\/api\/([^\/]+)(?:\/(\d+))?$/,   ['resource', 'id'] );  > pattern.match('/api/users'); {resource: 'users'}  > pattern.match('/api/users/5'); {resource: 'users', id: '5'}  > pattern.match('/api/users/foo'); null stringify patterns > var pattern = new UrlPattern('/api/users/:id');  > pattern.stringify({id: 10}) '/api/users/10' optional segments are only included in the output if they contain named segments and/or wildcards and values for those are provided: > var pattern = new UrlPattern('/api/users(/:id)');  > pattern.stringify() '/api/users'  > pattern.stringify({id: 10}) '/api/users/10' wildcards (key = _), deeply nested optional groups and multiple value arrays should stringify as expected. an error is thrown if a value that is not in an optional group is not provided. an error is thrown if an optional segment contains multiple params and not all of them are provided. one provided value for an optional segment makes all values in that optional segment required. look at the tests for additional examples of .stringify customize the pattern syntax finally we can completely change pattern-parsing and regex-compilation to suit our needs: > var options = {}; let's change the char used for escaping (default \\): > options.escapeChar = '!'; let's change the char used to start a named segment (default :): > options.segmentNameStartChar = '$'; let's change the set of chars allowed in named segment names (default a-zA-Z0-9) to also include _ and -: > options.segmentNameCharset = 'a-zA-Z0-9_-'; let's change the set of chars allowed in named segment values (default a-zA-Z0-9-_~ %) to not allow non-alphanumeric chars: > options.segmentValueCharset = 'a-zA-Z0-9'; let's change the chars used to surround an optional segment (default ( and )): > options.optionalSegmentStartChar = '['; > options.optionalSegmentEndChar = ']'; let's change the char used to denote a wildcard (default *): > options.wildcardChar = '?'; pass options as the second argument to the constructor: > var pattern = new UrlPattern(   '[http[s]!://][$sub_domain.]$domain.$toplevel-domain[/?]',   options ); then match: > pattern.match('http://mail.google.com/mail'); {   sub_domain: 'mail',   domain: 'google',   'toplevel-domain': 'com',   _: 'mail' } frequently asked questions how do i match the query part of an URL ? the query part of an URL has very different semantics than the rest. url-pattern is not well suited for parsing the query part. there are good existing libraries for parsing the query part of an URL. https://github.com/hapijs/qs is an example. in the interest of keeping things simple and focused i see no reason to add special support for parsing the query part to url-pattern. i recommend splitting the URL at ?, using url-pattern to parse the first part (scheme, host, port, path) and using https://github.com/hapijs/qs to parse the last part (query). how do i match an IP ? you can't exactly match IPs with url-pattern so you have to fall back to regexes and pass in a regex object. here's how you do it contributing license: MIT Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

It includes the basic building blocks for all these items and is built on top of a Mersenne Twister so it can generate these things with repeatability, if desired. Packages Bower It can also be used with Bower bower install chance  then in the HTML of your app: <!-- Load Chance --> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""app/bower_components/chance/chance.min.js""></script> <script>     // Use Chance immediately!     alert(chance.string()); </script> Component It can also be used with Component component install chancejs/chancejs  then in the HTML of your app: <!-- Load Chance --> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""components/chancejs-chancejs/chance.js""></script> <script>     // Use Chance immediately!     alert(chance.string()); </script> npm npm install chance spm It can also be used with spm. spm install chance  Usage Browser Chance instantiates itself onto the window. This means that in the simplest case you can just include the script tag then use an instance of Chance immediately. <script src=""chance.js""></script> <script>     console.log(chance.string()); </script> More info CLI Chance CLI has moved to its own project! Node.js And it can be used in Node.js. var Chance = require('chance'),     chance = new Chance();  // Get a random zip code chance.zip(); RequireJS Chance also includes an AMD define so it can be used with RequireJS. require(['Chance'], function(Chance) {     // Instantiate     var chance = new Chance();      // Then just use it:     var my_random_integer = chance.integer(); }); Dependent tools Chance CLI - Use Chance on the command line. Chance Token Replacer - Replace tokens in a string with Chance generated items. Dream.js - Lightweight json data generator Fake JSON Schema - Use chance generators to populate JSON Schema samples. Mocker Data Generator - Minimal JSON data generator. Know a library that uses Chance that isn't here? Update the README and submit a PR!

Obviously the following problem is preventable: 1 / 98 * 98 // = 0.9999999999999999 If you need more precision or just want a fraction as a result, have a look at Fraction.js: var Fraction = require('fraction.js');  Fraction(1).div(98).mul(98) // = 1 Internally, numbers are represented as numerator / denominator, which adds just a little overhead. However, the library is written with performance in mind and outperforms any other implementation, as you can see here. This basic data-type makes it the perfect basis for Polynomial.js and Math.js. Convert decimal to fraction The simplest job for fraction.js is to get a fraction out of a decimal: var x = new Fraction(1.88); var res = x.toFraction(true); // String ""1 22/25"" Examples / Motivation A simple example might be var f = new Fraction(""9.4'31'""); // 9.4313131313131... f.mul([-4, 3]).mod(""4.'8'""); // 4.88888888888888... The result is console.log(f.toFraction()); // -4154 / 1485 You could of course also access the sign (s), numerator (n) and denominator (d) on your own: f.s * f.n / f.d = -1 * 4154 / 1485 = -2.797306... If you would try to calculate it yourself, you would come up with something like: (9.4313131 * (-4 / 3)) % 4.888888 = -2.797308133... Quite okay, but yea - not as accurate as it could be. Laplace Probability Simple example. What's the probability of throwing a 3, and 1 or 4, and 2 or 4 or 6 with a fair dice? P({3}): var p = new Fraction([3].length, 6).toString(); // 0.1(6) P({1, 4}): var p = new Fraction([1, 4].length, 6).toString(); // 0.(3) P({2, 4, 6}): var p = new Fraction([2, 4, 6].length, 6).toString(); // 0.5 Convert degrees/minutes/seconds to precise rational representation: 57+45/60+17/3600 var deg = 57; // 57° var min = 45; // 45 Minutes var sec = 17; // 17 Seconds  new Fraction(deg).add(min, 60).add(sec, 3600).toString() // -> 57.7547(2) Rational approximation of irrational numbers Now it's getting messy ;d To approximate a number like sqrt(5) - 2 with a numerator and denominator, you can reformat the equation as follows: pow(n / d + 2, 2) = 5. Then the following algorithm will generate the rational number besides the binary representation. var x = ""/"", s = """";  var a = new Fraction(0),     b = new Fraction(1); for (var n = 0; n <= 10; n++) {      var c = new Fraction(a).add(b).div(2);      console.log(n + ""\t"" + a.n + ""/"" + a.d + ""\t"" + b.n + ""/"" + b.d + ""\t"" + c.n + ""/"" + c.d + ""\t"" + x);      if (c.add(2).pow(2) < 5) {         a = c;         x = ""1"";     } else {         b = c;         x = ""0"";     }     s+= x; } console.log(s) The result is n   a[n]        b[n]        c[n]            x[n] 0   0/1         1/1         1/2             / 1   0/1         1/2         1/4             0 2   0/1         1/4         1/8             0 3   1/8         1/4         3/16            1 4   3/16        1/4         7/32            1 5   7/32        1/4         15/64           1 6   15/64       1/4         31/128          1 7   15/64       31/128      61/256          0 8   15/64       61/256      121/512         0 9   15/64       121/512     241/1024        0 10  241/1024    121/512     483/2048        1  Thus the approximation after 11 iterations of the bisection method is 483 / 2048 and the binary representation is 0.00111100011 (see WolframAlpha) I published another example on how to approximate PI with fraction.js on my blog (Still not the best idea to approximate irrational numbers, but it illustrates the capabilities of Fraction.js perfectly). Get the exact fractional part of a number var f = new Fraction(""-6.(3416)""); console.log("""" + f.mod(1).abs()); // Same as: Math.abs(f - parseInt(f, 10)); Mathematical correct modulo The behaviour on negative congruences is different to most modulo implementations in computer science. Even the mod() function of Fraction.js behaves in the typical way. To solve the problem of having the mathematical correct modulo with Fraction.js you could come up with this: var a = -1; var b = 10.99;  console.log(new Fraction(a)      .mod(b)); // Not correct, usual Modulo  console.log(new Fraction(a)      .mod(b).add(b).mod(b)); // Correct! Mathematical Modulo fmod() impreciseness circumvented It turns out that Fraction.js outperforms almost any fmod() implementation, including JavaScript itself, php.js, C++, Python, Java and even Wolframalpha due to the fact that numbers like 0.05, 0.1, ... are infinite decimal in base 2. The equation fmod(4.55, 0.05) gives 0.04999999999999957, wolframalpha says 1/20. The correct answer should be zero, as 0.05 divides 4.55 without any remainder. Parser Any function (see below) as well as the constructor of the Fraction class parses its input and reduce it to the smallest term. You can pass either Arrays, Objects, Integers, Doubles or Strings. Arrays / Objects new Fraction(numerator, denominator); new Fraction([numerator, denominator]); new Fraction({n: numerator, d: denominator}); Integers new Fraction(123); Doubles new Fraction(55.4); Note: If you pass a double as it is, Fraction.js will perform a number analysis based on Farey Sequences. If you concern performance, cache Fraction.js objects and pass arrays/objects. The method is really precise, but too large exact numbers, like 1234567.9991829 will result in a wrong approximation. If you want to keep the number as it is, convert it to a string, as the string parser will not perform any further observations. If you have problems with the approximation, in the file examples/approx.js is a different approximation algorithm, which might work better in some more specific use-cases. Strings new Fraction(""123.45""); new Fraction(""123/45""); // A rational number represented as two decimals, separated by a slash new Fraction(""123:45""); // A rational number represented as two decimals, separated by a colon new Fraction(""4 123/45""); // A rational number represented as a whole number and a fraction new Fraction(""123.'456'""); // Note the quotes, see below! new Fraction(""123.(456)""); // Note the brackets, see below! new Fraction(""123.45'6'""); // Note the quotes, see below! new Fraction(""123.45(6)""); // Note the brackets, see below! Two arguments new Fraction(3, 2); // 3/2 = 1.5 Repeating decimal places Fraction.js can easily handle repeating decimal places. For example 1/3 is 0.3333.... There is only one repeating digit. As you can see in the examples above, you can pass a number like 1/3 as ""0.'3'"" or ""0.(3)"", which are synonym. There are no tests to parse something like 0.166666666 to 1/6! If you really want to handle this number, wrap around brackets on your own with the function below for example: 0.1(66666666) Assume you want to divide 123.32 / 33.6(567). WolframAlpha states that you'll get a period of 1776 digits. Fraction.js comes to the same result. Give it a try: var f = new Fraction(""123.32""); console.log(""Bam: "" + f.div(""33.6(567)"")); To automatically make a number like ""0.123123123"" to something more Fraction.js friendly like ""0.(123)"", I hacked this little brute force algorithm in a 10 minutes. Improvements are welcome... function formatDecimal(str) {      var comma, pre, offset, pad, times, repeat;      if (-1 === (comma = str.indexOf(""."")))         return str;      pre = str.substr(0, comma + 1);     str = str.substr(comma + 1);      for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {          offset = str.substr(0, i);          for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {              pad = str.substr(i, j + 1);              times = Math.ceil((str.length - offset.length) / pad.length);              repeat = new Array(times + 1).join(pad); // Silly String.repeat hack              if (0 === (offset + repeat).indexOf(str)) {                 return pre + offset + ""("" + pad + "")"";             }         }     }     return null; }  var f, x = formatDecimal(""13.0123123123""); // = 13.0(123) if (x !== null) {    f = new Fraction(x); } Attributes The Fraction object allows direct access to the numerator, denominator and sign attributes. It is ensured that only the sign-attribute holds sign information so that a sign comparision is only necessary against this attribute. var f = new Fraction('-1/2'); console.log(f.n); // Numerator: 1 console.log(f.d); // Denominator: 2 console.log(f.s); // Sign: -1 Functions Fraction abs() Returns the actual number without any sign information Fraction neg() Returns the actual number with flipped sign in order to get the additive inverse Fraction add(n) Returns the sum of the actual number and the parameter n Fraction sub(n) Returns the difference of the actual number and the parameter n Fraction mul(n) Returns the product of the actual number and the parameter n Fraction div(n) Returns the quotient of the actual number and the parameter n Fraction pow(exp) Returns the power of the actual number, raised to an integer exponent. Note: Rational exponents are planned, but would slow down the function a lot, because of a kinda slow root finding algorithm, whether the result will become irrational. So for now, only integer exponents are implemented. Fraction mod(n) Returns the modulus (rest of the division) of the actual object and n (this % n). It's a much more precise fmod() if you will. Please note that mod() is just like the modulo operator of most programming languages. If you want a mathematical correct modulo, see here. Fraction mod() Returns the modulus (rest of the division) of the actual object (numerator mod denominator) Fraction gcd(n) Returns the fractional greatest common divisor Fraction lcm(n) Returns the fractional least common multiple Fraction ceil([places=0]) Returns the ceiling of a rational number (rounded up) Fraction floor([places=0]) Returns the floor of a rational number (rounded down) Fraction round([places=0]) Returns the rational number rounded (normal round) Fraction inverse() Returns the multiplicative inverse of the actual number (n / d becomes d / n) in order to get the reciprocal boolean equals(n) Check if two numbers are equal boolean compare(n) Compare two numbers. result < 0: n is greater than actual number result > 0: n is smaller than actual number result = 0: n is equal to the actual number  boolean divisible(n) Check if two numbers are divisible (n divides this) double valueOf() Returns a decimal representation of the fraction String toString() Generates an exact string representation of the actual object, including repeating decimal places of any length. Note: As valueOf() and toString() are provided, toString() is only called implicitly in a real string context. Using the plus-operator like ""123"" + new Fraction will call valueOf(), because JavaScript tries to combine two primitives first and concatenates them later, as string will be the more dominant type. alert(new Fraction) or String(new Fraction) on the other hand will do what you expect. If you really want to have control, you should call toString() or valueOf() explicitly! String toLatex(excludeWhole=false) Generates an exact LaTeX representation of the actual object. You can see a live demo on my blog. The optional boolean parameter indicates if you want to exclude the whole part. ""1 1/3"" instead of ""4/3"" String toFraction(excludeWhole=false) Gets a string representation of the fraction The optional boolean parameter indicates if you want to exclude the whole part. ""1 1/3"" instead of ""4/3"" Array toContinued() Gets an array of the fraction represented as a continued fraction. The first element always contains the whole part. var f = new Fraction('88/33'); var c = f.toContinued(); // [2, 1, 2] Fraction clone() Creates a copy of the actual Fraction object Options The library should work without configuring anything. However, there is one global option: Fraction.REDUCE = <true|false> It tells Fraction.js whether to reduce the fraction or not. // Normal behavior var f = Fraction(3, 6); console.log(f); // 1/2  // Disable fraction reduction Fraction.REDUCE = false; var g = Fraction(3, 6); console.log(g); // 3/6  // Back to normal behavior Fraction.REDUCE = true; var h = Fraction(g); console.log(h); // 1/2 Exceptions If a really hard error occurs (parsing error, division by zero), fraction.js throws exceptions! Please make sure you handle them correctly. Installation Installing fraction.js is as easy as cloning this repo or use one of the following commands: bower install fraction.js  or npm install --save fraction.js  Using Fraction.js with the browser <script src=""fraction.js""></script> <script>     console.log(Fraction(""123/456"")); </script> Using Fraction.js with require.js <script src=""require.js""></script> <script> requirejs(['fraction.js'], function(Fraction) {     console.log(Fraction(""123/456"")); }); </script> Coding Style As every library I publish, fraction.js is also built to be as small as possible after compressing it with Google Closure Compiler in advanced mode. Thus the coding style orientates a little on maxing-out the compression rate. Please make sure you keep this style if you plan to extend the library. Precision Fraction.js tries to circumvent floating point errors, by having an internal representation of numerator and denominator. As it relies on JavaScript, there is also a limit. The biggest number representable is |Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER / 1| and the smallest is |1 / Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER|, with Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER=9007199254740991. Testing If you plan to enhance the library, make sure you add test cases and all the previous tests are passing. You can test the library with npm test  Copyright and licensing Copyright (c) 2015, Robert Eisele (robert@xarg.org) Dual licensed under the MIT or GPL Version 2 licenses.

It implements every elementary complex number manipulation function and the API is intentionally similar to Fraction.js. Furthermore, it's the basis of Polynomial.js and Math.js. Example var Complex = require('complex.js');  var c = new Complex(""99.3+8i""); c.mul({re: 3, im: 9}).div(4.9).sub(3, 2); Parser Any function (see below) as well as the constructor of the Complex class parses its input like this. You can pass either Objects, Doubles or Strings. Objects new Complex({re: real, im: imaginary}); new Complex({arg: angle, abs: radius}); new Complex({phi: angle, r: radius}); If there are other attributes on the passed object, they're not getting preserved and have to be merged manually. Doubles new Complex(55.4); Strings new Complex(""123.45""); new Complex(""15+3i""); new Complex(""i""); Two arguments new Complex(3, 2); // 3+2i Functions Complex sign() Returns the complex sign, defined as the complex number normalized by it's absolute value Complex add(n) Adds another complex number Complex sub(n) Subtracts another complex number Complex mul(n) Multiplies the number with another complex number Complex div(n) Divides the number by another complex number Complex pow(exp) Returns the number raised to the complex exponent Complex sqrt() Returns the complex square root of the number Complex exp(n) Returns e^n with complex exponent n. Complex log() Returns the natural logarithm (base E) of the actual complex number Note: The logarithm to a different base can be calculated with z.log().div(Math.log(base)). double abs() Calculates the magnitude of the complex number double arg() Calculates the angle of the complex number Complex inverse() Calculates the multiplicative inverse of the complex number (1 / z) Complex conjugate() Calculates the conjugate of the complex number (multiplies the imaginary part with -1) Complex neg() Negates the number (multiplies both the real and imaginary part with -1) in order to get the additive inverse Complex floor([places=0]) Floors the complex number parts towards zero Complex ceil([places=0]) Ceils the complex number parts off zero Complex round([places=0]) Rounds the complex number parts boolean equals(n) Checks if both numbers are exactly the same boolean isNaN() Checks if the given number is not a number Complex clone() Returns a new Complex instance with the same real and imaginary properties Array toVector() Returns a Vector of the actual complex number with two components String toString() Returns a string representation of the actual number. As of v1.9.0 the output is a bit more human readable new Complex(1, 2).toString(); // 1 + 2i new Complex(0, 1).toString(); // i new Complex(9, 0).toString(); // 9 new Complex(1, 1).toString(); // 1 + i double valueOf() Returns the real part of the number if imaginary part is zero. Otherwise null Trigonometric functions The following trigonometric functions are defined on Complex.js: Trig Arcus Hyperbolic Arcus-Hyperbolic sin() asin() sinh() asinh() cos() acos() cosh() acosh() tan() atan() tanh() atanh() cot() acot() coth() acoth() sec()  asec() sech() asech() csc() acsc() csch() acsch() Geometric Equivalence Complex numbers can also be seen as a vector in the 2D space. Here is a simple overview of basic operations and how to implement them with complex.js: New vector var v1 = Complex(1, 0); var v2 = Complex(1, 1); Scale vector scale(v1, factor):= v1.mul(factor) Translate vector translate(v1, v2):= v1.add(v2) Rotate vector around center rotate(v, angle):= v.mul({abs: 1, arg: angle}) Rotate vector around another vector rotate(v, p, angle):= v.sub(p).mul({abs: 1, arg: angle}).add(p) Distance to another vector distance(v1, v2):= v1.sub(v2).abs() Constants Complex.ZERO A complex zero instance Complex.ONE A complex one instance Complex.I An imaginary number i instance Complex.PI A complex PI instance Complex.E A complex euler number instance Complex.EPSILON A small epsilon value used for equal() comparison in order to circumvent double inprecision. Installation Installing complex.js is as easy as cloning this repo or use one of the following commands: bower install complex.js or npm install --save complex.js Using Complex.js with the browser <script src=""complex.js""></script> <script>     console.log(Complex(""4+3i"")); </script> Using Complex.js with require.js <script src=""require.js""></script> <script> requirejs(['complex.js'], function(Complex) {     console.log(Complex(""4+3i"")); }); </script> Coding Style As every library I publish, complex.js is also built to be as small as possible after compressing it with Google Closure Compiler in advanced mode. Thus the coding style orientates a little on maxing-out the compression rate. Please make sure you keep this style if you plan to extend the library. Testing If you plan to enhance the library, make sure you add test cases and all the previous tests are passing.

Polynomial mod(n) Returns the modulus (rest of the division) of the actual polynomial and n (this % n). Polynomial gcd(n) Returns the greatest common divisor of two polynomials Number degree() Returns the degree of the polynomial String toString() Generates a string representation of the actual polynomial.

No flash to slow down your page load. No cookies to fatten your network requests. store.js depends on JSON for serialization to disk. Installation Just grab store.min.js or store+json2.min.js and include them with a script tag. store.enabled flag If your product depends on store.js, you must check the store.enabled flag first: <script src=""store.min.js""></script> <script>     init()     function init() {         if (!store.enabled) {             alert('Local storage is not supported by your browser. Please disable ""Private Mode"", or upgrade to a modern browser.')             return         }         var user = store.get('user')         // ... and so on ...     } </script> LocalStorage may sometimes appear to be available but throw an error when used. An example is Safari's private browsing mode. Other browsers allow the user to temporarily disable localStorage. Store.js detects these conditions and sets the store.enabled flag appropriately. Screencast Introductory Screencast to Store.js by Jack Franklin. Contributors & Forks Contributors: https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/graphs/contributors Forks: https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/network/members In node.js store.js works as expected in node.js, assuming that global.localStorage has been set: global.localStorage = require('localStorage') var store = require('./store') store.set('foo', 1) console.log(store.get('foo'))  Supported browsers Tested in iOS 4+ Tested in Firefox 3.5 Tested in Firefox 3.6 Tested in Firefox 4.0+ Support dropped for Firefox < 3.5 (see notes below) Tested in Chrome 5 Tested in Chrome 6 Tested in Chrome 7 Tested in Chrome 8 Tested in Chrome 10 Tested in Chrome 11+ Tested in Safari 4 Tested in Safari 5 Tested in IE6 Tested in IE7 Tested in IE8 Tested in IE9 Tested in IE10 Tested in Opera 10 Tested in Opera 11 Tested in Opera 12 Tested in Node.js v0.10.4 (with https://github.com/coolaj86/node-localStorage 1.0.2) Private mode Store.js may not work while browsing in private mode. This is as it should be. Check the store.enabled flag before relying on store.js. Saucelabs.com rocks Extensive browser testing of store.js is possible thanks to Saucelabs.com. Check them out, they're awesome. Firefox 3.0 & 2.0: Support for FF 2 & 3 was dropped in v1.3.6. If you require support for ancient versions of FF, use v1.3.5 of store.js. Important note: In IE6 and IE7, many special characters are not allowed in the keys used to store any key/value pair. With @mferretti's help, there's a suitable workaround which replaces most forbidden characters with ""___"". Storage limits IE6 & IE7: 1MB total, but 128kb per ""path"" or ""document"" (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531424(v=vs.85).aspx) See http://dev-test.nemikor.com/web-storage/support-test/ for a list of limits per browser Unsupported browsers Firefox 1.0: no means (beside cookies and flash) Safari 2: no means (beside cookies and flash) Safari 3: no synchronous api (has asynch sqlite api, but store.js is synch) Opera 9: don't know if there is synchronous api for storing data locally Firefox 1.5: don't know if there is synchronous api for storing data locally Microsoft IIS & IE7: With meta tag & ""charset=iso-8859-1"", things stop working. See issue #47. Some notes on serialization localStorage, when used without store.js, calls toString on all stored values. This means that you can't conveniently store and retrieve numbers, objects or arrays: localStorage.myage = 24 localStorage.myage !== 24 localStorage.myage === '24'  localStorage.user = { name: 'marcus', likes: 'javascript' } localStorage.user === ""[object Object]""  localStorage.tags = ['javascript', 'localStorage', 'store.js'] localStorage.tags.length === 32 localStorage.tags === ""javascript,localStorage,store.js"" What we want (and get with store.js) is store.set('myage', 24) store.get('myage') === 24  store.set('user', { name: 'marcus', likes: 'javascript' }) alert(""Hi my name is "" + store.get('user').name + ""!"")  store.set('tags', ['javascript', 'localStorage', 'store.js']) alert(""We've got "" + store.get('tags').length + "" tags here"") The native serialization engine of javascript is JSON. Rather than leaving it up to you to serialize and deserialize your values, store.js uses JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() on each call to store.set() and store.get(), respectively. Some browsers do not have native support for JSON. For those browsers you should include JSON2.js (non-minified copy is included in this repo). No sessionStorage/auto-expiration? No. I believe there is no way to provide sessionStorage semantics cross browser. However, it is trivial to expire values on read on top of store.js: var storeWithExpiration = {     set: function(key, val, exp) {         store.set(key, { val:val, exp:exp, time:new Date().getTime() })     },     get: function(key) {         var info = store.get(key)         if (!info) { return null }         if (new Date().getTime() - info.time > info.exp) { return null }         return info.val     } } storeWithExpiration.set('foo', 'bar', 1000) setTimeout(function() { console.log(storeWithExpiration.get('foo')) }, 500) // -> ""bar"" setTimeout(function() { console.log(storeWithExpiration.get('foo')) }, 1500) // -> null Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

See the wiki for detailed compatibility info. To use localForage, just drop a single JavaScript file into your page: <script src=""localforage.js""></script> <script>localforage.getItem('something', myCallback);</script> Download the latest localForage from GitHub, or install with npm: npm install localforage or bower: bower install localforage localForage is compatible with browserify. Support Lost? Need help? Try the localForage API documentation. If you're stuck using the library, running the tests, or want to contribute to localForage, you can visit irc.freenode.net and head to the #localforage channel to ask questions about localForage. The best person to ask about localForage is tofumatt, who is usually online from 8am-8pm GMT (London Time). How to use localForage Callbacks vs Promises Because localForage uses async storage, it has an async API. It's otherwise exactly the same as the localStorage API. localForage has a dual API that allows you to either use Node-style callbacks or Promises. If you are unsure which one is right for you, it's recommended to use Promises. Here's an example of the Node-style callback form: localforage.setItem('key', 'value', function (err) {   // if err is non-null, we got an error   localforage.getItem('key', function (err, value) {     // if err is non-null, we got an error. otherwise, value is the value    }); }); And the Promise form: localforage.setItem('key', 'value').then(function () {   return localforage.getItem('key'); }).then(function (value) {   // we got our value }).catch(function (err) {   // we got an error }); For more examples, please visit the API docs. Storing Blobs, TypedArrays, and other JS objects You can store any type in localForage; you aren't limited to strings like in localStorage. Even if localStorage is your storage backend, localForage automatically does JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() when getting/setting values. localForage supports storing all native JS objects that can be serialized to JSON, as well as ArrayBuffers, Blobs, and TypedArrays. Check the API docs for a full list of types supported by localForage. All types are supported in every storage backend, though storage limits in localStorage make storing many large Blobs impossible. Configuration You can set database information with the config() method. Available options are driver, name, storeName, version, size, and description. Example: localforage.config({     driver      : localforage.WEBSQL, // Force WebSQL; same as using setDriver()     name        : 'myApp',     version     : 1.0,     size        : 4980736, // Size of database, in bytes. WebSQL-only for now.     storeName   : 'keyvaluepairs', // Should be alphanumeric, with underscores.     description : 'some description' }); Note: you must call config() before you interact with your data. This means calling config() before using getItem(), setItem(), removeItem(), clear(), key(), keys() or length(). Multiple instances You can create multiple instances of localForage that point to different stores using createInstance. All the configuration options used by config are supported. var store = localforage.createInstance({   name: ""nameHere"" });  var otherStore = localforage.createInstance({   name: ""otherName"" });  // Setting the key on one of these doesn't affect the other. store.setItem(""key"", ""value""); otherStore.setItem(""key"", ""value2""); RequireJS You can use localForage with RequireJS: define(['localforage'], function(localforage) {     // As a callback:     localforage.setItem('mykey', 'myvalue', console.log);      // With a Promise:     localforage.setItem('mykey', 'myvalue').then(console.log); }); Browserify and Webpack localForage 1.3+ works with both Browserify and Webpack. If you're using an earlier version of localForage and are having issues with Browserify or Webpack, please upgrade to 1.3.0 or above. If you're using localForage in your own build system (eg. browserify or webpack) make sure you have the required plugins and transformers installed (eg. npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-system-import-transformer). TypeScript To import localForage in TypeScript: const localForage:LocalForage = require(""localforage""); Note that the ES6 style import is not supported for our module type. Check out the following to know why: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29596714/new-es6-syntax-for-importing-commonjs-amd-modules-i-e-import-foo-require http://www.jbrantly.com/es6-modules-with-typescript-and-webpack/ Framework Support If you use a framework listed, there's a localForage storage driver for the models in your framework so you can store data offline with localForage. We have drivers for the following frameworks: AngularJS Backbone Ember If you have a driver you'd like listed, please open an issue to have it added to this list. Custom Drivers You can create your own driver if you want; see the defineDriver API docs. There is a list of custom drivers on the wiki. Working on localForage You'll need node/npm and bower. To work on localForage, you should start by forking it and installing its dependencies. Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username and run the following: # Install bower globally if you don't have it: npm install -g bower  # Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username: git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/localForage.git cd localForage npm install bower install Omitting the bower dependencies will cause the tests to fail! Running Tests You need PhantomJS installed to run local tests. Run npm test (or, directly: grunt test). Your code must also pass the linter. localForage is designed to run in the browser, so the tests explicitly require a browser environment. Local tests are run on a headless WebKit (using PhantomJS). When you submit a pull request, tests will be run against all browsers that localForage supports on Travis CI using Sauce Labs.

This project is in a frozen state. No more API changes. Pull requests for bug fixes are welcomed, anything else gets most probably ignored. A bug is something that breaks the application, outdated package file is not a bug. jStorage jStorage is a cross-browser key-value store database to store data locally in the browser - jStorage supports all major browsers, both in desktop (yes - even Internet Explorer 6) and in mobile. Additionally jStorage is library agnostic, it works well with any other JavaScript library on the same webpage, be it jQuery, Prototype, MooTools or something else. Though you still need to have either a third party library (Prototype, MooTools) or JSON2 on the page to support older IE versions. jStorage supports storing Strings, Numbers, JavaScript objects, Arrays and even native XML nodes which kind of makes it a JSON storage. jStorage also supports setting TTL values for auto expiring stored keys and - best of all - notifying other tabs/windows when a key has been changed, which makes jStorage also a local PubSub platform for web applications. jStorage is pretty small, about 7kB when minified, 3kB gzipped. Function reference set(key, value[, options]) $.jStorage.set(key, value, options) Saves a value to local storage. key needs to be string otherwise an exception is thrown. value can be any JSONeable value, including objects and arrays or a XML node. Currently XML nodes can't be nested inside other objects: $.jStorage.set(""xml"", xml_node) is OK but $.jStorage.set(""xml"", {xml: xml_node}) is not. Options is an optional options object. Currently only available option is options.TTL which can be used to set the TTL value to the key $.jStorage.set(key, value, {TTL: 1000}). NB - if no TTL option value has been set, any currently used TTL value for the key will be removed. get(key[, default]) value = $.jStorage.get(key) value = $.jStorage.get(key, ""default value"") get retrieves the value if key exists, or default if it doesn't. key needs to be string otherwise an exception is thrown. default can be any value. deleteKey(key) $.jStorage.deleteKey(key) Removes a key from the storage. key needs to be string otherwise an exception is thrown. setTTL(key, ttl) $.jStorage.set(""mykey"", ""keyvalue""); $.jStorage.setTTL(""mykey"", 3000); // expires in 3 seconds Sets a TTL (in milliseconds) for an existing key. Use 0 or negative value to clear TTL. getTTL(key) ttl = $.jStorage.getTTL(""mykey""); // TTL in milliseconds or 0 Gets remaining TTL (in milliseconds) for a key or 0 if not TTL has been set. flush() $.jStorage.flush() Clears the cache. index() $.jStorage.index() Returns all the keys currently in use as an array. var index = $.jStorage.index(); console.log(index); // [""key1"",""key2"",""key3""] storageSize() $.jStorage.storageSize() Returns the size of the stored data in bytes currentBackend() $.jStorage.currentBackend() Returns the storage engine currently in use or false if none reInit() $.jStorage.reInit() Reloads the data from browser storage storageAvailable() $.jStorage.storageAvailable() Returns true if storage is available subscribe(channel, callback) $.jStorage.subscribe(""ch1"", function(channel, payload){     console.log(payload+ "" from "" + channel); }); Subscribes to a Publish/Subscribe channel (see demo) publish(channel, payload) $.jStorage.publish(""ch1"", ""data""); Publishes payload to a Publish/Subscribe channel (see demo) listenKeyChange(key, callback) $.jStorage.listenKeyChange(""mykey"", function(key, action){     console.log(key + "" has been "" + action); }); Listens for updates for selected key. NB! even updates made in other windows/tabs are reflected, so this feature can also be used for some kind of publish/subscribe service. If you want to listen for any key change, use ""*"" as the key name $.jStorage.listenKeyChange(""*"", function(key, action){     console.log(key + "" has been "" + action); }); stopListening(key[, callback]) $.jStorage.stopListening(""mykey""); // cancel all listeners for ""mykey"" change Stops listening for key change. If callback is set, only the used callback will be cleared, otherwise all listeners will be dropped. Donate Support jStorage development Features jStorage supports the following features: store and retrieve data from browser storage using any JSON compatible data format (+ native XML nodes) set TTL values to stored keys for auto expiring publish and subscribe to cross-window/tab events listen for key changes (update, delete) from the current or any other browser window use any browser since IE6, both in desktop and in mobile Browser support Current availability: jStorage supports all major browsers - Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 2+, Safari 4+, Chrome 4+, Opera 10.50+ If the browser doesn't support data caching, then no exceptions are raised - jStorage can still be used by the script but nothing is actually stored.

Enables multiple browser windows/tabs, across a variety of domains, to share a single localStorage. Features an API using ES6 promises. Overview Installation API CrossStorageHub.init(permissions) new CrossStorageClient(url, [opts]) CrossStorageClient.prototype.onConnect() CrossStorageClient.prototype.set(key, value, [ttl]) CrossStorageClient.prototype.get(key1, [key2], [...]) CrossStorageClient.prototype.del(key1, [key2], [...]) CrossStorageClient.prototype.getKeys() CrossStorageClient.prototype.clear() CrossStorageClient.prototype.close() Compatibility Compression Building Tests Copyright and license Overview The library is a convenient alternative to sharing a root domain cookie. Unlike cookies, your client-side data isn't limited to a few kilobytes - you get up to 2.49M chars. For a client-heavy application, you can potentially shave a few KB off your request headers by avoiding cookies. This is all thanks to LocalStorage, which is available in IE 8+, FF 3.5+, Chrome 4+, as well as a majority of mobile browsers. For a list of compatible browsers, refer to caniuse. How does it work? The library is divided into two types of components: hubs and clients. The hubs reside on a host of choice and interact directly with the LocalStorage API. The clients then load said hub over an embedded iframe and post messages, requesting data to be stored, retrieved, and deleted. This allows multiple clients to access and share the data located in a single store. Care should be made to limit the origins of the bidirectional communication. As such, when initializing the hub, an array of permissions objects is passed. Any messages from clients whose origin does not match the pattern are ignored, as well as those not within the allowed set of methods. The set of permissions are enforced thanks to the same-origin policy. However, keep in mind that any user has full control of their local storage data - it's still client data. This only restricts access on a per-domain or web app level. Hub // Config s.t. subdomains can get, but only the root domain can set and del CrossStorageHub.init([   {origin: /\.example.com$/,            allow: ['get']},   {origin: /:\/\/(www\.)?example.com$/, allow: ['get', 'set', 'del']} ]); Note the $ for matching the end of the string. The RegExps in the above example will match origins such as valid.example.com, but not invalid.example.com.malicious.com. Client var storage = new CrossStorageClient('https://store.example.com/hub.html');  storage.onConnect().then(function() {   // Set a key with a TTL of 90 seconds   return storage.set('newKey', 'foobar', 90000); }).then(function() {   return storage.get('existingKey', 'newKey'); }).then(function(res) {   console.log(res.length); // 2 }).catch(function(err) {   // Handle error }); Installation The library can be installed via bower: bower install cross-storage Or using npm: npm install cross-storage along with browserify: var CrossStorageClient = require('cross-storage').CrossStorageClient; var CrossStorageHub    = require('cross-storage').CrossStorageHub; When serving the hub, you may want to set the CORS and CSP headers for your server depending on client/hub location. For example: {   'Access-Control-Allow-Origin':  '*',   'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE',   'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'X-Requested-With',   'Content-Security-Policy':      ""default-src 'unsafe-inline' *"",   'X-Content-Security-Policy':    ""default-src 'unsafe-inline' *"",   'X-WebKit-CSP':                 ""default-src 'unsafe-inline' *"", } If using inline JS to create the hub, you'll need to specify unsafe-inline for the CSP headers. Otherwise, it can be left out if simply including the init code via another resource. API CrossStorageHub.init(permissions) Accepts an array of objects with two keys: origin and allow. The value of origin is expected to be a RegExp, and allow, an array of strings. The cross storage hub is then initialized to accept requests from any of the matching origins, allowing access to the associated lists of methods. Methods may include any of: get, set, del, getKeys and clear. A 'ready' message is sent to the parent window once complete. CrossStorageHub.init([   {origin: /localhost:3000$/, allow: ['get', 'set', 'del', 'getKeys', 'clear']} ]); new CrossStorageClient(url, [opts]) Constructs a new cross storage client given the url to a hub. By default, an iframe is created within the document body that points to the url. It also accepts an options object, which may include a timeout, frameId, and promise. The timeout, in milliseconds, is applied to each request and defaults to 5000ms. The options object may also include a frameId, identifying an existing frame on which to install its listeners. If the promise key is supplied the constructor for a Promise, that Promise library will be used instead of the default window.Promise. var storage = new CrossStorageClient('http://localhost:3000/hub.html');  var storage = new CrossStorageClient('http://localhost:3000/hub.html', {   timeout: 5000,   frameId: 'storageFrame' }); CrossStorageClient.prototype.onConnect() Returns a promise that is fulfilled when a connection has been established with the cross storage hub. Its use is required to avoid sending any requests prior to initialization being complete. storage.onConnect().then(function() {   // ready! }); CrossStorageClient.prototype.set(key, value, [ttl]) Sets a key to the specified value, optionally accepting a ttl to passively expire the key after a number of milliseconds. Returns a promise that is fulfilled on success, or rejected if any errors setting the key occurred, or the request timed out. storage.onConnect().then(function() {   return storage.set('key', {foo: 'bar'}); }).then(function() {   return storage.set('expiringKey', 'foobar', 10000); }); CrossStorageClient.prototype.get(key1, [key2], [...]) Accepts one or more keys for which to retrieve their values. Returns a promise that is settled on hub response or timeout. On success, it is fulfilled with the value of the key if only passed a single argument. Otherwise it's resolved with an array of values. On failure, it is rejected with the corresponding error message. storage.onConnect().then(function() {   return storage.get('key1'); }).then(function(res) {   return storage.get('key1', 'key2', 'key3'); }).then(function(res) {   // ... }); CrossStorageClient.prototype.del(key1, [key2], [...]) Accepts one or more keys for deletion. Returns a promise that is settled on hub response or timeout. storage.onConnect().then(function() {   return storage.del('key1', 'key2'); }); CrossStorageClient.prototype.getKeys() Returns a promise that, when resolved, passes an array of keys currently in storage. storage.onConnect().then(function() {   return storage.getKeys(); }).then(function(keys) {   // ['key1', 'key2', ...] }); CrossStorageClient.prototype.clear() Returns a promise that, when resolved, indicates that all localStorage data has been cleared. storage.onConnect().then(function() {   return storage.clear(); }); CrossStorageClient.prototype.close() Deletes the iframe and sets the connected state to false. The client can no longer be used after being invoked. storage.onConnect().then(function() {   return storage.set('key1', 'key2'); }).catch(function(err) {   // Handle error }).then(function() {   storage.close(); }); Compatibility For compatibility with older browsers, simply load a Promise polyfill such as es6-promise. <script src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/es6-promises/promise-1.0.0.min.js""></script> You can also use RSVP or any other ES6 compliant promise library. Supports IE8 and up using the above polyfill. A JSON polyfill is also required for IE8 in Compatibility View. Also note that catch is a reserved word in IE8, and so error handling with promises can be done as: storage.onConnect().then(function() {   return storage.get('key1'); }).then(function(res) {   // ... on success })['catch'](function(err) {   // ... on error }); Notes on Safari 7+ (OSX, iOS) All cross-domain local storage access is disabled by default with Safari 7+. This is a result of the ""Block cookies and other website data"" privacy setting being set to ""From third parties and advertisers"". Any cross-storage client code will not crash, however, it will only have access to a sandboxed, isolated local storage instance. As such, none of the data previously set by other origins will be accessible. If an option, one could fall back to using root cookies for those user agents, or requesting the data from a server-side store. Compression Most localStorage-compatible browsers offer at least ~5Mb of storage. But keys and values are defined as DOMStrings, which are UTF-8 encoded using single 16-bit sequences. That means a string of ~2.5 million ASCII characters will use up ~5Mb, since they're 2 bytes per char. If you need to maximize your storage space, consider using lz-string. For smaller strings, it's not uncommon to see a 50% reduction in size when compressed, which will bring you a lot closer to 5 million characters. At that point, you're only limited by the average compression rate of your strings, as well as the minor overhead produced by the serialization format used by the library: JSON. Building The minified, production JavaScript can be generated with gulp by running gulp dist. If not already on your system, gulp can be installed using npm install -g gulp Tests Tests can be ran locally using npm test. Tests are ran using Zuul, and the Travis CI build uses Sauce Labs for multi-browser testing as well.

As the number of scripts add up, so does the number of HTTP requests. This leads to increased page load times and reduced performance. Basket.js is a project dedicated to aleviating this problem. Basket.js loads your site's scripts into a page and saves them in localStorage so they can be reused after the session until they are expired. It also checks to see if the scripts are already in localStorage, and if not, loads them. This prevents unneccessary reloading of scripts and can improve load time and website performance. Resources Examples Load RequireJS modules with Basket.js Loading CSS with Basket.js Articles Basket.js: A JavaScript Loader With LocalStorage-based script caching basket.js caches scripts with HTML5 localStorage Basket.js for improved script caching How to Improve Loading Time with basket.js Contribute Style Guide This project follows the Idiomatic guide to writing JavaScript - a concise extension to the jQuery Core Style guidelines, with the exception of multiple var statements. Please ensure any pull requests follow these closely. Unit Tests We are also attempting to get as much unit test coverage as possible. For this reason, please add unit tests for any new or changed functionality and remember to lint and test your code using grunt. Also, please don't edit files in the ""dist"" subdirectory as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the ""lib"" subdirectory! Building To build the project, you will first need to install the necessary dependencies (such as RSVP) using npm and Bower. Run: $ npm install & bower install in the project root to get everything you need. Next, to actually build the project you will need Grunt. Run: $ grunt release to generate a new release, otherwise just running grunt test will run the unit tests.

Consider it as alternative for other types of loaders for modern browsers, that reduce number of server requests, especially for mobile devices. Also bag.js can be used as simple key/value storage, that doesn't require you to know details about IndexedDB and WebSQL. This project is inspired by basket.js, but provides more safe storages for big assets and universal key/value interface. Key features are: Parallel load and sequential execution for JS / CSS and other types of files Use IndexedDB / WebSQL / localStorage - no size limits for big assets. KV storage for objects, with simple interface. Supports thenable + callbacks. You can use multiple instances with different storage options. For example Indexeddb + WebSQL for assets and localStorage for user settings. 4.1K when minified+gzipped, no extra dependencies. Partial compatibility with basket.js. Built-in simple thenable implementation for browsers without promises support. Install via bower: bower install bag.js Install via npm: bower install bagjs --save Examples Simple: var bag = new window.Bag();  bag.require(['/site.css', '/jquery.js', '/site.js'], function (err) {   if (err) {     console.log('loading error: ', err);     return   }   // code to run after loading   // ... })  Advanced: var bag = new window.Bag({   prefix: 'my_namespace',   stores: ['indexeddb', 'websql'],   timeout: 20000,   expire: 24 });  bag.isValidItem = function(source, obj) {   return (source && (source.url === obj.url)) ? true : false; };  var files = [   { url: '/site.css', expire: 1 },   { url: '/jquery.js', expire: 10 },   { url: '/site.js' },   { url: '/more_styles.css', expire: 5, execute: false } ];  bag.require(files)   .then(function(data) {     console.log('loaded', data);   })   .then(null, function (err) {     console.log(err);   }); }) You can skip new keyword. Also, you can use callbacks: window.Bag().require([ '/site.css', '/site.js'], function (err, data) {   if (err) {     console.log('loading error: ', err);     return;   }   console.log(data); }); Using as key/value storage: var obj = { lorem: 'ipsum' }; var bag = new window.Bag();  bag.set('dolorem', obj)   .then(function () {     return bag.get('dolorem');   })   .then(function (data) {     console.log('Loaded data:\n', data);   })   .catch(function (err) {     console.log(err);   })   .then(function () {     return bag.remove('dolorem');   }); API Note, all methods with optional callbacks will return promises if callback is not set. new Bag([options]) Object constructor. You can also define options after constructor call, via instance properties (they have the same names). Options (hash): prefix - Data namespace. Default - bag. Used to separate data for multiple instances. stores - Array of storage names to use, ordered by preference. Default ['indexeddb', 'websql', 'localstorage']. timeout - files loading timeout, in seconds. Default 20. expire - require() data expiration, in hours. Default - 1 month. 0 or unset - don't expire. Note 1: you can skip new keyword, calling Bag() will return you new instance anyway. Note 2: prefix must be set before require/get/set/remove/clear calls. Other options can be changed anytime. .require(files [, callback(err, data)]) Load files from server or from cache. Inject known types into page (js/css by default), unless execution is disabled. When multiple files requested (files are Array), those are loaded in parallel, but injected in defined order. Also, content of the files is returned in the result. files param can be: Object - resource info (see details below). String - just resource url, other params will be default. Array(Object|String) - list of resources to load in parallel. resource info: url - resource URI, required. expire - optional, expiration time in hours. 0 or not set - don't expire. key - the name, used to store loaded file, if not defined, then url will be used. unique - a token stored with the cached item. If you request the same item again with a different token the script will be fetched and cached again. live - force cache bypass, for development needs. cached - force request from cache only. callback params: err - error info if loading failed data - (Array|String) with loaded content, depending on files type. If a single resource is requested (Object|String), data is String. If an Array of resources is requested, or chained call done, data is array of strings. Note, unless you pass resources info in short form, input objects are extended with loaded data. .get(key [, callback(err, data)]) Load data by key name. Return result via callback: err - error info on fail, null on success data - loaded object, undefined if not exists. .set(key, data [, expire] [, callback(err)]) Put data into storage under key name. key - String to address data. data - JS object to store. We currently support only objects, serializable by JSON. Don't try to put functions or arraybuffers. expire - Expiration time in seconds. Don't expire by default. callback(err) - Function to call when complete. err contains error on fail. .remove(key [, callback(err)]) Remove key data from store. Call callback when complete. If error happens, error info passed in first callback's param. .clear([expiredOnly] [, callback(err)]) Clear all storage data (in your namespace), or just expired objects when called as bag.clear(true, ...). Callback is optional. .addHandler(types, handler) Add handler for loaded files with specified mime types. By default, handlers for application/javascript and text/css already exist. If you set execute: false in resource info, then handler will not be applied. types - String with mime type or Array of strings. handler - function to ""execute"" file of that type. .removeHandler(types) Remove handler for specified mime type (opposite to addHandler).

Updating the readme May 6, 2014 package.json Check third-party cookies May 19, 2016 README.md Basil.js The missing Javascript smart persistence layer. Unified localstorage, cookie and session storage JavaScript API. Philosophy Basil aims to ease the frontend storage management for developers. It strives to be bulletproof and handle disabled cookies, full localStorage and other unwanted native storage exceptions.. When you try to store something, basil will automatically look through all the available storage mechanisms and find the best suited one to store your value. It also handles storage of complex javascript objects using json. Basic Usage basil = new window.Basil(options);  // basic methods basil.set('foo', 'bar'); // store 'bar' value under 'foo' key basil.set('abc', 'xyz'); // store 'xyz' value under 'abc' key basil.get('foo'); // returns 'bar' basil.keys(); // returns ['abc', 'foo'] basil.keysMap(); // returns { 'abc': ['local'], 'foo': ['local'] } basil.remove('foo'); // remove 'foo' value  // advanced methods basil.check('local'); // boolean. Test if localStorage is available basil.reset(); // reset all stored values under namespace Advanced Usage Storages basil = new window.Basil(options);  // force storage on the go through basil // set 'bar' value under 'foo' key in localStorage basil.set('foo', 'bar', { 'storages': ['local'] });  // set 'bar' value under 'foo' key. // try first to store it into cookies and if not possible into localStorage basil.set('foo', 'quux', { 'storages': ['cookie', 'local'] });  // set 'xyz' value under 'abc' key in memory basil.set('abc', 'xyz', { 'storages': ['memory'] });  // set value without JSON encoding basil.set('foo', '{ ""bar"": ""baz"" }', { raw: true }); // will save { ""bar"": ""baz"" } as string  // retrieve keys basil.keys(); // returns ['foo', 'abc'] basil.keys({ 'storages': ['memory'] }); // returns ['abc']  // retrieve keys map basil.keysMap(); // returns { 'foo': ['local', 'cookie'], 'abc': ['memory'] } basil.keysMap({ 'storages': ['memory'] }); // returns { 'abc': ['memory'] } Native storages // Access native storages // With basil API, but without namespace nor JSON parsing for values  // cookies Basil.cookie.get(key); Basil.cookie.set(key, value, { 'expireDays': days, 'domain': 'mydomain.com', 'secure': true });  // localStorage Basil.localStorage.get(key); Basil.localStorage.set(key, value);  // sessionStorage Basil.sessionStorage.get(key); Basil.sessionStorage.set(key, value);  Namespaces basil = new window.Basil(options);  // store data under default namespace basil.set('hello', 'world');  // store data under a given namespace basil.set('hello', 42, { 'namespace': 'alt' }); basil.set('abc', 'def', { 'namespace': 'alt', 'storages': ['memory'] });  // retrieve data basil.get('hello'); // return 'world' basil.get('hello', { 'namespace': 'alt' }); // return 42  // retrieves keys basil.keys(); // returns ['hello'] basil.keys({ 'namespace': 'alt' }); // returns ['hello', 'abc']  // retrieves  keys map basil.keysMap(); // returns { 'hello': ['local'] } basil.keysMap({ 'namespace': 'alt' }); // returns { 'hello': ['local'], 'abc': ['memory'] }  // remove data under a given namespace basil.remove('hello', { 'namespace': 'alt' }); basil.get('hello'); // return 'world' basil.get('hello', { 'namespace': 'alt' }); // return null  // reset data under a given namespace basil.reset({ 'namespace': 'alt', 'storages': ['local', 'memory']}); Configuration Here is the whole options object that you could give to Basil: options = {   // Namespace. Namespace your Basil stored data   // default: 'b45i1'   namespace: 'foo',    // storages. Specify all Basil supported storages and priority order   // default: `['local', 'cookie', 'session', 'memory']`   storages: ['cookie', 'local']    // expireDays.

Build Status Matrix Installation Include script after the jQuery library (unless you are packaging scripts somehow else): <script src=""/path/to/jquery.cookie.js""></script> Do not include the script directly from GitHub (http://raw.github.com/...). The file is being served as text/plain and as such being blocked in Internet Explorer on Windows 7 for instance (because of the wrong MIME type). Bottom line: GitHub is not a CDN. The plugin can also be loaded as AMD or CommonJS module. Usage Create session cookie: $.cookie('name', 'value'); Create expiring cookie, 7 days from then: $.cookie('name', 'value', { expires: 7 }); Create expiring cookie, valid across entire site: $.cookie('name', 'value', { expires: 7, path: '/' }); Read cookie: $.cookie('name'); // => ""value"" $.cookie('nothing'); // => undefined Read all available cookies: $.cookie(); // => { ""name"": ""value"" } Delete cookie: // Returns true when cookie was successfully deleted, otherwise false $.removeCookie('name'); // => true $.removeCookie('nothing'); // => false  // Need to use the same attributes (path, domain) as what the cookie was written with $.cookie('name', 'value', { path: '/' }); // This won't work! $.removeCookie('name'); // => false // This will work! $.removeCookie('name', { path: '/' }); // => true Note: when deleting a cookie, you must pass the exact same path, domain and secure options that were used to set the cookie, unless you're relying on the default options that is. Configuration raw By default the cookie value is encoded/decoded when writing/reading, using encodeURIComponent/decodeURIComponent. Bypass this by setting raw to true: $.cookie.raw = true; json Turn on automatic storage of JSON objects passed as the cookie value. Assumes JSON.stringify and JSON.parse: $.cookie.json = true; Cookie Options Cookie attributes can be set globally by setting properties of the $.cookie.defaults object or individually for each call to $.cookie() by passing a plain object to the options argument. Per-call options override the default options. expires expires: 365  Define lifetime of the cookie. Value can be a Number which will be interpreted as days from time of creation or a Date object. If omitted, the cookie becomes a session cookie. path path: '/'  Define the path where the cookie is valid. By default the path of the cookie is the path of the page where the cookie was created (standard browser behavior). If you want to make it available for instance across the entire domain use path: '/'. Default: path of page where the cookie was created. Note regarding Internet Explorer: Due to an obscure bug in the underlying WinINET InternetGetCookie implementation, IE’s document.cookie will not return a cookie if it was set with a path attribute containing a filename. (From Internet Explorer Cookie Internals (FAQ)) This means one cannot set a path using path: window.location.pathname in case such pathname contains a filename like so: /check.html (or at least, such cookie cannot be read correctly). domain domain: 'example.com'  Define the domain where the cookie is valid. Default: domain of page where the cookie was created. secure secure: true  If true, the cookie transmission requires a secure protocol (https). Default: false. Converters Provide a conversion function as optional last argument for reading, in order to change the cookie's value to a different representation on the fly. Example for parsing a value into a number: $.cookie('foo', '42'); $.cookie('foo', Number); // => 42 Dealing with cookies that have been encoded using escape (3rd party cookies): $.cookie.raw = true; $.cookie('foo', unescape); You can pass an arbitrary conversion function.

Package Managers JavaScript Cookie supports npm and Bower under the name js-cookie. Module Loaders JavaScript Cookie can also be loaded as an AMD or CommonJS module. Basic Usage Create a cookie, valid across the entire site: Cookies.set('name', 'value'); Create a cookie that expires 7 days from now, valid across the entire site: Cookies.set('name', 'value', { expires: 7 }); Create an expiring cookie, valid to the path of the current page: Cookies.set('name', 'value', { expires: 7, path: '' }); Read cookie: Cookies.get('name'); // => 'value' Cookies.get('nothing'); // => undefined Read all visible cookies: Cookies.get(); // => { name: 'value' } Delete cookie: Cookies.remove('name'); Delete a cookie valid to the path of the current page: Cookies.set('name', 'value', { path: '' }); Cookies.remove('name'); // fail! Cookies.remove('name', { path: '' }); // removed! IMPORTANT! when deleting a cookie, you must pass the exact same path and domain attributes that was used to set the cookie, unless you're relying on the default attributes. Namespace conflicts If there is any danger of a conflict with the namespace Cookies, the noConflict method will allow you to define a new namespace and preserve the original one. This is especially useful when running the script on third party sites e.g. as part of a widget or SDK. // Assign the js-cookie api to a different variable and restore the original ""window.Cookies"" var Cookies2 = Cookies.noConflict(); Cookies2.set('name', 'value'); Note: The .noConflict method is not necessary when using AMD or CommonJS, thus it is not exposed in those environments. JSON js-cookie provides unobtrusive JSON storage for cookies. When creating a cookie you can pass an Array or Object Literal instead of a string in the value. If you do so, js-cookie will store the string representation of the object according to JSON.stringify: Cookies.set('name', { foo: 'bar' }); When reading a cookie with the default Cookies.get api, you receive the string representation stored in the cookie: Cookies.get('name'); // => '{""foo"":""bar""}' Cookies.get(); // => { name: '{""foo"":""bar""}' } When reading a cookie with the Cookies.getJSON api, you receive the parsed representation of the string stored in the cookie according to JSON.parse: Cookies.getJSON('name'); // => { foo: 'bar' } Cookies.getJSON(); // => { name: { foo: 'bar' } } Note: To support IE6-7 (and IE 8 compatibility mode) you need to include the JSON-js polyfill: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js Encoding This project is RFC 6265 compliant. All special characters that are not allowed in the cookie-name or cookie-value are encoded with each one's UTF-8 Hex equivalent using percent-encoding. The only character in cookie-name or cookie-value that is allowed and still encoded is the percent % character, it is escaped in order to interpret percent input as literal. Please note that the default encoding/decoding strategy is meant to be interoperable only between cookies that are read/written by js-cookie. To override the default encoding/decoding strategy you need to use a converter. Cookie Attributes Cookie attributes defaults can be set globally by setting properties of the Cookies.defaults object or individually for each call to Cookies.set(...) by passing a plain object in the last argument. Per-call attributes override the default attributes. expires Define when the cookie will be removed. Value can be a Number which will be interpreted as days from time of creation or a Date instance. If omitted, the cookie becomes a session cookie. Default: Cookie is removed when the user closes the browser. Examples: Cookies.set('name', 'value', { expires: 365 }); Cookies.get('name'); // => 'value' Cookies.remove('name'); path A String indicating the path where the cookie is visible. Default: / Examples: Cookies.set('name', 'value', { path: '' }); Cookies.get('name'); // => 'value' Cookies.remove('name', { path: '' }); Note regarding Internet Explorer: Due to an obscure bug in the underlying WinINET InternetGetCookie implementation, IE’s document.cookie will not return a cookie if it was set with a path attribute containing a filename. (From Internet Explorer Cookie Internals (FAQ)) This means one cannot set a path using path: window.location.pathname in case such pathname contains a filename like so: /check.html (or at least, such cookie cannot be read correctly). domain A String indicating a valid domain where the cookie should be visible. The cookie will also be visible to all subdomains. Default: Cookie is visible only to the domain or subdomain of the page where the cookie was created, except for Internet Explorer (see below). Examples: Assuming a cookie that is being created on site.com: Cookies.set('name', 'value', { domain: 'subdomain.site.com' }); Cookies.get('name'); // => undefined (need to read at 'subdomain.site.com') Note regarding Internet Explorer default behavior: Q3: If I don’t specify a DOMAIN attribute (for) a cookie, IE sends it to all nested subdomains anyway? A: Yes, a cookie set on example.com will be sent to sub2.sub1.example.com. Internet Explorer differs from other browsers in this regard. (From Internet Explorer Cookie Internals (FAQ)) This means that if you omit the domain attribute, it will be visible for a subdomain in IE. secure Either true or false, indicating if the cookie transmission requires a secure protocol (https). Default: No secure protocol requirement. Examples: Cookies.set('name', 'value', { secure: true }); Cookies.get('name'); // => 'value' Cookies.remove('name', { secure: true }); Converters Read Create a new instance of the api that overrides the default decoding implementation. All get methods that rely in a proper decoding to work, such as Cookies.get() and Cookies.get('name'), will run the converter first for each cookie. The returning String will be used as the cookie value. Example from reading one of the cookies that can only be decoded using the escape function: document.cookie = 'escaped=%u5317'; document.cookie = 'default=%E5%8C%97'; var cookies = Cookies.withConverter(function (value, name) {     if ( name === 'escaped' ) {         return unescape(value);     } }); cookies.get('escaped'); // 北 cookies.get('default'); // 北 cookies.get(); // { escaped: '北', default: '北' } Write Create a new instance of the api that overrides the default encoding implementation: Cookies.withConverter({     read: function (value, name) {         // Read converter     },     write: function (value, name) {         // Write converter     } }); Server-side integration Check out the Servers Docs Contributing Check out the Contributing Guidelines Manual release steps Increment the ""version"" attribute of package.json Increment the version number in the src/js.cookie.js file Commit with the message ""Release version x.x.x"" Create version tag in git Create a github release and upload the minified file Link the documentation of the latest release tag in the README.md Link the download link to the latest release tag in the README.md Commit with the message ""Prepare for the next development iteration"" Release on npm Authors Klaus Hartl Fagner Brack And awesome contributors Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Features Browser Compatibility Getting the Library Use in CommonJS/Node Environments Without window A Note About Encoding API Reference Features RFC6265 compliant Cross browser Lightweight No dependencies Public domain Supports AMD / CommonJS loaders Browser Compatibility The following browsers have passed all of the automated Cookies.js tests: Chrome Firefox 3+ Safari 4+ Opera 10+ Internet Explorer 6+ Getting the Library Direct downloads v1.2.2 Minified (~1 KB gzipped) v1.2.2 Unminified (~1.7 KB gzipped) Node Package Manager npm install cookies-js Bower bower install cookies-js Use in CommonJS/Node Environments Without window In environments where there is no native window object, Cookies.js will export a factory method that accepts a window instance. For example, using jsdom, you might do something like: var jsdom = require('jsdom'); var window = jsdom.jsdom().parentWindow; var Cookies = require('cookies-js')(window);  // Use Cookies as you normally would A Note About Encoding RFC6265 defines a strict set of allowed characters for cookie keys and values. In order to effectively allow any character to be used in a key or value, Cookies.js will URI encode disallowed characters in their UTF-8 representation. As such, Cookies.js also expects cookie keys and values to already be URI encoded in a UTF-8 representation when it accesses cookies. Keep this in mind when working with cookies on the server side. .NET Users Do not use HttpUtility.UrlEncode and HttpUtility.UrlDecode on cookie keys or values. HttpUtility.UrlEncode will improperly escape space characters to '+' and lower case every escape sequence. HttpUtility.UrlDecode will improperly unescape every '+' to a space character. Instead, use System.Uri.EscapeDataString and System.Uri.UnescapeDataString. API Reference Methods Cookies.set(key, value [, options]) Cookies.get(key) Cookies.expire(key [, options]) Properties Cookies.enabled Cookies.defaults Methods Cookies.set(key, value [, options]) Alias: Cookies(key, value [, options]) Sets a cookie in the document. If the cookie does not already exist, it will be created. Returns the Cookies object. Option Description Default path A string value of the path of the cookie ""/"" domain A string value of the domain of the cookie undefined expires A number (of seconds), a date parsable string, or a Date object of when the cookie will expire undefined secure A boolean value of whether or not the cookie should only be available over SSL false A default value for any option may be set in the Cookies.defaults object. Example Usage // Setting a cookie value Cookies.set('key', 'value');  // Chaining sets together Cookies.set('key', 'value').set('hello', 'world');  // Setting cookies with additional options Cookies.set('key', 'value', { domain: 'www.example.com', secure: true });  // Setting cookies with expiration values Cookies.set('key', 'value', { expires: 600 }); // Expires in 10 minutes Cookies.set('key', 'value', { expires: '01/01/2012' }); Cookies.set('key', 'value', { expires: new Date(2012, 0, 1) }); Cookies.set('key', 'value', { expires: Infinity });  // Using the alias Cookies('key', 'value', { secure: true }); Cookies.get(key) Alias: Cookies(key) Returns the value of the most locally scoped cookie with the specified key.

Usage Add a reference to db.js in your application before you want to use IndexedDB: <script src='/dist/db.js'></script> Alternatively, db.js includes an optional define call, and can be loaded as a module using the AMD loader of your choice. Opening/Creating a database and connection Once you have the script included you can then open connections to each different database within your application: var server; db.open({     server: 'my-app',     version: 1,     schema: {         people: {             key: {keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true},             // Optionally add indexes             indexes: {                 firstName: {},                 answer: {unique: true}             }         }     } }).then(function (s) {     server = s; }); Note that open() takes an options object with the following properties: version - The current version of the database to open. Should be an integer. You can start with 1. You must increase the version if updating the schema or otherwise the schema property will have no effect. server - The name of this server. Any subsequent attempt to open a server with this name (and with the current version) will reuse the already opened connection (unless it has been closed). schema - Expects an object, or, if a function is supplied, a schema object should be returned). A schema object optionally has store names as keys (these stores will be auto-created if not yet added and modified otherwise). The values of these schema objects should be objects, optionally with the property ""key"" and/or ""indexes"". The ""key"" property, if present, should contain valid createObjectStore parameters (keyPath or autoIncrement). The ""indexes"" property should contain an object whose keys are the desired index keys and whose values are objects which can include the optional parameters and values available to createIndex (unique, multiEntry, and, for Firefox-only, locale). Note that the keyPath of the index will be set to the supplied index key, or if present, a keyPath property on the provided parameter object. Note also that when a schema is supplied for a new version, any object stores not present on the schema object will be deleted. A connection is intended to be persisted, and you can perform multiple operations while it's kept open. In the event a connection has already been opened for modification (whether in the same instance or in another tab/window), a blocking error will occur, for which you can listen by adding a Promise.catch statement and communicate with blocking instances still holding a connection so that they may close the connection. You can then return the resume property (a promise) to recover to continue the original open operation and proceed to the following then condition. var server; db.open({     // ... }).catch(function (err) {     if (err.type === 'blocked') {         oldConnection.close();         return err.resume;     }     // Handle other errors here     throw err; }).then(function (s) {     server = s;     // One can add a versionchange handler here to self-close     //   the connection upon future upgrade attempts (likely to     //   be one made in other tabs) and thereby     //   avoid such attempts having to face blocking errors. }); Check out the /tests/specs folder for more examples. General server/store methods Note that by default the methods below (not including close, addEventListener, and removeEventListener) can be called either as server.people.xxx( arg1, arg2, ... ) or server.xxx( 'people', arg1, arg2, ... ). To reduce some memory requirements or avoid a however unlikely potential conflict with server method names, however, one may supply noServerMethods: true as part of options supplied to db.open() and under such conditions, only the second method signature above can be used. Store modification Adding items server.people.add({     firstName: 'Aaron',     lastName: 'Powell',     answer: 42 }).then(function (item) {     // item stored }); Multiple items can be added as additional arguments to add. Another way multiple items can be added is when an array is supplied for any of the arguments in which case, its top level contents will be treated as separate items. If you want unambiguous results where the data to be added could itself be an array, be sure to wrap item supplied in your argument within an array. Note also when add is provided with objects containing a property item (and optionally a key property), the value of item will be treated as the record to be added, while any key will be used as the key. To supply unambiguous items (where you are not sure whether item may exist on the record to be added), you may wish to consistently wrap your items within an object with an item property even if you are not supplying a key. Updating server.people.update({     firstName: 'Aaron',     lastName: 'Powell',     answer: 42 }).then(function (item) {     // item added or updated }); As with add, update shares the same behaviors as far as flattening of the top level of array arguments and checking of item/key properties, so if you need unambiguous results, please see the discussion above. Using update will cause a record to be added if it does not yet exist. put is also available as an alias of update. Removing server.people.remove(1).then(function (key) {     // item removed }); delete is also available as an alias of remove. Clearing This allows removing all items in a table/collection: server.people.clear()     .then(function() {         // all table data is gone.     }); Fetching Getting a single object by key server.people.get(5)     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results     }); Getting a single object by key range If more than one match, it will retrieve the first. With a MongoDB-style range: server.people.get({gte: 1, lt: 3})     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results     }); With an IDBKeyRange: server.people.get(IDBKeyRange.bound(1, 3, false, true))     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results     }); Querying Queries require one or more methods to determine the type of querying (all items, filtering, applying ranges, limits, distinct values, or custom mapping--some of which can be combined with some of the others), any methods for cursor direction, and then a subsequent call to execute() (followed by a then or catch). Querying all objects server.people.query()     .all()     .execute()     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results     }); Querying using indexes server.people.query('specialProperty')     .all()     .execute()     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results (items which possess `specialProperty`)     }); Querying with filtering Note that unlike the other methods after a query, filter can be executed multiple times. Filter with property and value server.people.query()     .filter('firstName', 'Aaron')     .execute()     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results     }); Filter with function server.people.query()     .filter(function(person) {return person.group === 'hipster';})     .execute()     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results     }); Querying for distinct values Will return only one record: server.people     .query('firstName')     .only('Aaron')     .distinct()     .execute()     .then(function (data) {         //     }); Querying with ranges All ranges supported by IDBKeyRange can be used (only, bound, lowerBound, upperBound). server.people.query('firstName')     .only('Aaron')     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results     });  server.people.query('answer')     .bound(30, 50)     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results     }); MongoDB-style ranges (as implemented in idb-range-driven libraries) are also supported: server.people.query('firstName')     .range({eq: 'Aaron'})     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results     });  server.people.query('answer')     .range({gte: 30, lte: 50})     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results     }); Note that IndexedDB allows you to use array keys within ranges (and other methods where a key is accepted) as long as you have created your store with an array keyPath (and optionally with an index keyPath). // The definition: schema: {     people: {         key: {             keyPath: ['lastName', 'firstName']         },         indexes: {             name: {                 keyPath: ['lastName', 'firstName']             },             lastName: {},             firstName: {}         }     } }  // ...elsewhere...  // The query: s.test.query('name')     .only(['Zamir', 'Brett'])     .execute()     .then(function (results) {         // do something with the results     }); Limiting cursor range Unlike key ranges which filter by the range of present values, one may define a cursor range to determine whether to skip through a certain number of initial result items and to select how many items (up to the amount available) should be retrieved from that point in the navigation of the cursor. server.people     .query('firstName')     .all()     .limit(1, 3)     .execute()     .then(function (data) {         // Skips the first item and obtains the next 3 items (or less if there are fewer)     }); Cursor direction (desc) The desc method may be used to change cursor direction to descending order: server.people.query()     .all()     .desc()     .execute()     .then(function (results) {         // Array of results will be in descending order     }); Retrieving special types of values Keys Keys may be retrieved with or without an index: server.people.query('firstName')     .only('Aaron')     .keys()     .execute()     .then(function (results) {         // `results` will contain one 'Aaron' value for each         //    item in the people store with that first name     }); Mapping The map method allows you to modify the object being returned without correspondingly modifying the actual object stored: server.people     .query('age')     .lowerBound(30)     .map(function (value) {         return {             fullName: value.firstName + ' ' + value.lastName,             raw: value         };     })     .execute()     .then(function (data) {         // An array of people objects containing `fullName` and `raw` properties     }); Counting To count while utilizing an index and/or the query-returned methods, you can use the following: server.people.query('firstName')     .only('Aaron')     .count()     .execute()     .then(function (results) {         // `results` will equal the total count of ""Aaron""'s     }); If you only need a count of items in a store with only a key or range, you can utilize server.count: // With no arguments (count all items) server.people.count().then(function (ct) {     // Do something with ""ct"" });  // With a key server.people.count(myKey).then(function (ct) {     // Do something with ""ct"" });  // With a MongoDB-style range server.people.count({gte: 1, lt: 3}).then(function (ct) {     // Do something with ""ct"" });  // With an IDBKeyRange range server.people.count(IDBKeyRange.bound(1, 3, false, true)).then(function (ct) {     // Do something with ""ct"" }); Atomic updates Any query that returns a range of results can also be set to modify the returned records automatically. This is done by adding .modify() at the end of the query (right before .execute()). modify only runs updates on objects matched by the query, and still returns the same results to the Promise's then() method (however, the results will have the modifications applied to them). Examples: // grab all users modified in the last 10 seconds, server.users.query('last_mod')     .lowerBound(new Date().getTime() - 10000)     .modify({last_mod: new Date.getTime()})     .execute()     .then(function(results) {         // now we have a list of recently modified users     });  // grab all changed records and atomically set them as unchanged server.users.query('changed')     .only(true)     .modify({changed: false})     .execute()     .then(...)  // use a function to update the results. the function is passed the original // (unmodified) record, which allows us to update the data based on the record // itself. server.profiles.query('name')     .lowerBound('marcy')     .modify({views: function(profile) { return profile.views + 1; }})     .execute()     .then(...) modify changes will be seen by any map functions. modify can be used after: all, filter, ranges (range, only, bound, upperBound, and lowerBound), desc, distinct, and map. Other server methods Closing connection server.close(); Retrieving the indexedDB.open result object in use var db = server.getIndexedDB(); var storeNames = db.objectStoreNames; Server event handlers All of the following are optional. server.addEventListener('abort', function (e) {     // Handle abort event }); server.addEventListener('error', function (err) {     // Handle any errors (check err.name) }); server.addEventListener('versionchange', function (e) {     // Be notified of version changes (can use e.oldVersion and e.newVersion) }); All of the following shorter equivalent forms (which also work internally via addEventListener) are optional and can be chained as desired. server.abort(function (e) {     // Handle abort event }).error(function (err) {     // Handle any errors (check err.name) }).versionchange(function (e) {     // Be notified of version changes (can use e.oldVersion and e.newVersion) }); See the IndexedDB spec for the possible exceptions. Deleting a database db.delete(dbName).then(function (ev) {     // Should have been a successful database deletion }, function (err) {     // Error during database deletion }); Note that, in line with the behavior of the deleteDatabase method of IndexedDB, delete will not actually produce an error if one attempts to delete a database which doesn't exist or even if a non-string is supplied. However, as with the open operation, a delete operation will produce an error so long as there are already opened blocking connections (i.e., those allowing for database modification) which are open elsewhere in the browser. You can nevertheless recover as follows: db.delete(dbName).catch(function (err) {     if (err.type === 'blocked') {         oldConnection.close();         return err.resume;     }     // Handle other errors here     throw err; }).then(function (ev) {     // Should have been a successful database deletion }); See the documentation on open for more on such recovery from blocking connections. Comparing two keys Returns 1 if the first key is greater than the second, -1 if the first is less than the second, and 0 if the first is equal to the second. db.cmp(key1, key2).then(function (ret) {     // Use `ret` }); Promise notes db.js used the ES6 Promise spec to handle asynchronous operations. All operations that are asynchronous will return an instance of the ES6 Promise object that exposes a then method which will take up to two callbacks, onFulfilled and onRejected. Please refer to the ES6 Promise spec for more information. As of version 0.7.0 db.js's Promise API is designed to work with ES6 Promises, please polyfill it if you would like to use another promise library.

Mar 11, 2016 package.json Bump version Mar 24, 2016 README.md SQLite compiled to javascript For the impatients, try the demo here: http://kripken.github.io/sql.js/GUI/ sql.js is a port of SQLite to JavaScript, by compiling the SQLite C code with Emscripten. no C bindings or node-gyp compilation here. SQLite is public domain, sql.js is MIT licensed. Documentation A full documentation generated from comments inside the source code, is available. Usage var sql = require('sql.js'); // or sql = window.SQL if you are in a browser  // Create a database var db = new sql.Database(); // NOTE: You can also use new sql.Database(data) where // data is an Uint8Array representing an SQLite database file  // Execute some sql sqlstr = ""CREATE TABLE hello (a int, b char);""; sqlstr += ""INSERT INTO hello VALUES (0, 'hello');"" sqlstr += ""INSERT INTO hello VALUES (1, 'world');"" db.run(sqlstr); // Run the query without returning anything  var res = db.exec(""SELECT * FROM hello""); /* [     {columns:['a','b'], values:[[0,'hello'],[1,'world']]} ] */  // Prepare an sql statement var stmt = db.prepare(""SELECT * FROM hello WHERE a=:aval AND b=:bval"");  // Bind values to the parameters and fetch the results of the query var result = stmt.getAsObject({':aval' : 1, ':bval' : 'world'}); console.log(result); // Will print {a:1, b:'world'}  // Bind other values stmt.bind([0, 'hello']); while (stmt.step()) console.log(stmt.get()); // Will print [0, 'hello']  // You can also use javascript functions inside your SQL code // Create the js function you need function add(a, b) {return a+b;} // Specifies the SQL function's name, the number of it's arguments, and the js function to use db.create_function(""add_js"", add); // Run a query in which the function is used db.run(""INSERT INTO hello VALUES (add_js(7, 3), add_js('Hello ', 'world'));""); // Inserts 10 and 'Hello world'  // free the memory used by the statement stmt.free(); // You can not use your statement anymore once it has been freed. // But not freeing your statements causes memory leaks. You don't want that.  // Export the database to an Uint8Array containing the SQLite database file var binaryArray = db.export(); Demo There is an online demo available here : http://kripken.github.io/sql.js/GUI Examples The test files provide up to date example of the use of the api. Inside the browser Example HTML file: <script src='js/sql.js'></script> <script>     //Create the database     var db = new SQL.Database();     // Run a query without reading the results     db.run(""CREATE TABLE test (col1, col2);"");     // Insert two rows: (1,111) and (2,222)     db.run(""INSERT INTO test VALUES (?,?), (?,?)"", [1,111,2,222]);      // Prepare a statement     var stmt = db.prepare(""SELECT * FROM test WHERE col1 BETWEEN $start AND $end"");     stmt.getAsObject({$start:1, $end:1}); // {col1:1, col2:111}      // Bind new values     stmt.bind({$start:1, $end:2});     while(stmt.step()) { //         var row = stmt.getAsObject();         // [...] do something with the row of result     } </script> Creating a database from a file choosen by the user SQL.Database constructor takes an array of integer representing a database file as an optional parameter. The following code uses an HTML input as the source for loading a database: dbFileElm.onchange = function() {     var f = dbFileElm.files[0];     var r = new FileReader();     r.onload = function() {         var Uints = new Uint8Array(r.result);         db = new SQL.Database(Uints);     }     r.readAsArrayBuffer(f); } See : http://kripken.github.io/sql.js/GUI/gui.js Loading a database from a server var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', '/path/to/database.sqlite', true); xhr.responseType = 'arraybuffer';  xhr.onload = function(e) {   var uInt8Array = new Uint8Array(this.response);   var db = new SQL.Database(uInt8Array);   var contents = db.exec(""SELECT * FROM my_table"");   // contents is now [{columns:['col1','col2',...], values:[[first row], [second row], ...]}] }; xhr.send(); See: https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/wiki/Load-a-database-from-the-server Use from node.js sql.js is hosted on npm. To install it, you can simply run npm install sql.js. Alternatively, you can simply download the file sql.js, from the download link below. read a database from the disk: var fs = require('fs'); var SQL = require('sql.js'); var filebuffer = fs.readFileSync('test.sqlite');  // Load the db var db = new SQL.Database(filebuffer); write a database to the disk You need to convert the result of db.export to a buffer var fs = require(""fs""); // [...] (create the database) var data = db.export(); var buffer = new Buffer(data); fs.writeFileSync(""filename.sqlite"", buffer); See : https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/blob/master/test/test_node_file.js Use as web worker If you don't want to run CPU-intensive SQL queries in your main application thread, you can use the more limited WebWorker API. You will need to download worker.sql.js Example: <script> var worker = new Worker(""js/worker.sql.js""); // You can find worker.sql.js in this repo worker.onmessage = function() {     console.log(""Database opened"");     worker.onmessage = function(event){         console.log(event.data); // The result of the query     };     worker.postMessage({         id: 2,         action: 'exec',         sql: 'SELECT * FROM test'     }); };  worker.onerror = function(e) {console.log(""Worker error: "", e)}; worker.postMessage({     id:1,     action:'open',     buffer:buf, /*Optional. An ArrayBuffer representing an SQLite Database file*/ }); </script> See : https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/blob/master/test/test_worker.js Downloads You can download sql.js here : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kripken/sql.js/master/js/sql.js And the Web Worker version: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kripken/sql.js/master/js/worker.sql.js You can find a non minified or optimized version for debugging, sql-debug.js here : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kripken/sql.js/master/js/sql-debug.js If you see the message, Cannot enlarge memory arrays, try this version, sql-memory-growth.js here : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kripken/sql.js/master/js/sql-memory-growth.js Related In-Browser/Client-Side Demo Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

See the results on the demo. randomColor is available minified on cdnjs. It is also distributed on npm and bower. npm install randomcolor randomColor has been ported to C#, Go, PHP, Python, Swift, Objective-C, Java and R. Options You can pass an options object to influence the type of color it produces. The options object accepts the following properties: Hue – Controls the hue of the generated color. You can pass a string representing a color name: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink and monochrome are currently supported. Luminosity – Controls the luminosity of the generated color. You can specify a string containing bright, light or dark. Count – An integer which specifies the number of colors to generate. Seed - An integer or string which when passed will cause randomColor to return the same color each time. Format – A string which specifies the format of the generated color. Possible values are rgb, rgbArray, hsl, hslArray and hex (default). Examples // Returns a hex code for an attractive color randomColor();   // Returns an array of ten green colors randomColor({    count: 10,    hue: 'green' });  // Returns a hex code for a light blue randomColor({    luminosity: 'light',    hue: 'blue' });  // Returns a hex code for a 'truly random' color randomColor({    luminosity: 'random',    hue: 'random' });  // Returns a bright color in RGB randomColor({    luminosity: 'bright',    format: 'rgb' // e.g. 'rgb(225,200,20)' });  // Returns a dark RGB color with random alpha randomColor({    luminosity: 'dark',    format: 'rgba' // e.g. 'rgba(9, 1, 107, 0.6482447960879654)' });  // Returns a light HSL color with random alpha randomColor({    luminosity: 'light',    format: 'hsla' // e.g. 'hsla(27, 88.99%, 81.83%, 0.6450211517512798)' });  License This project is dedicated to the public domain. To do More generally, it might be a good idea to consider using other color models. When returning an array of multiple colors, try to make each color as distinct as possible. Make sure each color is distinct to its neighbours. Improve attractive dark color generation, currently they're a touch murky. Improve the color dictionary definition of hue values and attractive luminosity bounds think about how to store hue aliases (e.g. fuschia) or subranges (e.g teal) think about making a little point and click tool for defining your own luminosity bounds and customizing the color dictionary Think about how to return seeds. Think about adding feature to return complementary & contrasting colors, as well as color triads, tetrads etc. Other libraries might already do this better though. Think about adding a scheme options which would return a dominant color, as well as secondary, tertiary color and primary and secondary text colors. This might be a bad idea.

Nov 10, 2014 README.md PleaseJS www.checkman.io/please Please.js is a polite companion that wants to help you make your projects beautiful. It uses HSV color space to create random pleasing colors as well as color schemes based on a given color. It has two core functions and a bunch of little helpers for you to use. Please.make_color(); //or Please.make_scheme( {     h: 145,     s: .7,     v: .6 }, {     scheme_type: 'triadic',     format: 'rgb-string' }); Core make_color Please.make_color({options}) The make_color function by default will generate and return a random hex string using the golden ratio to ensure that the color will look nice on your screen. You can also pass an options object to make_color and have it do a whole bunch of different things. make_color options: hue: (0-360) By setting the hue, you determine the color. saturation: (0.0-1.0) By setting the saturation, you determine the distance from gray. value: (0.0-1.0) By setting the value, you determine the balance between black and white. base_color: ('the name of an HTML color') Setting a base_color (e.g. 'pink') will create a random color within the HSV range of the chosen color. Please will recognize any of the 146 standard HTML colors, it has a very good memory. greyscale | grayscale: (true/false) Setting either greyscale or grayscale (but we all know which one is correct) to true will cause all of the colors you generate to be within the grey or gray range. This is effectively the same as setting your saturation to 0. golden: (true/false) Setting golden to true randomizes your hue (overrides hue setting) and makes you a spectacular color based on the golden ratio. It's so good, it's the default. Make sure to turn it off if you want to have more control over your generated colors. full_random: (true/false) Setting full_random to true will make Please lose its mind. It will completely randomize the hue, saturation, and value of the colors it makes. colors_returned: (1-infinity) Setting colors_returned to higher than 1 will return an array full of the colors Please has made for you. If you set it to 1, you'll just get the one color! It makes a sort of sense if you think about it. format: ('format string') Setting format string, will change the format of what make_color will return for you. The options are as follows (example is the color black): 'hex' = '#000000' 'rgb' = {r: 0, g: 0,b: 0} 'rgb-string' = 'rgb(0,0,0)' 'hsv' = {h: 0, s: 0, v: 0} Here are the defaults for each option: {     hue: null,     saturation: null,     value: null,     base_color: '',     greyscale: false,     grayscale: false,     golden: true,     full_random: false,     colors_returned: 1,     format: 'hex', } Here is an example of a fully random color call: Please.make_color({     golden: false,     full_random: true }); Here is an example that will produce 100 reds as RGB strings: Please.make_color({     golden: false,     base_color: 'red',     colors_returned: 100,     format: 'rgb-string' }); make_scheme The second core function allows Please to make a color scheme for you. Please.make_scheme(base_color,{options}) The make scheme function will return a series of colors based upon the color and options you feed it. The base_color must be in HSV color space and is an object in the format of {     h: ___,     s: ___,     v: ___ } make_scheme options: scheme_type 'monochromatic' | 'mono' - Makes a 5 color scheme using your provided color, all the colors will be fairly similar to each other. 'complementary' | 'complement' - Makes a two color scheme using your provided color, the 2nd color will be the complement of the 1st, such that mixing them will create a neutral grey. 'split-complementary' | 'split-complement' | 'split' - Makes a three color scheme where the 2nd and 3rd colors are at a 30 degree split from the complement of the 1st color. 'double-complementary' | 'double-complement' | 'double' - Makes a four color scheme where the 2nd color is the complement of the 1st, and the 3rd and 4th colors are complements of each other at a 30 degree ofset from the first pair 'analogous' | 'ana' - Makes a six color scheme where each additional color is offset from the 1st by 20 degrees. 'triadic' | 'triad' | 'tri' - Makes a 3 color scheme where the 2nd and 3rd color are equally spaced from the 1st. format: ('format string') Setting format string, will change the format of what make scheme will return for you. The options are as follows (example is the color white): 'hex' = '#ffffff' 'rgb' = {r: 255, g: 255,b: 255} 'rgb-string' = 'rgb(255,255,255)' 'hsv' = {h: 0, s: 0, v: 1} Here is an example of a complementary scheme in hex: Please.make_scheme( {     h: 130,     s: .7.     v: .75 }, {     scheme_type: 'complement',     format: 'hex' }); Here is an example that will produce a triadic scheme in rgb-strings: Please.make_scheme( {     h: 130,     s: .7.     v: .75 }, {     scheme_type: 'triadic',     format: 'rgb-string' }); Here are the defaults for each option: {     scheme_type: 'analogous',     format: 'hex' } Other Methods Please also has some bonus features. It allows you to convert freely between the color formats of RGB, HSV, and HEX. RGB_to_HEX() HEX_to_RGB() RGB_to_HSV() HSV_to_RGB() HEX_to_HSV() HSV_to_HEX() conversion from HSV or RGB expect an object with the properties {     r: 0-255,     g: 0-255,     b: 0-255 } and {     h: 0-360,     s: 0.0-1.0,     v: 0,0-1.0 } respectively, while converstions from HEX expect a string. Return formats are modeled the same way as the arguments. In addition Please, can convert from an HTML color name into HEX, RGB, or HSV. NAME_to_HEX() NAME_to_RGB() NAME_to_HSV() These functions take a string and return a HEX string or an RGB/HSV object. I hope you enjoy using Please. Have fun, and remember to say the magic word.

It allows many forms of input, while providing color conversions and other color utility functions. It has no dependencies. Including in a browser Download tinycolor.js or install it with bower: bower install tinycolor  Then just include it in the page in a script tag: <script type='text/javascript' src='tinycolor.js'></script> <script type='text/javascript'> var color = tinycolor(""red""); </script> Including in node tinycolor may also be included as a node module like so: npm install tinycolor2  Then it can be used in your script like so: var tinycolor = require(""tinycolor2""); var color = tinycolor(""red""); Usage Call tinycolor(input) or new tinycolor(input), and you will have an object with the following properties. See Accepted String Input and Accepted Object Input below for more information about what is accepted. Accepted String Input The string parsing is very permissive. It is meant to make typing a color as input as easy as possible. All commas, percentages, parenthesis are optional, and most input allow either 0-1, 0%-100%, or 0-n (where n is either 100, 255, or 360 depending on the value). HSL and HSV both require either 0%-100% or 0-1 for the S/L/V properties. The H (hue) can have values between 0%-100% or 0-360. RGB input requires either 0-255 or 0%-100%. If you call tinycolor.fromRatio, RGB and Hue input can also accept 0-1. Here are some examples of string input: Hex, 8-digit (RGBA) Hex tinycolor(""#000""); tinycolor(""000""); tinycolor(""#369C""); tinycolor(""369C""); tinycolor(""#f0f0f6""); tinycolor(""f0f0f6""); tinycolor(""#f0f0f688""); tinycolor(""f0f0f688""); RGB, RGBA tinycolor(""rgb (255, 0, 0)""); tinycolor(""rgb 255 0 0""); tinycolor(""rgba (255, 0, 0, .5)""); tinycolor({ r: 255, g: 0, b: 0 }); tinycolor.fromRatio({ r: 1, g: 0, b: 0 }); tinycolor.fromRatio({ r: .5, g: .5, b: .5 }); HSL, HSLA tinycolor(""hsl(0, 100%, 50%)""); tinycolor(""hsla(0, 100%, 50%, .5)""); tinycolor(""hsl(0, 100%, 50%)""); tinycolor(""hsl 0 1.0 0.5""); tinycolor({ h: 0, s: 1, l: .5 }); tinycolor.fromRatio({ h: 1, s: 0, l: 0 }); tinycolor.fromRatio({ h: .5, s: .5, l: .5 }); HSV, HSVA tinycolor(""hsv(0, 100%, 100%)""); tinycolor(""hsva(0, 100%, 100%, .5)""); tinycolor(""hsv (0 100% 100%)""); tinycolor(""hsv 0 1 1""); tinycolor({ h: 0, s: 100, v: 100 }); tinycolor.fromRatio({ h: 1, s: 0, v: 0 }); tinycolor.fromRatio({ h: .5, s: .5, v: .5 }); Named tinycolor(""RED""); tinycolor(""blanchedalmond""); tinycolor(""darkblue""); Accepted Object Input If you are calling this from code, you may want to use object input.

It provides a simple solution for interpolation and pluralization, based off of Airbnb's experience adding I18n functionality to its Backbone.js and Node apps. Polyglot has zero dependencies. I18n is incredibly important for us at Airbnb, as we have listings in 192 countries, and we translate our site into 30-odd different languages. We're also hiring talented engineers to help us scale up to meet the challenges of buliding a global marketplace. View the documentation on Github. View the annotated source. Download the development version: 7.9kb, unminified with comments. Download the production version: 2.8kb, minified (1.3kb gzipped). Polylglot is agnostic to your translation backend. It doesn't perform any translation; it simply gives you a way to manage translated phrases from your client- or server-side JavaScript application. Installation For use with Node, install with NPM: $ npm install node-polyglot  Running the tests Clone the repo, run npm install, and npm test. Usage Instantiation First, create an instance of the Polyglot class, which you will use for translation. var polyglot = new Polyglot(); Polyglot is class-based so you can maintain different sets of phrases at the same time, possibly in different locales. This is very useful for example when serving requests with Express, because each request may have a different locale, and you don't want concurrent requests to clobber each other's phrases. Translation Tell Polyglot what to say by simply giving it a phrases object, where the key is the canonical name of the phrase and the value is the already-translated string. polyglot.extend({   ""hello"": ""Hello"" });  polyglot.t(""hello""); => ""Hello"" You can also pass a mapping at instantiation, using the key phrases: var polyglot = new Polyglot({phrases: {""hello"": ""Hello""}}); Polyglot doesn't do the translation for you. It's up to you to give it the proper phrases for the user's locale. A common pattern is to gather a hash of phrases in your backend, and output them in a <script> tag at the bottom of the document. For example, in Rails: app/controllers/home_controller.rb def index   @phrases = {     ""home.login"" => I18n.t(""home.login""),     ""home.signup"" => I18n.t(""home.signup""),     ...   } end app/views/home/index.html.erb <script>   var polyglot = new Polyglot({phrases: <%= raw @phrases.to_json %>}); </script> And now you can utilize i.e. polyglot.t(""home.login"") in your JavaScript application or Handlebars templates. Interpolation Polyglot.t() also provides interpolation. Pass an object with key-value pairs of interpolation arguments as the second parameter. polyglot.extend({   ""hello_name"": ""Hola, %{name}."" });  polyglot.t(""hello_name"", {name: ""DeNiro""}); => ""Hola, DeNiro."" Polyglot also supports nested phrase objects. polyglot.extend({   ""nav"": {     ""hello"": ""Hello"",     ""hello_name"": ""Hello, %{name}"",     ""sidebar"": {       ""welcome"": ""Welcome""     }   } });  polyglot.t(""nav.sidebar.welcome""); => ""Welcome"" Pluralization For pluralization to work properly, you need to tell Polyglot what the current locale is. You can use polyglot.locale(""fr"") to set the locale to, for example, French. This method is also a getter: polyglot.locale() => ""fr"" You can also pass this in during instantiation. var polyglot = new Polyglot({locale: ""fr""}); Currently, the only thing that Polyglot uses this locale setting for is pluralization. Polyglot provides a very basic pattern for providing pluralization based on a single string that contains all plural forms for a given phrase. Because various languages have different nominal forms for zero, one, and multiple, and because the noun can be before or after the count, we have to be overly explicit about the possible phrases. To get a pluralized phrase, still use polyglot.t() but use a specially-formatted phrase string that separates the plural forms by the delimeter ||||, or four vertical pipe characters. For pluralizing ""car"" in English, Polyglot assumes you have a phrase of the form: polyglot.extend({   ""num_cars"": ""%{smart_count} car |||| %{smart_count} cars"", }); In English (and German, Spanish, Italian, and a few others) there are only two plural forms: singular and not-singular. Some languages get a bit more complicated. In Czech, there are three separate forms: 1, 2 through 4, and 5 and up. Russian is even crazier. polyglot.t() will choose the appropriate phrase based on the provided smart_count option, whose value is a number. polyglot.t(""num_cars"", {smart_count: 0}); => ""0 cars""  polyglot.t(""num_cars"", {smart_count: 1}); => ""1 car""  polyglot.t(""num_cars"", {smart_count: 2}); => ""2 cars"" As a shortcut, you can also pass a number to the second parameter: polyglot.t(""num_cars"", 2); => ""2 cars"" Public Methods Polyglot.prototype.extend(phrases) Use extend to tell Polyglot how to translate a given key. polyglot.extend({   ""hello"": ""Hello"",   ""hello_name"": ""Hello, %{name}"" }); The key can be any string. Feel free to call extend multiple times; it will override any phrases with the same key, but leave existing phrases untouched. Polyglot.prototype.clear() Clears all phrases. Useful for special cases, such as freeing up memory if you have lots of phrases but no longer need to perform any translation. Also used internally by replace. Polyglot.prototype.replace(phrases) Completely replace the existing phrases with a new set of phrases. Normally, just use extend to add more phrases, but under certain circumstances, you may want to make sure no old phrases are lying around. Polyglot.prototype.t(key, interpolationOptions) The most-used method. Provide a key, and t() will return the phrase. polyglot.t(""hello""); => ""Hello""  The phrase value is provided first by a call to polyglot.extend() or polyglot.replace(). Pass in an object as the second argument to perform interpolation. polyglot.t(""hello_name"", {name: ""Spike""}); => ""Hello, Spike""  Pass a number as the second argument as a shortcut to smart_count: // same as: polyglot.t(""car"", {smart_count: 2}); polyglot.t(""car"", 2); => ""2 cars"" If you like, you can provide a default value in case the phrase is missing. Use the special option key ""_"" to specify a default. polyglot.t(""i_like_to_write_in_language"", {   _: ""I like to write in %{language}."",   language: ""JavaScript"" }); => ""I like to write in JavaScript.""

Classic solutions use multiple phrases for plurals. Babelfish defines plurals inline instead - that's more compact, and easy for programmers. Also, phrases are grouped into nested scopes, like in Ruby. BabelFish supports all plural rules from unicode CLDR (via plurals-cldr). Installation node.js: $ npm install babelfish browser: $ bower install babelfish Use es5-shim for old browsers compatibility. Phrases Syntax #{varname} Echoes value of variable ((Singular|Plural1|Plural2)):count Plural form example: А у меня в кармане #{nails_count} ((гвоздь|гвоздя|гвоздей)):nails_count You can also omit anchor variable for plurals, by default it will be count. Thus following variants are equal: I have #{count} ((nail|nails)) I have #{count} ((nail|nails)):count Also you can use variables in plural parts: I have ((#{count} nail|#{count} nails)) Need special zero form or overwrite any specific value? No problems: I have ((=0 no nails|#{count} nail|#{count} nails)) Escape chars If you need #{, ((, | or )) somewhere in text, where it can be considered as markup part - just escape them with \. Example with YAML As BabelFish flatten scopes, it's really fun and nice to store translations in YAML files: --- ru-RU:   profile: Профиль   forums: Форумы   apps:     forums:       new_topic: Новая тема       last_post:         title : Последнее сообщение         by : от   demo:     apples: ""На столе лежит #{count} ((яблоко|яблока|яблок))"" Usage // Create new instance of BabelFish with default language/locale: 'en-GB' var BabelFish = require('babelfish'); var i18n = new BabelFish('en-GB');   // Fill in some phrases i18n.addPhrase('en-GB', 'demo.hello',         'Hello, #{user.name}.'); i18n.addPhrase('en-GB', 'demo.conv.wazup',    'Whats up?'); i18n.addPhrase('en-GB', 'demo.conv.alright',  'Alright, man!'); i18n.addPhrase('en-GB', 'demo.coerce',        'Total: #{count}.');  i18n.addPhrase('ru-RU', 'demo.hello',         'Привет, #{user.name}.'); i18n.addPhrase('ru-RU', 'demo.conv.wazup',    'Как дела?');  i18n.addPhrase('uk-UA', 'demo.hello',         'Здоровенькі були, #{user.name}.');   // Set locale fallback to use the most appropriate translation when possible i18n.setFallback('uk-UA', 'ru-RU');   // Translate var params = {user: {name: 'ixti'}};  i18n.t('ru-RU', 'demo.hello', params);  // -> 'Привет, ixti.' i18n.t('ru-RU', 'demo.conv.wazup');     // -> 'Как дела?' i18n.t('ru-RU', 'demo.conv.alright');   // -> 'Alright, man!'  i18n.t('uk-UA', 'demo.hello', params);  // -> 'Здоровенькі були, ixti.' i18n.t('uk-UA', 'demo.conv.wazup');     // -> 'Как дела?' i18n.t('uk-UA', 'demo.conv.alright');   // -> 'Alright, man!'  // When params is number or strings, it will be coerced to // `{ count: XXX, value: XXX }` - use any of those in phrase. i18n.t('en-GB', 'demo.coerce', 5);      // -> 'Total: 5.'   // You may wish to ""dump"" translations to load in browser later // Dump will include all fallback translations and fallback rules var locale_dump = i18n.stringify('ru-RU');  var i18n_new = require('babelfish')('en-GB'); // init without `new` also works i18n_new.load(locale_dump);   // Use objects instead of strings (object/array/number/boolean) - can be // useful to prepare bulk data for external libraries. // Note, only JSON-supported types are ok (no date & regex) i18n.addPhrase('en-GB', 'demo.boolean',  true); i18n.addPhrase('en-GB', 'demo.number',   123); i18n.addPhrase('en-GB', 'demo.array',    [1, 2, 3]); // fourth param required for hashes (objects) to disable flattening, // other types are autodetected i18n.addPhrase('en-GB', 'demo.array',    { foo:1, bar:""2"" }, false); Implementations in other languages Perl - Locale::Babelfish Ruby - https://github.com/regru/babelfish-ruby License View the LICENSE file (MIT).

Standalone version of Lava.ClassManager One of the fastest and most convenient class systems in the world. Quick facts: Speed is comparable to native hand-written classes Powerful features like run-time prototype patching and shared members Classes can be generated on server and in browser Supports multiple inheritance Docs: Basic tutorial Detailed reference Patches and static constructors Packages API Standalone version is self-contained (it does not have any dependencies, like the main framework). Performance Performance comparison of the fastest class systems: Overridden method calls: http://jsperf.com/js-inheritance-method-calls/2 Object construction: http://jsperf.com/js-inheritance-object-construction For your convenience, performance tests have their own repository: https://github.com/kogarashisan/PerfTests Performance notes ClassManager can generate classes in two modes, depending on is_monomorphic switch. Monomorphic mode generates classes with slower constructors, but fast method calls (due to the fact, that all class instances will have the same internal type, reducing method polymorphism). Polymorphic mode generates fast constructors with slower method calls. Constructor generation performance Creating a class constructor takes some time in all class systems (not class instance, but the constructor). There are no performance tests for class definitions, cause it's not fair to compare browser-only class systems with language preprocessors. You should know, that class generation in ClassManager is slower in comparison to other systems, but: it's still very fast, so you can comfortably use it in browser generated classes are extremely fast classes can be generated on server (like with CoffeeScript or TypeScript preprocessors) Usage example ClassManager is available as NPM module, which can be installed with the following command: npm install lava-class-manager  You may either require(""lava-class-manager"") (in Node.js environment) or include it directly in browser. You will get a partial copy of Lava object with ClassManager and it's dependencies. // in Node.js environment: var Lava = require(""lava-class-manager""); // in browser: // <script src=""path/to/ClassManager/lib/class_manager.js""></script>  // namespaces is a must Lava.ClassManager.registerRootNamespace('global', window);  Lava.ClassManager.define( 'global.Animal', {     name: null,     steps: 0,     food: [], // will NOT be shared across class instances      // constructor     init: function(name) {         this.name = name;     },     walk: function() {         this.steps++;     } });  Lava.ClassManager.define( 'global.Cat', {     Extends: 'global.Animal',     init: function(name) {         this.Animal$init(name); // parent method call     } });  var cat = new Cat(""Garfield""); cat.walk();  Lava.instanceOf(cat, ""global.Animal""); JSDoc annotations and IDE support You can help IDE to recognize ClassManager inheritance model by adding proper JSDoc comments to each class: Lava.define( 'Lava.data.MetaStorage', /**  * @lends Lava.data.MetaStorage#  * @extends Lava.data.ModuleAbstract  * @extends Lava.mixin.Properties  */ {     Extends: 'Lava.data.ModuleAbstract',     Implements: 'Lava.mixin.Properties',     // ... });  Parent class and all mixins should be listed with @extends JSDoc tag - this will enable IDE hinting for parent members. Class itself should be exported by @lends tag - this will enable hinting on constructed object instances. This technique works in PHPStorm. Unfortunately, parent method calls can not be automatically recognized at this moment. Extras You can reuse several classes, that come with the main framework: Lava.system.Serializer - pretty-print any JavaScript objects (even those, which contain functions). Source Lava.mixin.Observable - carefully thought-out events for your classes. Source Lava.mixin.Properties - adds get() and set() methods to manipulate properties and fires two kinds of ""changed"" events when they change. Source Limitations While using compression - you can not mangle method names in class bodies, cause this will break inheritance. Good-behaving compression tools will not do it, anyway. There is no official way to define a true private method: private methods in JavaScript are considered bad practice by the author, cause they usually come at cost of inflexibility and speed. Instead, you are recommended to use protected methods (name begins wih underscore). But if you really need it - you can create a private method with traditional techniques. Changelog 1.1.0 [Feature] Added Lava.ClassManager.is_monomorphic property (true by default) - in this mode generated constructors will preallocate all class properties to reduce function polymorphism. This will make construction slower, but operation will be faster. Each _cClassData now has is_monomorphic property, which indicates if it was built in monomorphic mode. [Feature] Added loadClasses() and loadSkeletons() convenience methods [Refactoring] RegExp objects are now moved to prototype. If you want to have unique copy of regular expression object for each class instance - then you should assign it in constructor. [Refactoring] Changed format of exported classes: now it exports both references and own_references arrays - you should delete either one of them. If you leave references - then you will get large, but fast and truly monomorphic class with it's own methods. In most scenarios you will want to leave own_references for smaller output. [Refactoring] Changed format of generated skeleton (if you did not export classes - then ignore) [Refactoring] Renamed ClassManager#INLINE_SIMPLE_ARRAYS -> inline_simple_arrays [Refactoring] Added Lava.define - proxy to Lava.ClassManager.define [Fix] Fixed several serialization bugs. Light performance improvements. 1.0.3 [Fix] Fixed an issue in Node.js environment, when generated constructor was invalid. Slightly improved performance. 1.0.2 [Feature] Added possibility to store arrays in Shared [Refactoring] Removed _cClassData#level as redundant [Refactoring] exportClass now produces slightly less data [Refactoring] Now it ensures that members, which are shared in parent class, are not marked as shared in inherited class [Refactoring] Shared objects are now copied directly from class body, instead of shallow copy. May matter, if you create class instances before calling ClassManager#exportClass, otherwise ignore 1.0.1 Added Lava.instanceOf() method - analog of instanceof JS operator Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Inspired by giants like Jeremy Ashkenas and John Resig, augment is an augmentation of ideas. Classes created using augment have a CoffeeScript-like class structure, and a syntax like John Resig's classes; but they are more readable, intuitive and orders of magnitude faster. In addition they work on virtually every JavaScript platform. Installation You can install augment on node.js using the npm command npm install augment. You can install augment on RingoJS using the rp command rp install augment. You can install augment for web apps using the component command component install javascript/augment. You can install augment for web apps using the bower command bower install augment. Usage You can use augment as a CommonJS module: var augment = require(""augment""); // module.exports must be supported You can use augment with the AMD API: define([""augment""], function (augment) {     // .... }); You can include the latest copy in your web pages, fiddles and benchmarks: <script src=""https://rawgithub.com/javascript/augment/master/augment.js""></script> You can browse the source code and stick it into your program.

Provided be… Jun 10, 2011 README.md This is Q version 1, from the v1 branch in Git. This documentation applies to the latest of both the version 1 and version 0.9 release trains. These releases are stable. There will be no further releases of 0.9 after 0.9.7 which is nearly equivalent to version 1.0.0. All further releases of q@~1.0 will be backward compatible. The version 2 release train introduces significant and backward-incompatible changes and is experimental at this time. If a function cannot return a value or throw an exception without blocking, it can return a promise instead. A promise is an object that represents the return value or the thrown exception that the function may eventually provide. A promise can also be used as a proxy for a remote object to overcome latency. On the first pass, promises can mitigate the “Pyramid of Doom”: the situation where code marches to the right faster than it marches forward. step1(function (value1) {     step2(value1, function(value2) {         step3(value2, function(value3) {             step4(value3, function(value4) {                 // Do something with value4             });         });     }); }); With a promise library, you can flatten the pyramid. Q.fcall(promisedStep1) .then(promisedStep2) .then(promisedStep3) .then(promisedStep4) .then(function (value4) {     // Do something with value4 }) .catch(function (error) {     // Handle any error from all above steps }) .done(); With this approach, you also get implicit error propagation, just like try, catch, and finally. An error in promisedStep1 will flow all the way to the catch function, where it’s caught and handled. (Here promisedStepN is a version of stepN that returns a promise.) The callback approach is called an “inversion of control”. A function that accepts a callback instead of a return value is saying, “Don’t call me, I’ll call you.”. Promises un-invert the inversion, cleanly separating the input arguments from control flow arguments. This simplifies the use and creation of API’s, particularly variadic, rest and spread arguments. Getting Started The Q module can be loaded as: A <script> tag (creating a Q global variable): ~2.5 KB minified and gzipped. A Node.js and CommonJS module, available in npm as the q package An AMD module A component as microjs/q Using bower as q#1.0.1 Using NuGet as Q Q can exchange promises with jQuery, Dojo, When.js, WinJS, and more. Resources Our wiki contains a number of useful resources, including: A method-by-method Q API reference. A growing examples gallery, showing how Q can be used to make everything better. From XHR to database access to accessing the Flickr API, Q is there for you. There are many libraries that produce and consume Q promises for everything from file system/database access or RPC to templating. For a list of some of the more popular ones, see Libraries. If you want materials that introduce the promise concept generally, and the below tutorial isn't doing it for you, check out our collection of presentations, blog posts, and podcasts. A guide for those coming from jQuery's $.Deferred. We'd also love to have you join the Q-Continuum mailing list. Tutorial Promises have a then method, which you can use to get the eventual return value (fulfillment) or thrown exception (rejection). promiseMeSomething() .then(function (value) { }, function (reason) { }); If promiseMeSomething returns a promise that gets fulfilled later with a return value, the first function (the fulfillment handler) will be called with the value. However, if the promiseMeSomething function gets rejected later by a thrown exception, the second function (the rejection handler) will be called with the exception. Note that resolution of a promise is always asynchronous: that is, the fulfillment or rejection handler will always be called in the next turn of the event loop (i.e. process.nextTick in Node). This gives you a nice guarantee when mentally tracing the flow of your code, namely that then will always return before either handler is executed. In this tutorial, we begin with how to consume and work with promises. We'll talk about how to create them, and thus create functions like promiseMeSomething that return promises, below. Propagation The then method returns a promise, which in this example, I’m assigning to outputPromise. var outputPromise = getInputPromise() .then(function (input) { }, function (reason) { }); The outputPromise variable becomes a new promise for the return value of either handler. Since a function can only either return a value or throw an exception, only one handler will ever be called and it will be responsible for resolving outputPromise. If you return a value in a handler, outputPromise will get fulfilled. If you throw an exception in a handler, outputPromise will get rejected. If you return a promise in a handler, outputPromise will “become” that promise. Being able to become a new promise is useful for managing delays, combining results, or recovering from errors. If the getInputPromise() promise gets rejected and you omit the rejection handler, the error will go to outputPromise: var outputPromise = getInputPromise() .then(function (value) { }); If the input promise gets fulfilled and you omit the fulfillment handler, the value will go to outputPromise: var outputPromise = getInputPromise() .then(null, function (error) { }); Q promises provide a fail shorthand for then when you are only interested in handling the error: var outputPromise = getInputPromise() .fail(function (error) { }); If you are writing JavaScript for modern engines only or using CoffeeScript, you may use catch instead of fail. Promises also have a fin function that is like a finally clause. The final handler gets called, with no arguments, when the promise returned by getInputPromise() either returns a value or throws an error. The value returned or error thrown by getInputPromise() passes directly to outputPromise unless the final handler fails, and may be delayed if the final handler returns a promise. var outputPromise = getInputPromise() .fin(function () {     // close files, database connections, stop servers, conclude tests }); If the handler returns a value, the value is ignored If the handler throws an error, the error passes to outputPromise If the handler returns a promise, outputPromise gets postponed. The eventual value or error has the same effect as an immediate return value or thrown error: a value would be ignored, an error would be forwarded. If you are writing JavaScript for modern engines only or using CoffeeScript, you may use finally instead of fin. Chaining There are two ways to chain promises. You can chain promises either inside or outside handlers. The next two examples are equivalent. return getUsername() .then(function (username) {     return getUser(username)     .then(function (user) {         // if we get here without an error,         // the value returned here         // or the exception thrown here         // resolves the promise returned         // by the first line     }) }); return getUsername() .then(function (username) {     return getUser(username); }) .then(function (user) {     // if we get here without an error,     // the value returned here     // or the exception thrown here     // resolves the promise returned     // by the first line }); The only difference is nesting. It’s useful to nest handlers if you need to capture multiple input values in your closure. function authenticate() {     return getUsername()     .then(function (username) {         return getUser(username);     })     // chained because we will not need the user name in the next event     .then(function (user) {         return getPassword()         // nested because we need both user and password next         .then(function (password) {             if (user.passwordHash !== hash(password)) {                 throw new Error(""Can't authenticate"");             }         });     }); } Combination You can turn an array of promises into a promise for the whole, fulfilled array using all. return Q.all([     eventualAdd(2, 2),     eventualAdd(10, 20) ]); If you have a promise for an array, you can use spread as a replacement for then. The spread function “spreads” the values over the arguments of the fulfillment handler. The rejection handler will get called at the first sign of failure. That is, whichever of the received promises fails first gets handled by the rejection handler. function eventualAdd(a, b) {     return Q.spread([a, b], function (a, b) {         return a + b;     }) } But spread calls all initially, so you can skip it in chains. return getUsername() .then(function (username) {     return [username, getUser(username)]; }) .spread(function (username, user) { }); The all function returns a promise for an array of values. When this promise is fulfilled, the array contains the fulfillment values of the original promises, in the same order as those promises. If one of the given promises is rejected, the returned promise is immediately rejected, not waiting for the rest of the batch. If you want to wait for all of the promises to either be fulfilled or rejected, you can use allSettled. Q.allSettled(promises) .then(function (results) {     results.forEach(function (result) {         if (result.state === ""fulfilled"") {             var value = result.value;         } else {             var reason = result.reason;         }     }); }); The any function accepts an array of promises and returns a promise that is fulfilled by the first given promise to be fulfilled, or rejected if all of the given promises are rejected. Q.any(promises) .then(function (first) {     // Any of the promises was fulfilled. }, function (error) {     // All of the promises were rejected. }); Sequences If you have a number of promise-producing functions that need to be run sequentially, you can of course do so manually: return foo(initialVal).then(bar).then(baz).then(qux); However, if you want to run a dynamically constructed sequence of functions, you'll want something like this: var funcs = [foo, bar, baz, qux];  var result = Q(initialVal); funcs.forEach(function (f) {     result = result.then(f); }); return result; You can make this slightly more compact using reduce: return funcs.reduce(function (soFar, f) {     return soFar.then(f); }, Q(initialVal)); Or, you could use the ultra-compact version: return funcs.reduce(Q.when, Q(initialVal)); Handling Errors One sometimes-unintuitive aspect of promises is that if you throw an exception in the fulfillment handler, it will not be caught by the error handler. return foo() .then(function (value) {     throw new Error(""Can't bar.""); }, function (error) {     // We only get here if ""foo"" fails }); To see why this is, consider the parallel between promises and try/catch. We are try-ing to execute foo(): the error handler represents a catch for foo(), while the fulfillment handler represents code that happens after the try/catch block. That code then needs its own try/catch block. In terms of promises, this means chaining your rejection handler: return foo() .then(function (value) {     throw new Error(""Can't bar.""); }) .fail(function (error) {     // We get here with either foo's error or bar's error }); Progress Notification It's possible for promises to report their progress, e.g. for tasks that take a long time like a file upload. Not all promises will implement progress notifications, but for those that do, you can consume the progress values using a third parameter to then: return uploadFile() .then(function () {     // Success uploading the file }, function (err) {     // There was an error, and we get the reason for error }, function (progress) {     // We get notified of the upload's progress as it is executed }); Like fail, Q also provides a shorthand for progress callbacks called progress: return uploadFile().progress(function (progress) {     // We get notified of the upload's progress }); The End When you get to the end of a chain of promises, you should either return the last promise or end the chain. Since handlers catch errors, it’s an unfortunate pattern that the exceptions can go unobserved. So, either return it, return foo() .then(function () {     return ""bar""; }); Or, end it. foo() .then(function () {     return ""bar""; }) .done(); Ending a promise chain makes sure that, if an error doesn’t get handled before the end, it will get rethrown and reported. This is a stopgap. We are exploring ways to make unhandled errors visible without any explicit handling. The Beginning Everything above assumes you get a promise from somewhere else. This is the common case. Every once in a while, you will need to create a promise from scratch. Using Q.fcall You can create a promise from a value using Q.fcall. This returns a promise for 10. return Q.fcall(function () {     return 10; }); You can also use fcall to get a promise for an exception. return Q.fcall(function () {     throw new Error(""Can't do it""); }); As the name implies, fcall can call functions, or even promised functions. This uses the eventualAdd function above to add two numbers. return Q.fcall(eventualAdd, 2, 2); Using Deferreds If you have to interface with asynchronous functions that are callback-based instead of promise-based, Q provides a few shortcuts (like Q.nfcall and friends). But much of the time, the solution will be to use deferreds. var deferred = Q.defer(); FS.readFile(""foo.txt"", ""utf-8"", function (error, text) {     if (error) {         deferred.reject(new Error(error));     } else {         deferred.resolve(text);     } }); return deferred.promise; Note that a deferred can be resolved with a value or a promise. The reject function is a shorthand for resolving with a rejected promise. // this: deferred.reject(new Error(""Can't do it""));  // is shorthand for: var rejection = Q.fcall(function () {     throw new Error(""Can't do it""); }); deferred.resolve(rejection); This is a simplified implementation of Q.delay. function delay(ms) {     var deferred = Q.defer();     setTimeout(deferred.resolve, ms);     return deferred.promise; } This is a simplified implementation of Q.timeout function timeout(promise, ms) {     var deferred = Q.defer();     Q.when(promise, deferred.resolve);     delay(ms).then(function () {         deferred.reject(new Error(""Timed out""));     });     return deferred.promise; } Finally, you can send a progress notification to the promise with deferred.notify. For illustration, this is a wrapper for XML HTTP requests in the browser. Note that a more thorough implementation would be in order in practice. function requestOkText(url) {     var request = new XMLHttpRequest();     var deferred = Q.defer();      request.open(""GET"", url, true);     request.onload = onload;     request.onerror = onerror;     request.onprogress = onprogress;     request.send();      function onload() {         if (request.status === 200) {             deferred.resolve(request.responseText);         } else {             deferred.reject(new Error(""Status code was "" + request.status));         }     }      function onerror() {         deferred.reject(new Error(""Can't XHR "" + JSON.stringify(url)));     }      function onprogress(event) {         deferred.notify(event.loaded / event.total);     }      return deferred.promise; } Below is an example of how to use this requestOkText function: requestOkText(""http://localhost:3000"") .then(function (responseText) {     // If the HTTP response returns 200 OK, log the response text.     console.log(responseText); }, function (error) {     // If there's an error or a non-200 status code, log the error.     console.error(error); }, function (progress) {     // Log the progress as it comes in.     console.log(""Request progress: "" + Math.round(progress * 100) + ""%""); }); Using Q.Promise This is an alternative promise-creation API that has the same power as the deferred concept, but without introducing another conceptual entity. Rewriting the requestOkText example above using Q.Promise: function requestOkText(url) {     return Q.Promise(function(resolve, reject, notify) {         var request = new XMLHttpRequest();          request.open(""GET"", url, true);         request.onload = onload;         request.onerror = onerror;         request.onprogress = onprogress;         request.send();          function onload() {             if (request.status === 200) {                 resolve(request.responseText);             } else {                 reject(new Error(""Status code was "" + request.status));             }         }          function onerror() {             reject(new Error(""Can't XHR "" + JSON.stringify(url)));         }          function onprogress(event) {             notify(event.loaded / event.total);         }     }); } If requestOkText were to throw an exception, the returned promise would be rejected with that thrown exception as the rejection reason. The Middle If you are using a function that may return a promise, but just might return a value if it doesn’t need to defer, you can use the “static” methods of the Q library. The when function is the static equivalent for then. return Q.when(valueOrPromise, function (value) { }, function (error) { }); All of the other methods on a promise have static analogs with the same name. The following are equivalent: return Q.all([a, b]); return Q.fcall(function () {     return [a, b]; }) .all(); When working with promises provided by other libraries, you should convert it to a Q promise. Not all promise libraries make the same guarantees as Q and certainly don’t provide all of the same methods. Most libraries only provide a partially functional then method. This thankfully is all we need to turn them into vibrant Q promises. return Q($.ajax(...)) .then(function () { }); If there is any chance that the promise you receive is not a Q promise as provided by your library, you should wrap it using a Q function. You can even use Q.invoke as a shorthand. return Q.invoke($, 'ajax', ...) .then(function () { }); Over the Wire A promise can serve as a proxy for another object, even a remote object. There are methods that allow you to optimistically manipulate properties or call functions. All of these interactions return promises, so they can be chained. direct manipulation         using a promise as a proxy --------------------------  ------------------------------- value.foo                   promise.get(""foo"") value.foo = value           promise.put(""foo"", value) delete value.foo            promise.del(""foo"") value.foo(...args)          promise.post(""foo"", [args]) value.foo(...args)          promise.invoke(""foo"", ...args) value(...args)              promise.fapply([args]) value(...args)              promise.fcall(...args)  If the promise is a proxy for a remote object, you can shave round-trips by using these functions instead of then. To take advantage of promises for remote objects, check out Q-Connection. Even in the case of non-remote objects, these methods can be used as shorthand for particularly-simple fulfillment handlers. For example, you can replace return Q.fcall(function () {     return [{ foo: ""bar"" }, { foo: ""baz"" }]; }) .then(function (value) {     return value[0].foo; }); with return Q.fcall(function () {     return [{ foo: ""bar"" }, { foo: ""baz"" }]; }) .get(0) .get(""foo""); Adapting Node If you're working with functions that make use of the Node.js callback pattern, where callbacks are in the form of function(err, result), Q provides a few useful utility functions for converting between them. The most straightforward are probably Q.nfcall and Q.nfapply (""Node function call/apply"") for calling Node.js-style functions and getting back a promise: return Q.nfcall(FS.readFile, ""foo.txt"", ""utf-8""); return Q.nfapply(FS.readFile, [""foo.txt"", ""utf-8""]); If you are working with methods, instead of simple functions, you can easily run in to the usual problems where passing a method to another function—like Q.nfcall—""un-binds"" the method from its owner. To avoid this, you can either use Function.prototype.bind or some nice shortcut methods we provide: return Q.ninvoke(redisClient, ""get"", ""user:1:id""); return Q.npost(redisClient, ""get"", [""user:1:id""]); You can also create reusable wrappers with Q.denodeify or Q.nbind: var readFile = Q.denodeify(FS.readFile); return readFile(""foo.txt"", ""utf-8"");  var redisClientGet = Q.nbind(redisClient.get, redisClient); return redisClientGet(""user:1:id""); Finally, if you're working with raw deferred objects, there is a makeNodeResolver method on deferreds that can be handy: var deferred = Q.defer(); FS.readFile(""foo.txt"", ""utf-8"", deferred.makeNodeResolver()); return deferred.promise; Long Stack Traces Q comes with optional support for “long stack traces,” wherein the stack property of Error rejection reasons is rewritten to be traced along asynchronous jumps instead of stopping at the most recent one. As an example: function theDepthsOfMyProgram() {   Q.delay(100).done(function explode() {     throw new Error(""boo!"");   }); }  theDepthsOfMyProgram(); usually would give a rather unhelpful stack trace looking something like Error: boo!     at explode (/path/to/test.js:3:11)     at _fulfilled (/path/to/test.js:q:54)     at resolvedValue.promiseDispatch.done (/path/to/q.js:823:30)     at makePromise.promise.promiseDispatch (/path/to/q.js:496:13)     at pending (/path/to/q.js:397:39)     at process.startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback (node.js:244:9)  But, if you turn this feature on by setting Q.longStackSupport = true; then the above code gives a nice stack trace to the tune of Error: boo!     at explode (/path/to/test.js:3:11) From previous event:     at theDepthsOfMyProgram (/path/to/test.js:2:16)     at Object.<anonymous> (/path/to/test.js:7:1)  Note how you can see the function that triggered the async operation in the stack trace! This is very helpful for debugging, as otherwise you end up getting only the first line, plus a bunch of Q internals, with no sign of where the operation started. In node.js, this feature can also be enabled through the Q_DEBUG environment variable: Q_DEBUG=1 node server.js  This will enable long stack support in every instance of Q. This feature does come with somewhat-serious performance and memory overhead, however. If you're working with lots of promises, or trying to scale a server to many users, you should probably keep it off. But in development, go for it!

How to install Simply copy or link the lib/step.js file into your $HOME/.node_libraries folder. How to use The step library exports a single function I call Step. It accepts any number of functions as arguments and runs them in serial order using the passed in this context as the callback to the next step. Step(   function readSelf() {     fs.readFile(__filename, this);   },   function capitalize(err, text) {     if (err) throw err;     return text.toUpperCase();   },   function showIt(err, newText) {     if (err) throw err;     console.log(newText);   } );  Notice that we pass in this as the callback to fs.readFile. When the file read completes, step will send the result as the arguments to the next function in the chain. Then in the capitalize function we're doing synchronous work so we can simple return the new value and Step will route it as if we called the callback. The first parameter is reserved for errors since this is the node standard. Also any exceptions thrown are caught and passed as the first argument to the next function. As long as you don't nest callback functions inline your main functions this prevents there from ever being any uncaught exceptions. This is very important for long running node.JS servers since a single uncaught exception can bring the whole server down. Also there is support for parallel actions: Step(   // Loads two files in parallel   function loadStuff() {     fs.readFile(__filename, this.parallel());     fs.readFile(""/etc/passwd"", this.parallel());   },   // Show the result when done   function showStuff(err, code, users) {     if (err) throw err;     console.log(code);     console.log(users);   } )  Here we pass this.parallel() instead of this as the callback. It internally keeps track of the number of callbacks issued and preserves their order then giving the result to the next step after all have finished. If there is an error in any of the parallel actions, it will be passed as the first argument to the next step. Also you can use group with a dynamic number of common tasks. Step(   function readDir() {     fs.readdir(__dirname, this);   },   function readFiles(err, results) {     if (err) throw err;     // Create a new group     var group = this.group();     results.forEach(function (filename) {       if (/\.js$/.test(filename)) {         fs.readFile(__dirname + ""/"" + filename, 'utf8', group());       }     });   },   function showAll(err , files) {     if (err) throw err;     console.dir(files);   } );  Note that we both call this.group() and group(). The first reserves a slot in the parameters of the next step, then calling group() generates the individual callbacks and increments the internal counter.

Inspired by async and lodash. Methods are implemented individually and not as part of a whole. That design helps when considering to export functions individually. If you need all the methods in async, then stick with it. Otherwise, you might want to check λ out! Feature requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Executes tasks concurrently. Results get passed as an array or hash to an optional done callback. Task order is preserved in results. You can set a concurrency cap, and it's uncapped by default. tasks Collection of functions with the (cb) signature.

Falsy will remove it in the results done Optional function with the (err, results) signature λ.filter({ thing: 900, another: 23, foo: 69 }, function (item, cb) {   setTimeout(function () {     cb(null, item % 23 === 0);   }, item); }, function (err, results) {   console.log(results);   <- { another: 23, foo: 69 } }); Back to top λ.filter.series(items, iterator, done?) Effectively an alias for λ.filter(items, 1, iterator, done?). Back to top λ.queue(worker, cap=1) Used to create a job queue. worker(job, done) Function to process jobs in the queue job The current job done Needs to be called when processing for current job is done cap Optional concurrency level, defaults to 1 (serial) Returns a queue you can push or unshift jobs to. You can pause and resume the queue by hand. push(job, done?) Array of jobs or an individual job object. Enqueue those jobs, continue processing (unless paused). Optional callback to run when each job is completed unshift(job, done?) Array of jobs or an individual job object. Add jobs to the top of the queue, continue processing (unless paused). Optional callback to run when each job is completed pending Property. Jobs that haven't started processing yet length Short-hand for pending.length, only works if getters can be defined pause() Stop processing jobs. Those already being processed will run to completion resume() Start processing jobs again, after a pause() on('drain', fn) Execute fn whenever there's no more pending (or running) jobs and processing is requested. Processing can be requested using resume, push, or unshift var q = λ.queue(worker);  function worker (job, done) {   console.log(job);   done(null); }  q.push('job', function () {   console.log('this job is done!'); });  q.push(['some', 'more'], function () {   console.log('one of these jobs is done!'); });  q.on('drain', function () {   console.log('all done!');   // if you enqueue more tasks now, then drain   // will fire again when pending.length reaches 0 });  // <- 'this job is done!' // <- 'one of these jobs is done!' // <- 'one of these jobs is done!' // <- 'all done!' Back to top λ.emitter(thing={}, options={}) Augments thing with the event emitter methods listed below. If thing isn't provided, an event emitter is created for you. Emitter methods return the thing for chaining. thing Optional. Writable JavaScript object emit(type, ...arguments) Emits an event of type type, passing any ...arguments emitterSnapshot(type) Returns a function you can call, passing any ...arguments on(type, fn) Registers an event listener fn for type events once(type, fn) Same as on, but the listener is discarded after one callback off(type, fn) Unregisters an event listener fn from type events off(type) Unregisters all event listeners from type events off() Unregisters all event listeners The emitterSnapshot(type) method lets you remove all event listeners before emitting an event that might add more event listeners which shouldn't be removed. In the example below, thing removes all events and then emits a 'destroy' event, resulting in a 'create' event handler being attached. If we just used thing.off() after emitting the destroy event, the 'create' event handler would be wiped out too (or the consumer would have to know implementation details as to avoid this issue). var thing = λ.emitter();  thing.on('foo', foo); thing.on('bar', bar); thing.on('destroy', function () {   thing.on('create', reinitialize); });  var destroy = thing.emitterSnapshot('destroy'); thing.off(); destroy(); The emitter can be configured with the following options, too. async Debounce listeners asynchronously. By default they're executed in sequence. throws Throw an exception if an error event is emitted and no listeners are defined. Defaults to true. var thing = λ.emitter(); // also, λ.emitter({ foo: 'bar' })  thing.once('something', function (level) {   console.log('something FIRST TROLL'); });  thing.on('something', function (level) {   console.log('something level ' + level); });  thing.emit('something', 4); thing.emit('something', 5); // <- 'something FIRST TROLL' // <- 'something level 4' // <- 'something level 5' Returns thing. Events of type error have a special behavior. λ.emitter will throw if there are no error listeners when an error event is emitted. This behavior can be turned off setting throws: false in the options. var thing = { foo: 'bar' };  λ.emitter(thing);  thing.emit('error', 'foo'); <- throws 'foo' If an 'error' listener is registered, then it'll work just like any other event type. var thing = { foo: 'bar' };  λ.emitter(thing);  thing.on('error', function (err) {   console.log(err); });  thing.emit('error', 'foo'); <- 'foo' Back to top λ.curry(fn, ...arguments) Returns a function bound with some arguments and a next callback. λ.curry(fn, 1, 3, 5); // <- function (next) { fn(1, 3, 5, next); } Back to top Comparison with async async λ Aimed at Noders Tailored for browsers Arrays for some, collections for others Collections for everyone! apply curry parallel concurrent parallelLimit concurrent mapSeries map.series More comprehensive More focused ~29.6k (minified, uncompressed) ~2.7k (minified, uncompressed) λ isn't meant to be a replacement for async.

To get a better handle on how promise flows look and how they can be helpful, there are a couple examples below (using commonjs). This first example will print ""hello world!!!!"" if all went well, or ""drat!"" if there was a problem. It also uses rest to make an ajax request to a (fictional) external service. var rest = require('rest');  fetchRemoteGreeting()     .then(addExclamation)     .catch(handleError)     .done(function(greeting) {         console.log(greeting);     });  function fetchRemoteGreeting() {     // returns a when.js promise for 'hello world'     return rest('http://example.com/greeting'); }  function addExclamation(greeting) {     return greeting + '!!!!' }  function handleError(e) {     return 'drat!'; } The second example shows off the power that comes with when's promise logic. Here, we get an array of numbers from a remote source and reduce them. The example will print 150 if all went well, and if there was a problem will print a full stack trace. var when = require('when'); var rest = require('rest');  when.reduce(when.map(getRemoteNumberList(), times10), sum)     .done(function(result) {         console.log(result);     });  function getRemoteNumberList() {     // Get a remote array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]     return rest('http://example.com/numbers').then(JSON.parse); }  function sum(x, y) { return x + y; } function times10(x) {return x * 10; } License Licensed under MIT.

And that's make it awesome. You can prototype your objects with this and you will have support to events. Also it can be used as prototype of a shim to EventTarget in non-modern browsers. Because it's compatible with ES3. Installation To use in your browser, you just need to add the script before the place you are using it. <script src=""ObjectEventTarget.js""></script> To install on NodeJS: npm install objecteventtarget --save Projects using it Chronometer.js This is just a chronometer constructor in JavaScript, that uses ObjectEventTarget as prototype to support events listeners, demo page. Entity This is a JavaScript micro lib that allows you to create entity with events of attribute manipulation. How to use Prototype your constructor like this: function Foo(){} Foo.prototype = ObjectEventTarget.prototype; Now you have access to EventTarget methods, so let's implement a mehtod that dispatch a event type: function AsyncFoo(){   this.bar = function(){     if (this.dispatchEvent({type: 'beforebar'})){       console.log('The beforebar default behaviour');     }     // Do something then...     var self = this;     setTimeout(function (){       // I'm async       if (self.dispatchEvent(new ObjectEvent('bar', {cacelable: true})){         console.log('The bar default behaviour');       };       console.log('End of bar method');     }, 1e3);   } } AsyncFoo.prototype = ObjectEventTarget.prototype; Now you can add some events to you AsyncFoo instances like this: instanceOne = new AsyncFoo(); instanceOne.addEventListener('beforebar', function (){   console.log('You triggered bar from a AsyncFoo instance'); }); instanceOne.addEventListener('bar', function (event){   event.preventDefault();   console.log('The method bar was async and finished calling ""bar"" event type'); }); instanceOne.bar(); // #1: You triggered bar from a AsyncFoo instance // #2: The beforebar default behaviour // after a seccond // #3: The method bar was async and finished calling ""bar"" event type // #4: End of bar method The rest you know... Using with NodeJS After installing on NodeJS you can use require('objecteventtarget') to get a object with ObjectEventTarget and ObjectEvent. Example: var ObjectEventTarget = require('objecteventtarget').ObjectEventTarget; var ObjectEvent = require('objecteventtarget').ObjectEvent;  /* ... your code implemetation ... */ Methods The methods aren't enumerables, but only for modern-browsers and nodejs, if you are supporting IE9- if you use for in in your object, make sure to check the hasOwnProperty, because if not, you will touch the methods. addEventListener( eventType, callback ) removeEventListener( eventType, callback ) dispatchEvent( event ) The event can be any object that has ""type"" propertie as string, recomends to use new ObjectEvent('type name'). Events You can use new ObjectEvent('type name', options) to generate a event compatible with non-modern browsers and Nodejs. Or you can just use a literal object with at least type property aka {type: 'type name'}. I don't encorage you to use the browser Event, but it will work with it events like Event, CustomEvent and anyone that prototypes Event, also you can use modern constructor or non-moderns, it will work where the browser supports it, but when using this way, it will never change the path property. There is properties in a event that after start the type dispatch callback queue, becomes read-only properties, you should not try to force change their values. type string (read) the name/type of the event immediatePropagationStopped boolean (read/write) when a callback stoped the event chain (recomend to use the Event or CustomEvent constructor to use this) cancelable boolean (read) define if the event can be cancelable when preventDefault is triggered defaultPrevented boolean (read/write) when true will set the returnValue to be false if the event is cancelable returnValue boolean (read) same value that is returned by the dispatchEvent method eventPhase number (read) expose the phase where the event is been triggered path array (read) a array with the objects in the orther that the event has triggered in it phases Events Methods When not available, because you probably used a literal object in the dispatchEvent, the event methods will be added to your object by mixing the methods in it. initEvent() executed before the first callback in the queue be called, also keeps the integrity of your object with every required property and method been setup preventDefault() will set defaultPrevented true when cancelable is true stopImmediatePropagation() will stop the immidiate propagation of the callbacks of the event type in the current queue Events Error Handling When a callback from a event type throw an error, it will result in same as stopImmediatePropagation. The throw will be show in your console, but will not stop your code flow that is expecting by the dispatchEvent result. Projects Using it Chronometer.js A chronometer constructor. Overloading internals The ObjectEventTarget let you to overload it internal constructors to you personalize how it should work in your enviroment. EventsMap( type, callback ) is created to store the events and callbacks, where type must become a property where contains a array of callbacks. If the instance exists it will decorate with new types with array and it callbacks. WeakMap is used to map the instances to it EventsMap, and must contain the methods get( object ), set( object, value ), has( object ), delete( object ). To do the overloading, before the lib is loaded you must create a object called ObjectEventTarget with the property options. window.ObjectEventTarget = {   options: {     EventsMap: MyCustomEventsMap,     WeakMap: MyCustomWeakMap   } }; Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Routing is the process of determining what code to run when a URL is requested. Motivation A routing library that works in both the browser and node.js environments with as few differences as possible. Simplifies the development of Single Page Apps and Node.js applications. Dependency free (doesn't require jQuery or Express, etc). Status Features Client-Side Routing Server-Side HTTP Routing Server-Side CLI Routing Usage API Documentation Frequently Asked Questions Building client-side script Run the provided CLI script. ./bin/build Client-side Routing It simply watches the hash of the URL to determine what to do, for example: http://foo.com/#/bar  Client-side routing (aka hash-routing) allows you to specify some information about the state of the application using the URL. So that when the user visits a specific URL, the application can be transformed accordingly. Here is a simple example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html>   <head>     <meta charset=""utf-8"">     <title>A Gentle Introduction</title>      <script       src=""https://rawgit.com/flatiron/director/master/build/director.min.js"">     </script>      <script>       var author = function () { console.log(""author""); };       var books = function () { console.log(""books""); };       var viewBook = function (bookId) {         console.log(""viewBook: bookId is populated: "" + bookId);       };        var routes = {         '/author': author,         '/books': [books, function() {           console.log(""An inline route handler."");         }],         '/books/view/:bookId': viewBook       };        var router = Router(routes);        router.init();     </script>   </head>    <body>     <ul>       <li><a href=""#/author"">#/author</a></li>       <li><a href=""#/books"">#/books</a></li>       <li><a href=""#/books/view/1"">#/books/view/1</a></li>     </ul>   </body> </html> Director works great with your favorite DOM library, such as jQuery. <!DOCTYPE html> <html>   <head>     <meta charset=""utf-8"">     <title>A Gentle Introduction 2</title>      <script       src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"">     </script>      <script       src=""https://rawgit.com/flatiron/director/master/build/director.min.js"">     </script>      <script>     $('document').ready(function() {       //       // create some functions to be executed when       // the correct route is issued by the user.       //       var showAuthorInfo = function () { console.log(""showAuthorInfo""); };       var listBooks = function () { console.log(""listBooks""); };        var allroutes = function() {         var route = window.location.hash.slice(2);         var sections = $('section');         var section;          section = sections.filter('[data-route=' + route + ']');          if (section.length) {           sections.hide(250);           section.show(250);         }       };        //       // define the routing table.       //       var routes = {         '/author': showAuthorInfo,         '/books': listBooks       };        //       // instantiate the router.       //       var router = Router(routes);        //       // a global configuration setting.       //       router.configure({         on: allroutes       });        router.init();     });     </script>   </head>    <body>     <section data-route=""author"">Author Name</section>     <section data-route=""books"">Book1, Book2, Book3</section>     <ul>       <li><a href=""#/author"">#/author</a></li>       <li><a href=""#/books"">#/books</a></li>     </ul>   </body> </html> You can find a browser-specific build of director here which has all of the server code stripped away. Server-Side HTTP Routing Director handles routing for HTTP requests similar to journey or express:   //   // require the native http module, as well as director.   //   var http = require('http'),       director = require('director');    //   // create some logic to be routed to.   //   function helloWorld() {     this.res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })     this.res.end('hello world');   }    //   // define a routing table.   //   var router = new director.http.Router({     '/hello': {       get: helloWorld     }   });    //   // setup a server and when there is a request, dispatch the   // route that was requested in the request object.   //   var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {     router.dispatch(req, res, function (err) {       if (err) {         res.writeHead(404);         res.end();       }     });   });    //   // You can also do ad-hoc routing, similar to `journey` or `express`.   // This can be done with a string or a regexp.   //   router.get('/bonjour', helloWorld);   router.get(/hola/, helloWorld);    //   // set the server to listen on port `8080`.   //   server.listen(8080); See Also: Auto-generated Node.js API Clients for routers using Director-Reflector RESTful Resource routing using restful HTML / Plain Text views of routers using Director-Explorer Server-Side CLI Routing Director supports Command Line Interface routing. Routes for cli options are based on command line input (i.e. process.argv) instead of a URL.   var director = require('director');    var router = new director.cli.Router();    router.on('create', function () {     console.log('create something');   });    router.on(/destroy/, function () {     console.log('destroy something');   });    // You will need to dispatch the cli arguments yourself   router.dispatch('on', process.argv.slice(2).join(' ')); Using the cli router, you can dispatch commands by passing them as a string. For example, if this example is in a file called foo.js: $ node foo.js create create something $ node foo.js destroy destroy something API Documentation Constructor Routing Table Adhoc Routing Scoped Routing Routing Events Configuration URL Matching URL Parameters Wildcard routes Route Recursion Async Routing Resources History API Instance Methods Attach Properties to this HTTP Streaming and Body Parsing Constructor   var router = Router(routes); Routing Table An object literal that contains nested route definitions. A potentially nested set of key/value pairs. The keys in the object literal represent each potential part of the URL. The values in the object literal contain references to the functions that should be associated with them. bark and meow are two functions that you have defined in your code.   //   // Assign routes to an object literal.   //   var routes = {     //     // a route which assigns the function `bark`.     //     '/dog': bark,     //     // a route which assigns the functions `meow` and `scratch`.     //     '/cat': [meow, scratch]   };    //   // Instantiate the router.   //   var router = Router(routes); Adhoc Routing When developing large client-side or server-side applications it is not always possible to define routes in one location. Usually individual decoupled components register their own routes with the application router. We refer to this as Adhoc Routing. Lets take a look at the API director exposes for adhoc routing: Client-side Routing   var router = new Router().init();    router.on('/some/resource', function () {     //     // Do something on `/#/some/resource`     //   }); HTTP Routing   var router = new director.http.Router();    router.get(/\/some\/resource/, function () {     //     // Do something on an GET to `/some/resource`     //   }); Scoped Routing In large web appliations, both Client-side and Server-side, routes are often scoped within a few individual resources. Director exposes a simple way to do this for Adhoc Routing scenarios:   var router = new director.http.Router();    //   // Create routes inside the `/users` scope.   //   router.path(/\/users\/(\w+)/, function () {     //     // The `this` context of the function passed to `.path()`     // is the Router itself.     //      this.post(function (id) {       //       // Create the user with the specified `id`.       //     });      this.get(function (id) {       //       // Retreive the user with the specified `id`.       //     });      this.get(/\/friends/, function (id) {       //       // Get the friends for the user with the specified `id`.       //     });   }); Routing Events In director, a ""routing event"" is a named property in the Routing Table which can be assigned to a function or an Array of functions to be called when a route is matched in a call to router.dispatch(). on: A function or Array of functions to execute when the route is matched. before: A function or Array of functions to execute before calling the on method(s). Client-side only after: A function or Array of functions to execute when leaving a particular route. once: A function or Array of functions to execute only once for a particular route. Configuration Given the flexible nature of director there are several options available for both the Client-side and Server-side. These options can be set using the .configure() method:   var router = new director.Router(routes).configure(options); The options are: recurse: Controls route recursion. Use forward, backward, or false. Default is false Client-side, and backward Server-side. strict: If set to false, then trailing slashes (or other delimiters) are allowed in routes. Default is true. async: Controls async routing. Use true or false. Default is false. delimiter: Character separator between route fragments. Default is /. notfound: A function to call if no route is found on a call to router.dispatch(). on: A function (or list of functions) to call on every call to router.dispatch() when a route is found. before: A function (or list of functions) to call before every call to router.dispatch() when a route is found. Client-side only resource: An object to which string-based routes will be bound. This can be especially useful for late-binding to route functions (such as async client-side requires). after: A function (or list of functions) to call when a given route is no longer the active route. html5history: If set to true and client supports pushState(), then uses HTML5 History API instead of hash fragments. See History API for more information. run_handler_in_init: If html5history is enabled, the route handler by default is executed upon Router.init() since with real URIs the router can not know if it should call a route handler or not. Setting this to false disables the route handler initial execution. convert_hash_in_init: If html5history is enabled, the window.location hash by default is converted to a route upon Router.init() since with canonical URIs the router can not know if it should convert the hash to a route or not. Setting this to false disables the hash conversion on router initialisation. URL Matching   var router = Router({     //     // given the route '/dog/yella'.     //     '/dog': {       '/:color': {         //         // this function will return the value 'yella'.         //         on: function (color) { console.log(color) }       }     }   }); Routes can sometimes become very complex, simple/:tokens don't always suffice. Director supports regular expressions inside the route names. The values captured from the regular expressions are passed to your listener function.   var router = Router({     //     // given the route '/hello/world'.     //     '/hello': {       '/(\\w+)': {         //         // this function will return the value 'world'.         //         on: function (who) { console.log(who) }       }     }   });   var router = Router({     //     // given the route '/hello/world/johny/appleseed'.     //     '/hello': {       '/world/?([^\/]*)\/([^\/]*)/?': function (a, b) {         console.log(a, b);       }     }   }); URL Parameters When you are using the same route fragments it is more descriptive to define these fragments by name and then use them in your Routing Table or Adhoc Routes. Consider a simple example where a userId is used repeatedly.   //   // Create a router. This could also be director.cli.Router() or   // director.http.Router().   //   var router = new director.Router();    //   // A route could be defined using the `userId` explicitly.   //   router.on(/([\w-_]+)/, function (userId) { });    //   // Define a shorthand for this fragment called `userId`.   //   router.param('userId', /([\\w\\-]+)/);    //   // Now multiple routes can be defined with the same   // regular expression.   //   router.on('/anything/:userId', function (userId) { });   router.on('/something-else/:userId', function (userId) { }); Wildcard routes It is possible to define wildcard routes, so that /foo and /foo/a/b/c routes to the same handler, and gets passed """" and ""a/b/c"" respectively.   router.on(""/foo/?((\w|.)*)""), function (path) { }); Route Recursion Can be assigned the value of forward or backward. The recurse option will determine the order in which to fire the listeners that are associated with your routes. If this option is NOT specified or set to null, then only the listeners associated with an exact match will be fired. No recursion, with the URL /dog/angry   var routes = {     '/dog': {       '/angry': {         //         // Only this method will be fired.         //         on: growl       },       on: bark     }   };    var router = Router(routes); Recursion set to backward, with the URL /dog/angry   var routes = {     '/dog': {       '/angry': {         //         // This method will be fired first.         //         on: growl       },       //       // This method will be fired second.       //       on: bark     }   };    var router = Router(routes).configure({ recurse: 'backward' }); Recursion set to forward, with the URL /dog/angry   var routes = {     '/dog': {       '/angry': {         //         // This method will be fired second.         //         on: growl       },       //       // This method will be fired first.       //       on: bark     }   };    var router = Router(routes).configure({ recurse: 'forward' }); Breaking out of recursion, with the URL /dog/angry   var routes = {     '/dog': {       '/angry': {         //         // This method will be fired first.         //         on: function() { return false; }       },       //       // This method will not be fired.       //       on: bark     }   };    //   // This feature works in reverse with recursion set to true.   //   var router = Router(routes).configure({ recurse: 'backward' }); Async Routing Before diving into how Director exposes async routing, you should understand Route Recursion. At it's core route recursion is about evaluating a series of functions gathered when traversing the Routing Table. Normally this series of functions is evaluated synchronously. In async routing, these functions are evaluated asynchronously. Async routing can be extremely useful both on the client-side and the server-side: Client-side: To ensure an animation or other async operations (such as HTTP requests for authentication) have completed before continuing evaluation of a route. Server-side: To ensure arbitrary async operations (such as performing authentication) have completed before continuing the evaluation of a route. The method signatures for route functions in synchronous and asynchronous evaluation are different: async route functions take an additional next() callback. Synchronous route functions   var router = new director.Router();    router.on('/:foo/:bar/:bazz', function (foo, bar, bazz) {     //     // Do something asynchronous with `foo`, `bar`, and `bazz`.     //   }); Asynchronous route functions   var router = new director.http.Router().configure({ async: true });    router.on('/:foo/:bar/:bazz', function (foo, bar, bazz, next) {     //     // Go do something async, and determine that routing should stop     //     next(false);   }); Resources Available on the Client-side only. An object literal containing functions. If a host object is specified, your route definitions can provide string literals that represent the function names inside the host object. A host object can provide the means for better encapsulation and design.   var router = Router({      '/hello': {       '/usa': 'americas',       '/china': 'asia'     }    }).configure({ resource: container }).init();    var container = {     americas: function() { return true; },     china: function() { return true; }   };  History API Available on the Client-side only. Director supports using HTML5 History API instead of hash fragments for navigation. To use the API, pass {html5history: true} to configure(). Use of the API is enabled only if the client supports pushState(). Using the API gives you cleaner URIs but they come with a cost. Unlike with hash fragments your route URIs must exist. When the client enters a page, say http://foo.com/bar/baz, the web server must respond with something meaningful. Usually this means that your web server checks the URI points to something that, in a sense, exists, and then serves the client the JavaScript application. If you're after a single-page application you can not use plain old <a href=""/bar/baz""> tags for navigation anymore. When such link is clicked, web browsers try to ask for the resource from server which is not of course desired for a single-page application. Instead you need to use e.g. click handlers and call the setRoute() method yourself. Attach Properties To this Available in the http router only. Generally, the this object bound to route handlers, will contain the request in this.req and the response in this.res. One may attach additional properties to this with the router.attach method:   var director = require('director');    var router = new director.http.Router().configure(options);    //   // Attach properties to `this`   //   router.attach(function () {     this.data = [1,2,3];   });    //   // Access properties attached to `this` in your routes!   //   router.get('/hello', function () {     this.res.writeHead(200, { 'content-type': 'text/plain' });      //     // Response will be `[1,2,3]`!     //     this.res.end(this.data);   }); This API may be used to attach convenience methods to the this context of route handlers. HTTP Streaming and Body Parsing When you are performing HTTP routing there are two common scenarios: Buffer the request body and parse it according to the Content-Type header (usually application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded). Stream the request body by manually calling .pipe or listening to the data and end events. By default director.http.Router() will attempt to parse either the .chunks or .body properties set on the request parameter passed to router.dispatch(request, response, callback). The router instance will also wait for the end event before firing any routes. Default Behavior   var director = require('director');    var router = new director.http.Router();    router.get('/', function () {     //     // This will not work, because all of the data     // events and the end event have already fired.     //     this.req.on('data', function (chunk) {       console.log(chunk)     });   }); In flatiron, director is used in conjunction with union which uses a BufferedStream proxy to the raw http.Request instance. union will set the req.chunks property for you and director will automatically parse the body. If you wish to perform this buffering yourself directly with director you can use a simple request handler in your http server:   var http = require('http'),       director = require('director');    var router = new director.http.Router();    var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {     req.chunks = [];     req.on('data', function (chunk) {       req.chunks.push(chunk.toString());     });      router.dispatch(req, res, function (err) {       if (err) {         res.writeHead(404);         res.end();       }        console.log('Served ' + req.url);     });   });    router.post('/', function () {     this.res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' })     this.res.end(JSON.stringify(this.req.body));   }); Streaming Support If you wish to get access to the request stream before the end event is fired, you can pass the { stream: true } options to the route.   var director = require('director');    var router = new director.http.Router();    router.get('/', { stream: true }, function () {     //     // This will work because the route handler is invoked     // immediately without waiting for the `end` event.     //     this.req.on('data', function (chunk) {       console.log(chunk);     });   }); Instance methods configure(options) options {Object}: Options to configure this instance with.

API page(path, callback[, callback ...]) Defines a route mapping path to the given callback(s). Each callback is invoked with two arguments, context and next. Much like Express invoking next will call the next registered callback with the given path. page('/', user.list) page('/user/:id', user.load, user.show) page('/user/:id/edit', user.load, user.edit) page('*', notfound) Under certain conditions, links will be disregarded and will not be dispatched, such as: Links that are not of the same origin Links with the download attribute Links with the target attribute Links with the rel=""external"" attribute page(callback) This is equivalent to page('*', callback) for generic ""middleware"". page(path) Navigate to the given path. $('.view').click(function(e){   page('/user/12')   e.preventDefault() }) page(fromPath, toPath) Setup redirect from one path to another. page.redirect(fromPath, toPath) Identical to page(fromPath, toPath) page.redirect(path) Calling page.redirect with only a string as the first parameter redirects to another route. Waits for the current route to push state and after replaces it with the new one leaving the browser history clean. page('/default', function(){   // some logic to decide which route to redirect to   if(admin) {     page.redirect('/admin');   } else {     page.redirect('/guest');   } });  page('/default'); page.show(path) Identical to page(path) above. page([options]) Register page's popstate / click bindings. If you're doing selective binding you'll like want to pass { click: false } to specify this yourself. The following options are available: click bind to click events [true] popstate bind to popstate [true] dispatch perform initial dispatch [true] hashbang add #! before urls [false] decodeURLComponents remove URL encoding from path components (query string, pathname, hash) [true] If you wish to load serve initial content from the server you likely will want to set dispatch to false. page.start([options]) Identical to page([options]) above. page.stop() Unbind both the popstate and click handlers. page.base([path]) Get or set the base path. For example if page.js is operating within /blog/* set the base path to ""/blog"". page.exit(path, callback[, callback ...]) Defines an exit route mapping path to the given callback(s). Exit routes are called when a page changes, using the context from the previous change. For example: page('/sidebar', function(ctx, next) {   sidebar.open = true   next() })  page.exit('/sidebar', function(ctx, next) {   sidebar.open = false   next() }) page.exit(callback) Equivalent to page.exit('*', callback). Context Routes are passed Context objects, these may be used to share state, for example ctx.user =, as well as the history ""state"" ctx.state that the pushState API provides. Context#save() Saves the context using replaceState(). For example this is useful for caching HTML or other resources that were loaded for when a user presses ""back"". Context#handled If true, marks the context as handled to prevent default 404 behaviour. For example this is useful for the routes with interminate quantity of the callbacks. Context#canonicalPath Pathname including the ""base"" (if any) and query string ""/admin/login?foo=bar"". Context#path Pathname and query string ""/login?foo=bar"". Context#querystring Query string void of leading ? such as ""foo=bar"", defaults to """". Context#pathname The pathname void of query string ""/login"". Context#state The pushState state object. Context#title The pushState title. Routing The router uses the same string-to-regexp conversion that Express does, so things like "":id"", "":id?"", and ""*"" work as you might expect. Another aspect that is much like Express is the ability to pass multiple callbacks. You can use this to your advantage to flatten nested callbacks, or simply to abstract components. Separating concerns For example suppose you have a route to edit users, and a route to view users. In both cases you need to load the user. One way to achieve this is with several callbacks as shown here: page('/user/:user', load, show) page('/user/:user/edit', load, edit) Using the * character we can alter this to match all routes prefixed with ""/user"" to achieve the same result: page('/user/*', load) page('/user/:user', show) page('/user/:user/edit', edit) Likewise * can be used as catch-alls after all routes acting as a 404 handler, before all routes, in-between and so on. For example: page('/user/:user', load, show) page('*', function(){   $('body').text('Not found!') }) Default 404 behaviour By default when a route is not matched, page.js invokes page.stop() to unbind itself, and proceed with redirecting to the location requested. This means you may use page.js with a multi-page application without explicitly binding to certain links. Working with parameters and contexts Much like request and response objects are passed around in Express, page.js has a single ""Context"" object. Using the previous examples of load and show for a user, we can assign arbitrary properties to ctx to maintain state between callbacks. To build a load function that will load the user for subsequent routes you'll need to access the "":id"" passed. You can do this with ctx.params.NAME much like Express: function load(ctx, next){   var id = ctx.params.id } Then perform some kind of action against the server, assigning the user to ctx.user for other routes to utilize. next() is then invoked to pass control to the following matching route in sequence, if any. function load(ctx, next){   var id = ctx.params.id   $.getJSON('/user/' + id + '.json', function(user){     ctx.user = user     next()   }) } The ""show"" function might look something like this, however you may render templates or do anything you want. Note that here next() is not invoked, because this is considered the ""end point"", and no routes will be matched until another link is clicked or page(path) is called. function show(ctx){   $('body')     .empty()     .append('<h1>' + ctx.user.name + '<h1>'); } Finally using them like so: page('/user/:id', load, show) Working with state When working with the pushState API, and page.js you may optionally provide state objects available when the user navigates the history. For example if you had a photo application and you performed a relatively expensive search to populate a list of images, normally when a user clicks ""back"" in the browser the route would be invoked and the query would be made yet-again. An example implemenation might look as follows: function show(ctx){   $.getJSON('/photos', function(images){     displayImages(images)   }) } You may utilize the history's state object to cache this result, or any other values you wish. This makes it possible to completely omit the query when a user presses back, providing a much nicer experience. function show(ctx){   if (ctx.state.images) {     displayImages(ctx.state.images)   } else {     $.getJSON('/photos', function(images){       ctx.state.images = images       ctx.save()       displayImages(images)     })   } } NOTE: ctx.save() must be used if the state changes after the first tick (xhr, setTimeout, etc), otherwise it is optional and the state will be saved after dispatching. Matching paths Here are some examples of what's possible with the string to RegExp conversion. Match an explicit path: page('/about', callback) Match with required parameter accessed via ctx.params.name: page('/user/:name', callback) Match with several params, for example /user/tj/edit or /user/tj/view. page('/user/:name/:operation', callback) Match with one optional and one required, now /user/tj will match the same route as /user/tj/show etc: page('/user/:name/:operation?', callback) Use the wildcard char * to match across segments, available via ctx.params[N] where N is the index of * since you may use several. For example the following will match /user/12/edit, /user/12/albums/2/admin and so on. page('/user/*', loadUser) Named wildcard accessed, for example /file/javascripts/jquery.js would provide ""/javascripts/jquery.js"" as ctx.params.file: page('/file/:file(*)', loadUser) And of course RegExp literals, where the capture groups are available via ctx.params[N] where N is the index of the capture group. page(/^\/commits\/(\d+)\.\.(\d+)/, loadUser) Plugins An example plugin examples/query-string/query.js demonstrates how to make plugins. It will provide a parsed ctx.query object derived from node-querystring. Usage by using ""*"" to match any path in order to parse the query-string: page('*', parse) page('/', show) page()  function parse(ctx, next) {   ctx.query = qs.parse(location.search.slice(1));   next(); }  function show(ctx) {   if (Object.keys(ctx.query).length) {     document       .querySelector('pre')       .textContent = JSON.stringify(ctx.query, null, 2);   } } Available plugins querystring: provides a parsed ctx.query object derived from node-querystring. body-parser: provides a req.body object for routes derived from body-parser. express-mapper: provides a direct imitation of the Express API so you can share controller code on the client and the server with your Express application without modification.

Running tests In the console: $ npm install $ npm test  In the browser: $ npm install $ npm run serve $ open http://localhost:3000/  Support in IE8+ If you want the router to work in older version of Internet Explorer that don't support pushState, you can use the HTML5-History-API polyfill:   npm install html5-history-api How to use a Polyfill together with router (OPTIONAL): If your web app is located within a nested basepath, you will need to specify the basepath for the HTML5-History-API polyfill. Before calling page.base() use: history.redirect([prefixType], [basepath]) - Translation link if required. prefixType: [string|null] - Substitute the string after the anchor (#) by default ""/"". basepath: [string|null] - Set the base path. See page.base() by default ""/"". (Note: Slash after pathname required) Pull Requests Break commits into a single objective. An objective should be a chunk of code that is related but requires explaination. Commits should be in the form of what-it-is: how-it-does-it and or why-it's-needed or what-it-is for trivial changes Pull requests and commits should be a guide to the code.

Features Lightweight Supports the HTML5 History API, the 'onhashchange' method, and graceful degredation Supports root routes, rescue methods, paramaterized routes, optional route components (dynamic routes), and Aspect Oriented Programming Well Tested (tests available in the ./tests directory) Compatible with all major browsers (Tested on Firefox 3.6, Firefox 4.0, Firefox 5.0, Chrome 9, Opera 11, IE7, IE8, IE9) Independant of all third party libraries, but plays nice with all of them Using PathJS - A Brief Example function clearPanel(){     // You can put some code in here to do fancy DOM transitions, such as fade-out or slide-in. }  Path.map(""#/users"").to(function(){     alert(""Users!""); });  Path.map(""#/comments"").to(function(){     alert(""Comments!""); }).enter(clearPanel);  Path.map(""#/posts"").to(function(){     alert(""Posts!""); }).enter(clearPanel);  Path.root(""#/posts"");  Path.listen();  Documentation and Tips Any of the examples above confuse you? Read up on the details in the wiki. Examples You can find examples on the official Github Page. Running Tests To run the tests, simply navigate to the ./tests folder and open the HTML file in your browser. Please note that the HTML5 History API is not compatible with the file:// protocol, and to run the tests in the tests/pushstate folder, you will need to run them through a webserver such as nginx or Apache. Next Steps Adding support for ""after"" callbacks Deprecating the ""enter"" callback in favour of ""before"" Pull Requests To make a pull request, please do the following: Mention what specific version of PathJS you were using when you encountered the issue/added the feature. This can be accessed by doing Path.version in a debugger console Provide a pastie or gist that demonstrates the bug/feature Make sure you update the test suite with your changes. All tests must pass Make sure to update the minified version of the source Do not modify the Path.version attribute. I will modify that manually when merging the request Disclaimer This code is provided with no warranty. While I strive to maintain backwards compatibility, the code is still under active development. As this is the case, some revisions may break break compatibility with earlier versions of the library. Please keep this in mind when using PathJS.

It parses a string input and decides which action should be executed by matching the string against multiple patterns. If used properly it can reduce code complexity by decoupling objects and also by abstracting navigation paths. See project page for documentation and more details.

If for some reason you need to build a custom version install Node.js and run: node build  This will delete all JS files inside the dist folder, merge/update/compress source files and copy the output to the dist folder. IMPORTANT: dist folder always contain the latest version, regular users should not need to run build task. Running unit tests On the browser Open dev/tests/spec_runner-dist.html on your browser. spec_runner-dist tests dist/crossroads.js and spec_runner-dev tests files inside dev/src - they all run the same specs. On Node.js Install npm and run: npm install --dev npm test  Each time you run npm test the files inside the dist folder will be updated (it executes node build as a pretest script).

Why Using the history pustState and popstate events allows the links and forms in your app to have hrefs and actions that point to real end points on your server. This allows complex JavaScript apps to degrade gracefully when JavaScript is unavailable and combining this with a template system that can be used both client and server side allows for large amounts of code reuse. Davis.js is heavily inspired by Sammy.js (hence the name), it is however intentionally much lighter than Sammy.js because I never use any of the template rendering etc that it includes. All Davis.js does is provide a simple routing layer, nothing more, nothing less. Requirements Davis.js requires jQuery 1.4.2+ as well as a modern browser that supports HTML5 history.pushState and the onpopstate event. At the moment that means FireFox 4+, Safari 5+, Chrome, iOS Safari 4+*, Android Browser 2.2+, Opera 11.50+. In all other browsers Davis.js is currently unsupported, all links and forms will have their default behaviour. You can bind to the 'unsupported' event on an app to handle this situation in your code. Fallback to location.hash and onhashchange is a possibility in the future. *Whilst pushState is supported in iOS it has several, fairly serious bugs. Davis will not fire the unsupported event though as technically iOS does support davis. Installation Download davis.min.js and include it on your page after jquery. Example A very simple example of a Davis.js app: var app = Davis(function () {   this.get('/welcome/:name', function (req) {     $('body').append('<h1>Hello there, ' + req.params['name'] + '!</h1>')   }) })  $(document).ready(function () {   // append a link to trigger the route   $('body').append('<a href=""/welcome/bob"">Greet</a>');    app.start(); })  We create a new instance of a Davis.App using the Davis.js function, passing in a function that will draw the routes for the application. Inside this function this is the instance of our application. We define a simple get route with a 'name' parameter and a callback that will append a message to the html body. Inside the route callback this is set to the request that matches the route, this request is also passed as a parameter to the callback. Once the app is configure it needs to be started. You start a Davis.js app by calling the start method, this must be done once the document is ready. Now if you click on the link that we appended to the body our route should be called and a friendly greeting printed on the page. To use Davis your html file must be loaded from a server rather than just opening the file in your browser.

It's also very simple to use and get started with. DOMPurify is written in JavaScript and works in all modern browsers (Safari, Opera (15+), Internet Explorer (10+), Edge, Firefox and Chrome - as well as almost anything else using Blink or WebKit). It doesn't break on IE6 or other legacy browsers. It simply does nothing there. Our automated tests cover 12 different browsers right now. We also cover Node.js v4.0.0, v5.0.0 and v6.0.0, running DOMPurify on jsdom. DOMPurify is written by security people who have vast background in web attacks and XSS. Fear not. For more details please also read about our Security Goals & Threat Model What does it do? DOMPurify sanitizes HTML and prevents XSS attacks. You can feed DOMPurify with string full of dirty HTML and it will return a string with clean HTML. DOMPurify will strip out everything that contains dangerous HTML and thereby prevent XSS attacks and other nastiness. It's also damn bloody fast. We use the technologies the browser provides and turn them into an XSS filter. The faster your browser, the faster DOMPurify will be. How do I use it? It's easy. Just include DOMPurify on your website. Using the unminified development version <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""src/purify.js""></script> Using the minified and tested production version (source-map available) <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""dist/purify.min.js""></script> Afterwards you can sanitize strings by executing the following code: var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty); The resulting HTML can be written into a DOM element using innerHTML or the DOM using document.write(). That is fully up to you. But keep in mind, if you use the sanitized HTML with jQuery's very insecure elm.html() method, then the SAFE_FOR_JQUERY flag has to be set to make sure it's safe! Other than that, all is fine. After sanitizing your markup, you can also have a look at the property DOMPurify.removed and find out, what elements and attributes were thrown out. If you're using an AMD module loader like Require.js, you can load this script asynchronously as well: require(['dompurify'], function(DOMPurify) {     var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty); }); DOMPurify also works server-side with node.js as well as client-side via Browserify or similar translators. Node.js 0.x is not supported; either io.js or Node.js 4.x or newer is required. npm install dompurify const createDOMPurify = require('dompurify'); const jsdom = require('jsdom'); const window = jsdom.jsdom('', {   features: {     FetchExternalResources: false, // disables resource loading over HTTP / filesystem     ProcessExternalResources: false // do not execute JS within script blocks   } }).defaultView; const DOMPurify = createDOMPurify(window);  const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty)); Strictly speaking, DOMPurify creates a document without a browsing context and you can replace it with const window = jsdom.jsdom().defaultView;, however, the longer case protects against accidental bugs in jsdom or DOMPurify. Is there a demo? Of course there is a demo! Play with DOMPurify What if I find a bypass? If that happens, you probably qualify for a juicy bug bounty! The fine folks over at FastMail use DOMPurify for their services and added our library to their bug bounty scope. So, if you find a way to bypass or weaken DOMPurify, please have a look at their website and the bug bounty info. Some purification samples please? How does purified markup look like? Well, the demo shows it for a big bunch of nasty elements. But let's also show some smaller examples! DOMPurify.sanitize('<img src=x onerror=alert(1)//>'); // becomes <img src=""x""> DOMPurify.sanitize('<svg><g/onload=alert(2)//<p>'); // becomes <svg><g></g></svg> DOMPurify.sanitize('<p>abc<iframe/\/src=jAva&Tab;script:alert(3)>def'); // becomes <p>abc</p> DOMPurify.sanitize('<math><mi//xlink:href=""data:x,<script>alert(4)</script>"">'); // becomes <math></math> DOMPurify.sanitize('<TABLE><tr><td>HELLO</tr></TABL>'); // becomes <table><tbody><tr><td>HELLO</td></tr></tbody></table> DOMPurify.sanitize('<UL><li><A HREF=//google.com>click</UL>'); // becomes <ul><li><a href=""//google.com"">click</a></li></ul> What is supported? DOMPurify currently supports HTML5, SVG and MathML. DOMPurify per default allows CSS, HTML custom data attributes. DOMPurify also supports the Shadow DOM - and sanitizes DOM templates recursively. DOMPurify also allows you to sanitize HTML for being used with the jQuery $() and elm.html() methods but requires the SAFE_FOR_JQUERY flag for that - see below. Can I configure it? Yes. The included default configuration values are pretty good already - but you can of course override them. Check out the /demos folder to see a bunch of examples on how you can customize DOMPurify. // make output safe for usage in jQuery's $()/html() method (default is false) var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {SAFE_FOR_JQUERY: true});  // strip {{ ... }} and <% ... %> to make output safe for template systems var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {SAFE_FOR_TEMPLATES: true});  // allow only <b> var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b']});  // allow only <b> and <q> with style attributes (for whatever reason) var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'q'], ALLOWED_ATTR: ['style']});  // leave all as it is but forbid <style> var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {FORBID_TAGS: ['style']});  // leave all as it is but forbid style attributes var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {FORBID_ATTR: ['style']});  // extend the existing array of allowed tags var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ADD_TAGS: ['my-tag']});  // extend the existing array of attributes var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ADD_ATTR: ['my-attr']});  // prohibit HTML5 data attributes (default is true) var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOW_DATA_ATTR: false});  // allow external protocol handlers in URL attributes (default is false) // by default only http, https, ftp, ftps, tel and mailto are allowed. var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOW_UNKNOWN_PROTOCOLS: true});  // return a DOM HTMLBodyElement instead of an HTML string (default is false) var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {RETURN_DOM: true});  // return a DOM DocumentFragment instead of an HTML string (default is false) var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {RETURN_DOM_FRAGMENT: true});  // return a DOM DocumentFragment instead of an HTML string (default is false) // also import it into the current document (default is false). // RETURN_DOM_IMPORT must be set if you would like to append // the returned node to the current document var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {RETURN_DOM_FRAGMENT: true, RETURN_DOM_IMPORT: true}); document.body.appendChild(clean);  // return entire document including <html> tags (default is false) var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {WHOLE_DOCUMENT: true});  // disable DOM Clobbering protection on output (default is true, handle with care!) var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {SANITIZE_DOM: false});  // discard an element's content when the element is removed (default is true) var clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {KEEP_CONTENT: false}); There is even more examples here, showing how you can run, customize and configure DOMPurify to fit your needs. Hooks DOMPurify allows you to augment its functionality by attaching one or more functions with the DOMPurify.addHook method to one of the following hooks: beforeSanitizeElements uponSanitizeElement afterSanitizeElements beforeSanitizeAttributes uponSanitizeAttribute afterSanitizeAttributes beforeSanitizeShadowDOM uponSanitizeShadowNode afterSanitizeShadowDOM It passes the currently processed DOM node, when needed a literal with verified node and attribute data and the DOMPurify configuration to the callback. Check out the MentalJS hook demo to see how the API can be used nicely. Example: DOMPurify.addHook('beforeSanitizeElements', function(currentNode, data, config) {     // Do something with the current node and return it     return currentNode; }); Continuous Integration We are currently using Travis CI in combination with BrowserStack. This gives us the possibility to confirm for each and every commit that all is going according to plan in all supported browsers. Check out the build logs here: https://travis-ci.org/cure53/DOMPurify You can further run local tests by executing npm test. The tests work fine with Node.js v0.6.2 and jsdom@8.5.0. All relevant commits will be signed with the key 0x24BB6BF4 for additional security (since 8th of April 2016). Security Mailing List We maintain a mailing list that notifies whenever a security-critical release of DOMPurify was published. This means, if someone found a bypass and we fixed it with a release (which always happens when a bypass was found) a mail will go out to that list. This usually happens within minutes or few hours after learning about a bypass.

(What is XSS attack?) Project Homepage: http://jsxss.com Try Online: http://jsxss.com/en/try.html 中文版文档 Features Specifies HTML tags and their attributes allowed with whitelist Handle any tags or attributes using custom function. Reference XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet Data URI scheme XSS with Data URI Scheme Benchmark (for references only) the xss module: 8.2 MB/s xss() function from module validator@0.3.7: 4.4 MB/s For test code please refer to benchmark directory. Unit Test Run npm test command in the source directary. Install NPM $ npm install xss Bower $ bower install xss Or $ bower install https://github.com/leizongmin/js-xss.git Usages On Node.js var xss = require('xss'); var html = xss('<script>alert(""xss"");</script>'); console.log(html); On Browser Shim mode (reference file test/test.html): <script src=""https://raw.github.com/leizongmin/js-xss/master/dist/xss.js""></script> <script> // apply function filterXSS in the same way var html = filterXSS('<script>alert(""xss"");</scr' + 'ipt>'); alert(html); </script> AMD mode - shim: <script> require.config({   baseUrl: './',   paths: {     xss: 'https://raw.github.com/leizongmin/js-xss/master/dist/xss.js'   },   shim: {     xss: {exports: 'filterXSS'}   } }) require(['xss'], function (xss) {   var html = xss('<script>alert(""xss"");</scr' + 'ipt>');   alert(html); }); </script> Command Line Tool Process File You can use the xss command line tool to process a file. Usage: xss -i <input_file> -o <output_file> Example: $ xss -i origin.html -o target.html Active Test Run the following command, them you can type HTML code in the command-line, and check the filtered output: $ xss -t For more details, please run $ xss -h to see it. Custom filter rules When using the xss() function, the second parameter could be used to specify custom rules: options = {};  // Custom rules html = xss('<script>alert(""xss"");</script>', options); To avoid passing options every time, you can also do it in a faster way by creating a FilterXSS instance: options = {};  // Custom rules myxss = new xss.FilterXSS(options); // then apply myxss.process() html = myxss.process('<script>alert(""xss"");</script>'); Details of parameters in options would be described below. Whitelist By specifying a whiteList, e.g. { 'tagName': [ 'attr-1', 'attr-2' ] }. Tags and attributes not in the whitelist would be filter out. For example: // only tag a and its attributes href, title, target are allowed var options = {   whiteList: {     a: ['href', 'title', 'target']   } }; // With the configuration specified above, the following HTML: // <a href=""#"" onclick=""hello()""><i>Hello</i></a> // would become: // <a href=""#"">Hello</a> For the default whitelist, please refer xss.whiteList. Customize the handler function for matched tags By specifying the handler function with onTag: function onTag (tag, html, options) {   // tag is the name of current tag, e.g. 'a' for tag <a>   // html is the HTML of this tag, e.g. '<a>' for tag <a>   // options is some addition informations:   //   isWhite    boolean, whether the tag is in whitelist   //   isClosing  boolean, whether the tag is a closing tag, e.g. true for </a>   //   position        integer, the position of the tag in output result   //   sourcePosition  integer, the position of the tag in input HTML source   // If a string is returned, the current tag would be replaced with the string   // If return nothing, the default measure would be taken:   //   If in whitelist: filter attributes using onTagAttr, as described below   //   If not in whitelist: handle by onIgnoreTag, as described below } Customize the handler function for attributes of matched tags By specifying the handler function with onTagAttr: function onTagAttr (tag, name, value, isWhiteAttr) {   // tag is the name of current tag, e.g. 'a' for tag <a>   // name is the name of current attribute, e.g. 'href' for href=""#""   // isWhiteAttr whether the tag is in whitelist   // If a string is returned, the attribute would be replaced with the string   // If return nothing, the default measure would be taken:   //   If in whitelist: filter the value using safeAttrValue as described below   //   If not in whitelist: handle by onIgnoreTagAttr, as described below } Customize the handler function for tags not in the whitelist By specifying the handler function with onIgnoreTag: function onIgnoreTag (tag, html, options) {   // Parameters are the same with onTag   // If a string is returned, the tag would be replaced with the string   // If return nothing, the default measure would be taken (specifies using   // escape, as described below) } Customize the handler function for attributes not in the whitelist By specifying the handler function with onIgnoreTagAttr: function onIgnoreTagAttr (tag, name, value, isWhiteAttr) {   // Parameters are the same with onTagAttr   // If a string is returned, the value would be replaced with this string   // If return nothing, then keep default (remove the attribute) } Customize escaping function for HTML By specifying the handler function with escapeHtml. Following is the default function (Modification is not recommended): function escapeHtml (html) {   return html.replace(/</g, '&lt;').replace(/>/g, '&gt;'); } Customize escaping function for value of attributes By specifying the handler function with safeAttrValue: function safeAttrValue (tag, name, value) {   // Parameters are the same with onTagAttr (without options)   // Return the value as a string } Quick Start Filter out tags not in the whitelist By using stripIgnoreTag parameter: true filter out tags not in the whitelist false: by default: escape the tag using configured escape function Example: If stripIgnoreTag = true is set, the following code: code:<script>alert(/xss/);</script> would output filtered: code:alert(/xss/); Filter out tags and tag bodies not in the whitelist By using stripIgnoreTagBody parameter: false|null|undefined by default: do nothing '*'|true: filter out all tags not in the whitelist ['tag1', 'tag2']: filter out only specified tags not in the whitelist Example: If stripIgnoreTagBody = ['script'] is set, the following code: code:<script>alert(/xss/);</script> would output filtered: code: Filter out HTML comments By using allowCommentTag parameter: true: do nothing false by default: filter out HTML comments Example: If allowCommentTag = false is set, the following code: code:<!-- something --> END would output filtered: code: END Examples Allow attributes of whitelist tags start with data- var source = '<div a=""1"" b=""2"" data-a=""3"" data-b=""4"">hello</div>'; var html = xss(source, {   onIgnoreTagAttr: function (tag, name, value, isWhiteAttr) {     if (name.substr(0, 5) === 'data-') {       // escape its value using built-in escapeAttrValue function       return name + '=""' + xss.escapeAttrValue(value) + '""';     }   } });  console.log('%s\nconvert to:\n%s', source, html); Result: <div a=""1"" b=""2"" data-a=""3"" data-b=""4"">hello</div> convert to: <div data-a=""3"" data-b=""4"">hello</div> Allow tags start with x- var source = '<x><x-1>he<x-2 checked></x-2>wwww</x-1><a>'; var html = xss(source, {   onIgnoreTag: function (tag, html, options) {     if (tag.substr(0, 2) === 'x-') {       // do not filter its attributes       return html;     }   } });  console.log('%s\nconvert to:\n%s', source, html); Result: <x><x-1>he<x-2 checked></x-2>wwww</x-1><a> convert to: &lt;x&gt;<x-1>he<x-2 checked></x-2>wwww</x-1><a> Parse images in HTML var source = '<img src=""img1"">a<img src=""img2"">b<img src=""img3"">c<img src=""img4"">d'; var list = []; var html = xss(source, {   onTagAttr: function (tag, name, value, isWhiteAttr) {     if (tag === 'img' && name === 'src') {       // Use the built-in friendlyAttrValue function to escape attribute       // values. It supports converting entity tags such as &lt; to printable       // characters such as <       list.push(xss.friendlyAttrValue(value));     }     // Return nothing, means keep the default handling measure   } });  console.log('image list:\n%s', list.join(', ')); Result: image list: img1, img2, img3, img4 Filter out HTML tags (keeps only plain text) var source = '<strong>hello</strong><script>alert(/xss/);</script>end'; var html = xss(source, {   whiteList:          [],        // empty, means filter out all tags   stripIgnoreTag:     true,      // filter out all HTML not in the whilelist   stripIgnoreTagBody: ['script'] // the script tag is a special case, we need                                  // to filter out its content });  console.log('text: %s', html); Result: text: helloend License Copyright (c) 2012-2016 Zongmin Lei(雷宗民) <leizongmin@gmail.com> http://ucdok.com  The MIT License  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the ""Software""), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Include it once and see it the same every time you open up the page, in every browser, on mobile etc. It also adds some unique functions as the “watching” list. It let you watch variables as many browsers debug console does. But setting up the watches via javascript is much easier, can be conditional and you don't have to do it every time you launch the browser.

Just pass any data to log() and you'll see it printed clearly and well-structured in the console. If the browser doesn't have a console, Firebug Lite will load. You can pass any variable type: strings, objects, arrays, functions, etc. Demo: patik.github.io/console.log-wrapper Installation npm: npm install consolelog Bower: bower install consolelog Or just download consolelog.js and reference it in your page with a <script> tag. Usage Use log() wherever you want to write to the console. AMD with RequireJS Consolelog.js is AMD-compliant and supports Common JS: require(['consolelog'], function(log) {     log('It works!'); }); Settings You can change some optional preferences by passing an object to log.settings(). The defaults are shown below. log.settings({     lineNumber: true,     group: {         label: 'Log:',         collapsed: false     } }); lineNumber (Boolean) Whether to append the actual line number to each log. Not supported by all browsers. group (Boolean or object) Groups the arguments for each log together collapsed: true will collapse each group (in browsers that support collapsing) label: ""some string"" sets the label or name for the groups Simply setting group: true is a shorthand way of selecting the defaults Detail Print This is an optional plugin to provide help information about the data that is being logged, especially in IE and older browsers. Just include consolelog.detailprint.js along with consolelog.js. Firebug, WebKit's Developer Tools, and Opera's Dragonfly print useful, interactive items to the console. For example: console.log(     ""Here's a string"",      3.14,      {""alpha"": 5, ""bravo"": false},      document.getElementById('charlie'),      new Date() ); Results in: Some browsers that have a primitive console — one that does not expand arrays, does not link DOM elements to the source code, only prints objects as [object Object] rather than listing their properties, etc. Some cannot accept multiple arguments to a single console.log call. This includes IE 7/8/9/10, iOS 5 and older, and Opera 11 and older, among others. Using the detailPrint companion plugin, special objects are presented in a more readable manner.

This is a barebones reliable everyday logging library. It does not do fancy things, it does not let you reconfigure appenders or add complex log filtering rules or boil tea (more's the pity), but it does have the all core functionality that you actually use: Features Simple Log things at a given level (trace/debug/info/warn/error) to the console object (as seen in all modern browsers & node.js) Filter logging by level (all the above or 'silent'), so you can disable all but error logging in production, and then run log.setLevel(""trace"") in your console to turn it all back on for a furious debugging session Single file, no dependencies, weighs in at 1.1KB minified and gzipped Effective Log methods gracefully fall back to simpler console logging methods if more specific ones aren't available: so calls to log.debug() go to console.debug() if possible, or console.log() if not Logging calls still succeed even if there's no console object at all, so your site doesn't break when people visit with old browsers that don't support the console object (here's looking at you IE) and similar This then comes together giving a consistent reliable API that works in every JavaScript environment with a console available, and never breaks anything anywhere else Convenient Log output keeps line numbers: most JS logging frameworks call console.log methods through wrapper functions, clobbering your stacktrace and making the extra info many browsers provide useless. We'll have none of that thanks. It works with all the standard JavaScript loading systems out of the box (CommonJS, AMD, or just as a global) Logging is filtered to ""warn"" level by default, to keep your live site clean in normal usage (or you can trivially re-enable everything with an initial log.enableAll() call) Magically handles situations where console logging is not initially available (IE8/9), and automatically enables logging as soon as it does become available (when developer console is opened) Extensible, to add other log redirection, filtering, or formatting functionality, while keeping all the above (except you will clobber your stacktrace, see Plugins below) Downloading loglevel If you're using NPM, you can just run npm install loglevel. Alternatively, loglevel is also available via Bower (bower install loglevel), JamJS (jam install loglevel), as a Webjar, or an Atmosphere package (for Meteor) Alternatively if you just want to grab the file yourself, you can download either the current stable production version or the development version directly, or reference it remotely on CDNJS at //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/loglevel/1.4.0/loglevel.min.js Finally, if you want to tweak loglevel to your own needs or you immediately need the cutting-edge version, clone this repo and see Developing & Contributing below for build instructions. Setting it up loglevel supports AMD (e.g. RequireJS), CommonJS (e.g. Node.js) and direct usage (e.g. loading globally with a <script> tag) loading methods. You should be able to do nearly anything, and then skip to the next section anyway and have it work. Just in case though, here's some specific examples that definitely do the right thing: CommonsJS (e.g. Node) var log = require('loglevel'); log.info(""unreasonably simple""); AMD (e.g. RequireJS) define(['loglevel'], function(log) {    log.warn(""dangerously convenient""); }); Directly in your web page: <script src=""loglevel.min.js""></script> <script> log.error(""too easy""); </script> With noConflict(): If you're using another JavaScript library that exposes a 'log' global, you can run into conflicts with loglevel. Similarly to jQuery, you can solve this by putting loglevel into no-conflict mode immediately after it is loaded onto the page. This resets to 'log' global to its value before loglevel was loaded (typically undefined), and returns the loglevel object, which you can then bind to another name yourself. For example: <script src=""loglevel.min.js""></script> <script> var logging = log.noConflict();  logging.error(""still pretty easy""); </script> Documentation The loglevel API is extremely minimal. All methods are available on the root loglevel object, which it's suggested you name 'log' (this is the default if you import it in globally, and is what's set up in the above examples). The API consists of: 5 actual logging methods, ordered and available as: log.trace(msg) log.debug(msg) log.info(msg) log.warn(msg) log.error(msg) Exact output formatting of these will depend on the console available in the current context of your application. For example, many environments will include a full stack trace with all trace() calls, and icons or similar to highlight other calls. These methods should never fail in any environment, even if no console object is currently available, and should always fall back to an available log method even if the specific method called (e.g. warn) isn't available. Be aware that all this means that these method won't necessarily always produce exactly the output you expect in every environment; loglevel only guarantees that these methods will never explode on you, and that it will call the most relevant method it can find, with your argument. Firefox is a notable example here: due to a current Firefox bug log.trace(msg) calls in Firefox will print only the stacktrace, and won't include any passed message arguments. A log.setLevel(level, [persist]) method. This disables all logging below the given level, so that after a log.setLevel(""warn"") call log.warn(""something"") or log.error(""something"") will output messages, but log.info(""something"") will not. This can take either a log level name or 'silent' (which disables everything) in one of a few forms: As a log level from the internal levels list, e.g. log.levels.SILENT ← for type safety As a string, like 'error' (case-insensitive) ← for a reasonable practical balance As a numeric index from 0 (trace) to 5 (silent) ← deliciously terse, and more easily programmable (...although, why?) Where possible the log level will be persisted. LocalStorage will be used if available, falling back to cookies if not. If neither is available in the current environment (i.e. in Node), or if you pass false as the optional 'persist' second argument, persistence will be skipped. If log.setLevel() is called when a console object is not available (in IE 8 or 9 before the developer tools have been opened, for example) logging will remain silent until the console becomes available, and then begin logging at the requested level. A log.setDefaultLevel(level) method. This sets the current log level only if one has not been persisted and can’t be loaded. This is useful when initializing scripts; if a developer or user has previously called setLevel(), this won’t alter their settings. For example, your application might set the log level to error in a production environment, but when debugging an issue, you might call setLevel(""trace"") on the console to see all the logs. If that error setting was set using setDefaultLevel(), it will still say as trace on subsequent page loads and refreshes instead of resetting to error. The level argument takes is the same values that you might pass to setLevel(). Levels set using setDefaultLevel() never persist to subsequent page loads. log.enableAll() and log.disableAll() methods. These enable or disable all log messages, and are equivalent to log.setLevel(""trace"") and log.setLevel(""silent"") respectively. A log.getLevel() method. Returns the current logging level, as a number from 0 (trace) to 5 (silent) It's very unlikely you'll need to use this for normal application logging; it's provided partly to help plugin development, and partly to let you optimize logging code as below, where debug data is only generated if the level is set such that it'll actually be logged. This probably doesn't affect you, unless you've run profiling on your code and you have hard numbers telling you that your log data generation is a real performance problem. if (log.getLevel() <= log.levels.DEBUG) {   var logData = runExpensiveDataGeneration();   log.debug(logData); } This notably isn't the right solution to avoid the cost of string concatenation in your logging. Firstly, it's very unlikely that string concatenation in your logging is really an important performance problem. Even if you do genuinely have hard metrics showing that it is though, the better solution that wrapping your log statements in this is to use multiple arguments, as below. The underlying console API will automatically concatenate these for you if logging is enabled, and if it isn't then all log methods are no-ops, and no concatenation will be done at all. // Prints 'My concatenated log message' log.debug(""My "", ""concatenated "", ""log message""); A log.getLogger(loggerName) method. This gets you a new logger object that works exactly like the root log object, but can have its level and logging methods set independently. All loggers must have a name (which is a non-empty string). Calling getLogger() multiple times with the same name will return an identical logger object. In large applications, it can be incredibly useful to turn logging on and off for particular modules as you are working with them. Using the getLogger() method lets you create a separate logger for each part of your application with its own logging level. Likewise, for small, independent modules, using a named logger instead of the default root logger allows developers using your module to selectively turn on deep, trace-level logging when trying to debug problems, while logging only errors or silencing logging altogether under normal circumstances. Example usage (using CommonJS modules, but you could do the same with any module system): // In module-one.js: var log = require(""loglevel"").getLogger(""module-one""); function doSomethingAmazing() {   log.debug(""Amazing message from module one.""); }  // In module-two.js: var log = require(""loglevel"").getLogger(""module-two""); function doSomethingSpecial() {   log.debug(""Special message from module two.""); }  // In your main application module: var log = require(""loglevel""); var moduleOne = require(""module-one""); var moduleTwo = require(""module-two""); log.getLogger(""module-two"").setLevel(""TRACE"");  moduleOne.doSomethingAmazing(); moduleTwo.doSomethingSpecial(); // logs ""Special message from module two."" // (but nothing from module one.) Loggers returned by getLogger() support all the same properties and methods as the default root logger, excepting noConflict() and the getLogger() method itself. Like the root logger, other loggers can have their logging level saved. If a logger’s level has not been saved, it will inherit the root logger’s level when it is first created. If the root logger’s level changes later, the new level will not affect other loggers that have already been created. Likewise, loggers will inherit the root logger’s methodFactory. After creation, each logger can have its methodFactory independently set. See the plugins section below for more about methodFactory. Plugins Existing plugins: ServerSend - https://github.com/artemyarulin/loglevel-serverSend - Forward your log messages to a remote server. Standard Streams - https://github.com/NatLibFi/loglevel-std-streams - Route logging through STDERR in Node for easier log management. Message Prefix - https://github.com/NatLibFi/loglevel-message-prefix - Dynamic (timestamp/level) and static ('foo') message prefixing. DEBUG - https://github.com/vectrlabs/loglevel-debug - Control logging from a DEBUG environmental variable (similar to the classic Debug module) Writing plugins: Loglevel provides a simple reliable minimal base for console logging that works everywhere. This means it doesn't include lots of fancy functionality that might be useful in some cases, such as log formatting and redirection (e.g. also sending log messages to a server over AJAX) Including that would increase the size and complexity of the library, but more importantly would remove stacktrace information. Currently log methods are either disabled, or enabled with directly bound versions of the console.log methods (where possible). This means your browser shows the log message as coming from your code at the call to log.info(""message!"") not from within loglevel, since it really calls the bound console method directly, without indirection. The indirection required to dynamically format, further filter, or redirect log messages would stop this. There's clearly enough enthusiasm for this even at that cost though that loglevel now includes a plugin API. To use it, redefine log.methodFactory(methodName, logLevel, loggerName) with a function of your own. This will be called for each enabled method each time the level is set (including initially), and should return a function to be used for the given log method, at the given level, for a logger with the given name. If you'd like to retain all the reliability and features of loglevel, it's recommended that this wraps the initially provided value of log.methodFactory For example, a plugin to prefix all log messages with ""Newsflash: "" would look like: var originalFactory = log.methodFactory; log.methodFactory = function (methodName, logLevel, loggerName) {     var rawMethod = originalFactory(methodName, logLevel, loggerName);      return function (message) {         rawMethod(""Newsflash: "" + message);     }; }; log.setLevel(log.getLevel()); // Be sure to call setLevel method in order to apply plugin (The above supports only a single log.warn("""") argument for clarity, but it's easy to extend to a fuller varadic version) If you develop and release a plugin, please get in contact! I'd be happy to reference it here for future users. Some consistency is helpful; naming your plugin 'loglevel-PLUGINNAME' (e.g. loglevel-newsflash) is preferred, as is giving it the 'loglevel-plugin' keyword in your package.json Developing & Contributing In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Builds can be run with grunt: run grunt dist to build a distributable version of the project (in /dist), or grunt test to just run the tests and linting. During development you can run grunt watch and it will monitor source files, and rerun the tests and linting as appropriate when they're changed. Also, please don't manually edit files in the ""dist"" subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the ""lib"" subdirectory!

Log output can be filtered by namespace and log level. Pipe to one or more backend streams at the same time Backends: Node: Console, File (and all other WritableStreams), Redis Browser: Console, LocalStorage, jQuery.ajax In Chrome, we support theming the dev console output. See the docs at http://mixu.net/minilog/. Upgrading from 2.x to 3.x v3.0 changes the ajax logger's POST payload from newline-separated JSON lines to a hash { logs: [ ... ] }. Previously, this format was only used if logger.extras was set. This makes the POST payload parseable as JSON directly, but may require you to update your logging endpoint if you were using v2.x before. Pipes everywhere minilog is more convention than code. The logger is a EventEmitter, and backends are Writable streams. Filters and formatters are duplex (readable + writable) streams. minilog works in Node, and in the browser: // logs are scoped to a namespace for easy filtering (here, the namespace is ""app"") var log = require('minilog')('app'); require('minilog').enable();  in the browser (via a single exported global window.Minilog): <script src=""dist/minilog.js""></script> <script> var log = Minilog('app'); Minilog.enable(); </script>  Usage: // assuming you've done the two things above log   .debug('debug message')   .info('info message')   .log('info message')   .warn('warning')   .error('this is an error message');  Output: To log to the console: require('minilog').enable(); // or .pipe(process.stdout), if you don't want the default formatting and filtering  To log into a file: require('minilog').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./temp.log'));  You can also log to Redis and over HTTP to a RESTful API, see the backends at the end of this page. You can pipe to more than one endpoint if you want. Installation For Node: $ npm install minilog You can find a ready-made file for the web in ./dist/minilog.js. Upgrading from minilog v1 Everything is now a pipe, which means that the .format() and .filter() functions are deprecated. Check out the new filter mechanism docs. To apply a formatter, you should pipe the input into the formatter, and then pipe it to the desired backend: var Minilog = require('minilog');  Minilog.pipe(Minilog.backends.console.formatWithStack)        .pipe(Minilog.backends.console);  Enabling logging Minilog output is suppressed by default. To enable logging, append minilog=1 to the page URL: http://www.example.com/index.html?minilog=1  or call Minilog.enable() from the dev console or in code. On the browser, this also sets a value in LocalStorage so that logging is enabled on subsequent reloads. Call Minilog.disable() (new in v2) to stop logging. Filtering Minilog supports filtering via the log scope name and the log level, as well as a number of nifty features. See the filtering docs for more. Formatting & themes Minilog supports themes and custom formatters, and comes several with built-in themes: To enable a specific theme, pipe to the formatter and then to the console: var Minilog = require('minilog');  Minilog     // formatter     .pipe(Minilog.backends.console.formatClean)     // backend     .pipe(Minilog.backends.console);  Have a look at ./test/examples/themes_example.js. To write your own formatter, have a look at the source code for the formatters - they inherit from Minilog.Transform. Using Minilog as a console replacement If you use an injected console object to log browser or Node.js activity, you can use Minilog instead: they have similar interfaces. Monolog provides a log() method, which proxies to debug(). So for instance, the following snippet: function doThings(console) {     if (problem) {         console.error('problem');         return;     }     console.log('no problem'); } Works seamlessly with Minilog instead of console: var Minilog = require('minilog'); doThings(Minilog); Backends Backends are Writable streams which handle stringification. Node: Console, Redis The console backend is literally this (plus code for pretty printing log lines in various ways): {   write: function(str) { process.stdout.write(str); } }  The Redis backend is almost equally simple - it accepts client (an instance of node-redis) and key and uses rpush() to add to the list at the specified key. Browser: Array, Console, jQuery, localStorage The Array backend stores the log lines into an array. This is useful if you want to keep a list of all the log lines, e.g. for error reporting. Call .get() to get the array, and .clear() to empty it. The Console backend makes sure that console.log is available. On IE8 and IE9, it tries to make the console a bit less aweful by using JSON.stringify to convert objects into strings (rather than ""[Object object]""). The jQuery backend is useful for logging client-side log lines on the server side: it sends new log messages as a POST request to a given URL every 30 seconds if localStorage is available, logs are written to localStorage as well. This is helpful because it reduces the risk that you lose log lines just because the client navigates to a different page. Unsent logs from localStorage are sent the next time the backend is activated (on your domain, localStorage is isolated). No errors, even if localStorage is not available or jQuery is not defined (though no POST requests if no jQuery). The localStorage backend just writes logs to the given key in localstorage. Have a look at the example server setup in ./test/examples/jquery_server.js. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

The latest docs for v1.x can be recovered here. See also the CHANGELOG for details on new features and breaking changes. A library, plus a Chrome DevTools extension. Demo: http://storyboard-demo.herokuapp.com/ Why? Hierarchical stories: put logs in context (stories), and group stories/logs within stories. Stories are extremely useful with concurrent user actions and async events. Get the whole picture with end-to-end stories: see all client and server tasks triggered by a user action (a click on the Login button, maybe) in a single place. Use the Storyboard DevTools Chrome extension to view client and server logs with a clean and detail-rich interface. Now with remote client log monitoring for mobile devices and non-Chrome browsers. Not ready to change your application to use this library? No worries, use the CLI tool to call it, giving you remote access to your logs and compatibility with the Storyboard DevTools. Watch server logs being pushed in real time to the Storyboard DevTools extension via WebSockets, with opt-in client-server clock synchronization. Even more: control the level of detail you get from various parts of your server remotely, without relaunching. Ask for authentication to see server logs; hook up your own auth function. Attach anything to your logs for further investigation. Integrate your app with Storyboard's flexible plugin architecture. Several plugins are available out of the box: Console, WebSocket Server & Client, File, (PostgreSQL) Database, and Browser Extension, with more coming up. Just use what you need: most features are optional! Give logs source and severity attributes and apply coarse- or fine-grained filtering, with white and black lists. Use color to highlight what's important. Storyboard extends the popular chalk library so that it can also be used on the browser. Enjoy the simple-yet-powerful API (I hope!). Installation To add the Storyboard library to your project: $ npm install --save storyboard If you only need the CLI tool, see this section. To install the Storyboard DevTools Chrome extension, get it from the Chrome Web Store. Optional, but highly recommended! After installing it, open the Storyboard pane in the Chrome DevTools and point your browser to a Storyboard-equipped page (see below for how to use the library). Feel free to check out the example: just clone the repo and run npm install && npm run buildExample && npm run example. You can also test-drive the PostgreSQL Database listener with npm run exampleWithDb, but make sure you run these SQL scripts before on your DB and customize the connection parameters. CLI tool Hopefully the next sections will convince you of the benefits of adding Storyboard to your project. If you don't want to modify your existing application but still want to use the Storyboard DevTools or other Storyboard features, you can use the sb CLI tool: $ npm install -g storyboard $ sb --server ls  2016-07-15T17:26:33.974Z           storyboard INFO  ┌── ROOT STORY [CREATED] 2016-07-15T17:26:33.975Z           storyboard INFO  Log filter: *:DEBUG 2016-07-15T17:26:34.151Z           storyboard INFO  Logs available via web on port 8090 2016-07-15T17:26:34.154Z                 main INFO  CHANGELOG.md 2016-07-15T17:26:34.155Z                 main INFO  LICENSE 2016-07-15T17:26:34.155Z                 main INFO  README.md 2016-07-15T17:26:34.155Z                 main INFO  ROADMAP.md 2016-07-15T17:26:34.155Z                 main INFO  chromeExtension 2016-07-15T17:26:34.155Z                 main INFO  coverage ...

As seen above, we recommend using the popular chalk library by Sindre Sorhus. Chalk is automatically extended by Storyboard for use in the browser. If you prefer another ANSI-color library, make sure it's universal and doesn't disable itself in the browser. Attachments Attach anything to your logs that might provide additional context: an object, an array, an exception, a simple value... Don't worry about circular references, buffers, or undefined! Use the attach option to display it as a tree, or attachInline for a more compact, JSON.stringify-ed version. You can also use the attachLevel option to control the (severity) level of the detailed object logs (by default: the same level of the main logged line). Pro tip: use the trace level for long attachments (hidden by default), so that they don't pollute your console but are still accessible via the Storyboard DevTools extension. mainStory.info('test', 'A simple object', { attachInline: obj1 }); // 2016-03-09T16:51:16.436Z           test INFO  A simple object -- {""foo"":2,""bar"":3} mainStory.info('test', 'An object with a circular reference', {   attach: obj2,    attachLevel: 'debug', }); // 2016-03-09T16:52:48.882Z           test INFO  An object with a circular reference // 2016-03-09T16:52:48.882Z           test DEBUG   foo: 2 // 2016-03-09T16:52:48.882Z           test DEBUG   bar: 3 // 2016-03-09T16:52:48.882Z           test DEBUG   circularRef: [CIRCULAR] Note: attach and attachInline have no effect on the way attachments are shown in the Storyboard DevTools. Log filtering Inspired by the popular debug library, Storyboard allows you to filter logs according to source, specifying white and black lists and using wildcards. Beyond that, you can specify the minimum severity level you are interested in, depending on the source: *:DEBUG (default) or * will include logs from all sources, as long as they have severity debug or higher. *:* will include absolutely all logs. foo or foo:DEBUG will include logs from foo but exclude all other sources. -test, *:* will include all logs, except those from source test. foo, bar:INFO, -test, *:WARN will include logs from foo (DEBUG or higher), bar (INFO or higher), and all other sources (WARN or higher), but exclude source test. ba*:*, -basket will include all logs from bar, baz, etc. but exclude source basket. In Node, you can configure log filtering via the STORYBOARD environment variable (have a look at cross-env for a cross-platform setup): # OS X / Linux $ STORYBOARD=*:* node myScript  # Windows $ set ""STORYBOARD=*:*"" && node myScript In the browser, use localStorage: localStorage.STORYBOARD = '*:*' Alternatively, you can configure the log filters programatically: import storyboard from 'storyboard'; storyboard.config({ filter: '*:*' }); And even more convenient: configure filters remotely and without reloading by using the Storyboard DevTools. Children stories Create child stories by calling child() on the parent story and passing an options argument. Don't forget to close() the child story when you're done with it! More on child stories here. const story = mainStory.child({   src: 'lib',   title: 'Little Red Riding Hood',   level: 'DEBUG', }); story.info('Once upon a time...'); story.warn('...a wolf appeared!...'); story.info('...and they lived happily ever after.'); story.close(); // 2016-03-19T14:10:14.080Z        lib DEBUG ┌── Little Red Riding Hood [CREATED] // 2016-03-19T14:10:14.083Z       main INFO  Once upon a time... // 2016-03-19T14:10:14.085Z       main WARN  ...a wolf appeared!... // 2016-03-19T14:10:14.087Z       main INFO  ...and they lived happily ever after. // 2016-03-19T14:10:14.088Z        lib DEBUG └── Little Red Riding Hood [CLOSED] Pro tip: Child stories have INFO level by default, and can be completely hidden by log filtering. However, when a log with level WARN or higher is added to a hidden story, the story and all of its ancestors will become visible. You will not miss any errors, nor the actions that led to them! Listeners (plugins) Logs emitted by stories are relayed by the Storyboard Hub to all attached listeners. A Hub exists at the core of every Storyboard instance. Here is an example of a typical configuration, with a server-side Hub and a client-side Hub (other use cases have proved possible in production): << Figure TBC >> Several listeners come built-in (check out their configuration options, as well as the following sections): Console: formats logs and sends them to console.log or console.error. You've already seen this listener in action above. WebSocket Server: encapsulates logs and pushes them in real time to WebSocket clients. Used jointly with the WebSocket Client and Browser Extension, it allows remote access to server stories. WebSocket Client: downloads server logs from the WebSocket Server, and optionally uploads client logs to the server for remote monitoring. Browser Extension: relays logs to the Storyboard DevTools. File: saves logs to file. PostgreSQL Database: saves logs to a PostgreSQL database for later retrieval, including (serialized) attachments, story hierarchy, etc. More listeners can be added by the user (see the API), e.g. to support different databases, integrate with other services, etc. Get inspired by winston's and bunyan's plugins. PRs are welcome! Note this breaking change in v2.0.0: Storyboard no longer enables listeners (plugins) by default, so you will need to do this manually upon startup. Remote access to server stories Standalone log server The simplest way to add remote access to a Node application's logs is to enable the WebSocket Server listener: // Server import { addListener } from 'storyboard'; import wsServerListener from 'storyboard/lib/listeners/wsServer'; addListener(wsServerListener); You now have a standalone HTTP server at port 8090 (by default) and can use the Storyboard DevTools to see your logs. If you wish, you can add authentication: addListener(wsServerListener, {   authenticate: ({ login, password }) => isAuthorized(login, password), }); Integrated log server You can also integrate the log server functionality with your own application server. This may be desirable if you want to use a single port, or if you want to see end-to-end stories. In this case, your client application should enable the WebSocket Client listener and Browser Extension listener: // Client import { addListener } from 'storyboard'; import wsClientListener from 'storyboard/lib/listeners/wsClient'; import browserExtListener from 'storyboard/lib/listeners/browserExtension'; addListener(wsClientListener); addListener(browserExtListener); At the server side, initialize the WebSocket Server listener with either your http Server instance, or your socket.io Server instance, depending on your case: // If your application doesn't use WebSockets: import express from 'express'; import http from 'http'; const httpServer = http.createServer(express()); httpServer.listen(3000); addListener(wsServerListener, { httpServer });  // If your application uses socket.io WebSockets without socket auth: import socketio from 'socket.io'; const socketServer = socketio(httpServer); addListener(wsServerListener, { socketServer });  // If your application uses sockets with auth, namespace them // so that they don't clash with the log server's: // At the server... const io = socketServer.of('/myApp'); io.use(myAuthMiddleware); io.on('connection', myConnectFunction); // ...and at the client: const socket = socketio.connect('/myApp') Now when you open your client-side application, you can see both server and client logs in the Storyboard DevTools. Remote access to client stories In some cases, you may want to remotely monitor client logs, e.g. if you are building a mobile web app, or you want to see the logs generated in non-Chrome browsers for which there is (currently) no browser extension. For these cases, you can configure your WebSocket Client listener so that it uploads its logs to the server, which can then provide remote access to them: import { addListener } from 'storyboard'; import wsClientListener from 'storyboard/lib/listeners/wsClient'; addListener(wsClientListener, { uploadClientStories: true }); Client logs will not pollute the server's own log, and will appear under a dedicated browser root story in the Storyboard DevTools, along with a short description of the remote client's platform: End-to-end stories The icing on the cake is linking server- and client-side stories to get a complete picture of what is triggered by a user action (see video at the top of this page). Storyboard provides a simple yet flexible way to achieve this: stories can have multiple parents, which are specified upon creation. This feature is leveraged by the Storyboard DevTools: when it receives a new story from the server with multiple parents, it checks whether any of the parents is a client-side story. If so, it prioritizes this parent for display purposes, since it is expected to provide more context. For this to work, the client's storyId must be transmitted to the server somehow. This example uses the URL query string for simplicity, but feel free to use whatever technique you want (the body of a POST request, your own WebSocket messaging scheme, etc.): // Client: const story = mainStory.child({   src: 'itemList',   title: 'User click on Refresh', }); story.info('itemList', 'Fetching items...'); fetch(`/items?storyId=${story.storyId}`) .then(response => response.json()) .then(items => story.info('itemList', `Fetched ${items.length} items`)) .finally(() => story.close());  // using Bluebird's terse API  // Server (using Express): import express from 'express'; const app = express(); app.get('/items', (req, res) => {   const { storyId } = req.query;   const story = mainStory.child({     src: 'http',      title: `HTTP request ${req.url}`,     extraParents: storyId != null ? [storyId] : undefined,   });   story.info('http', 'Processing request...');   // ...   res.json(items);   story.close(); }); Want to see the end-to-end story? Use the Storyboard DevTools extension. Note: end-to-end stories work better when server and client system clocks are not too different. Servers are typically NTP-synchronized, as are most modern PCs with Internet access. If this is not the case, enable Storyboard 2.x's time synchronisation function: import { addListener } from 'storyboard'; import wsClientListener from 'storyboard/lib/listeners/wsClient'; addListener(wsClientListener, { clockSync: true }); Storyboard DevTools Enable the link to the browser extension in your application: import { addListener } from 'storyboard'; import browserExtListener from 'storyboard/lib/listeners/browserExtension'; addListener(browserExtListener); After installing the Chrome extension, open the Chrome DevTools, select the Storyboard pane and point your browser at either: Your standard application URL, to see both server and client logs Port 8090 (configurable) of your server, to see server logs only (+ uploaded client logs) Some highlighted features: Modify the server's filter configuration without restarting it. Show a story chronologically (flat) or hierarchically (tree): hover on the story title for the button to appear. Collapse/expand stories: click on the caret. Even when stories are collapsed, detect that they contain an error or warning thanks to a special icon. Open attachments and exceptions: click on the folder icon. Choose among 3 timestamp formats: UTC, local or relative to now: click on any timestamp. Use quick find (case-insensitive) to highlight what you're looking for. See how identical, consecutive messages get squashed into a convenient summary line. Configure when and how Storyboard forgets old logs and stories. You can check out your new extension navigating to: http://storyboard-demo.herokuapp.com/ Storyboard DevTools is built with React, Redux and Redux-Saga.

About My name is Firas Dib, a developer from Sweden in my mid 20s finishing my final exams to take my masters in computer engineering. Regex101 has been my hobby project for a couple of years now and I've seen it go from unknown to one of the largest regex testing services on the web. This makes me very happy and is my motivation to continue working on it and making it even better. I will continue to host website for the forseeable future, and maintain it for as much as I can. I have been considering making it open source, so you don't need to ask me or open an issue about it. Disclaimers Anyone, including companies, can use my service freely. What I ask of you is to not redistrubute my code as your own without my permission. The expressions and data you save will be saved in a MySQL database. Your private information used to sign in is not stored on my server. If you have any sensitive information that you don't want to leak out, don't save it as it will end up on my server. I have no plans of ever clearing the database (unless it grows incredibly large, which it hasn't) which means the expressions you save should last forever.

Regular Expressions are created by using chained methods and variables such as arrays or strings. How to start There are implementations available for Javascript and Java. Examples Here are a couple of examples using Javascript: var r = require('regexpbuilder');  Money var regex = r   .find(""$"")   .min(1).digits()   .then(""."")   .digit()   .digit()   .getRegExp();  regex.test(""$10.00""); // true  Nested patterns var pattern = r   .min(1).of(""p"")   .min(2).of(""q"");  var regex = r   .exactly(2).like(pattern)   .getRegExp();  regex.test(""pqqpqq""); // true  API documentation RegExpBuilder can represent literally every possible regular expression using methods such as either(), or(), behind(), asGroup() and so on.

When dealing with services with limited resources, it's important to ensure that they don't become overloaded. Bottleneck is the easiest solution as it doesn't add much complexity to the code. It's battle-hardened, reliable and production-ready. It's used on a large scale in both private companies and open source software. Install Node npm install bottleneck  Browser bower install bottleneck  or <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""bottleneck.min.js""></script> Example Most APIs have a rate limit. For example, the Reddit.com API limits programs to 1 request every 2 seconds. var Bottleneck = require(""bottleneck""); //Node only  // Never more than 1 request running at a time. // Wait at least 2000ms between each request. var limiter = new Bottleneck(1, 2000); Instead of doing someAsyncCall(arg1, arg2, argN, callback); You do limiter.submit(someAsyncCall, arg1, arg2, argN, callback); And now you can be assured that someAsyncCall will abide by your rate guidelines! Promise users can use schedule(). Bottleneck builds a queue of requests and executes them as soon as possible. All the requests will be executed in the order that they were received. See priorities if you wish to alter this behavior. This is sufficient for the vast majority of applications. Read the Gotchas section and you're good to go. Or keep reading to learn about all the fine tuning available for the more complex use cases. Docs Constructor var limiter = new Bottleneck(maxConcurrent, minTime, highWater, strategy, rejectOnDrop); maxConcurrent : How many requests can be running at the same time. Default: 0 (unlimited) minTime : How long to wait after launching a request before launching another one. Default: 0ms highWater : How long can the queue get? Default: -1 (unlimited) strategy : Which strategy to use if the queue gets longer than the high water mark. Default: Bottleneck.strategy.LEAK. rejectOnDrop : When true if a job is dropped its callback will be called with the first argument set to an Error object. If the job was a promise it will be rejected. Default: false submit() Adds a request to the queue. limiter.submit(someAsyncCall, arg1, arg2, argN, callback); It returns true if the strategy was executed. schedule() Adds a request to the queue. This is the Promise version of submit. It uses the bluebird package if installed and otherwise uses the built-in Promise object. var fn = function(arg1, arg2, argN) {     return httpGet(arg1, arg2, argN); // Here httpGet() returns a promise };  limiter.schedule(fn, arg1, arg2, argN); // This also returns a promise, for chaining In plain language, schedule takes a function fn and a list of arguments. Fn must return a promise. schedule returns a promise that will be executed according to the rate limits. It's safe to mix submit and schedule in the same limiter. Here's another example, this time using the ECMAScript 7 syntax: // fn returns a promise function fn (url) {     return http.get(url).then(response => console.log(response.body)); }  limiter.schedule(fn, url); It's also possible to replace the Promise library used: var Bottleneck = require(""bottleneck""); Bottleneck.prototype.Promise = myPromiseLibrary;  var limiter = new Bottleneck(maxConcurrent, minTime, highWater, strategy); Gotchas When using submit, if a callback isn't necessary, you must pass null or an empty function instead. It will not work if you forget to do this. Make sure that all the requests will eventually complete by calling their callback (or resolving/rejecting in the case of promises). Again, even if you submitted your request with a null callback , it still needs to call its callback. This is very important if you are using a maxConcurrent value that isn't 0 (unlimited), otherwise those uncompleted requests will be clogging up the limiter and no new requests will be getting through. It's safe to call the callback more than once, subsequent calls are ignored. If you want to rate limit a synchronous function (`console.log(), for example), you must wrap it in a closure to make it asynchronous. See this example. Priorities Every request has a priority level. It's 5 for every request added with submit/schedule. There exists a variant of those functions that lets you set the priority of a request. Priority 0 is the most important and 9 is the least important. More important requests will always be executed before less important ones. For requests with the same priority level, the oldest one is executed first. submitPriority() limiter.submitPriority(priority, someAsyncCall, arg1, arg2, argN, cb); schedulePriority() limiter.schedulePriority(priority, fn, arg1, arg2, argN); Strategies A strategy is a simple algorithm that is executed every time adding a request would cause the number of queued requests to exceed highWater. See Events. Bottleneck.strategy.LEAK When submitting a new request, if the queue length reaches highWater, drop the oldest request with the lowest priority. This is useful when requests that have been waiting for too long are not important anymore. If all the queued up requests are more important than the one being added, it won't be added. Bottleneck.strategy.OVERFLOW_PRIORITY Same as LEAK, except that it will only drop requests that are less important than the one being added. If all the queued up requests are as important or more than the new one, it won't be added. Bottleneck.strategy.OVERFLOW When submitting a new request, if the queue length reaches highWater, do not add the new request. This strategy totally ignores priority levels. Bottleneck.strategy.BLOCK When submitting a new request, if the queue length reaches highWater, the limiter falls into ""blocked mode"". All queued requests are dropped and no new requests will be accepted until the limiter unblocks. It will unblock after penalty milliseconds have passed without receiving a new request. penalty is equal to 15 * minTime (or 5000 if minTime is 0) by default and can be changed by calling changePenalty(). This strategy is ideal when bruteforce attacks are to be expected. This strategy totally ignores priority levels. nbQueued() limiter.nbQueued(priority); priority is optional. Without that argument, it'll return the total number of requests waiting to be executed, otherwise it'll only count the number of requests with that specific priority. check() limiter.check(); If a request was added right now, would it be run immediately? Returns a boolean. isBlocked() limiter.isBlocked(); Is the limiter currently in ""blocked mode""? Returns a boolean. stopAll() limiter.stopAll(interrupt); Cancels all queued up requests and prevents additonal requests from being added. interrupt : If true, prevent the requests currently running from calling their callback when they're done. Default: false Events Event names: empty, dropped. limiter.on('empty', function () {   // This will be called when the nbQueued() drops to 0. }) limiter.on('dropped', function (dropped) {   // This will be called when a strategy was triggered.   // The dropped request is passed to this callback. }) Note: It's possible to set multiple callbacks to the same event name. changeSettings() limiter.changeSettings(maxConcurrent, minTime, highWater, strategy); Same parameters as the constructor, pass null to skip a parameter and keep it to its current value. Note: Changing maxConcurrent and minTime will not affect requests that have already been scheduled for execution. For example, imagine that three 60-second requests are submitted at time T with maxConcurrent = 0 and minTime = 2000. The requests will be launched at T seconds, T+2 seconds and T+4 seconds respectively. If right after adding the requests to Bottleneck, you were to call limiter.changeSettings(1);, it won't change the fact that there will be 3 requests running at the same time for roughly 60 seconds. Once again, changeSettings only affects requests that have not yet been added. This is by design, as Bottleneck made a promise to execute those requests according to the settings valid at the time. Changing settings afterwards should not break previous assumptions, as that would make code very error-prone and Bottleneck a tool that cannot be relied upon. changePenalty() limiter.changePenalty(penalty); This changes the penalty value used by the BLOCK strategy. changeReservoir(), incrementReservoir() limiter.changeReservoir(reservoir);  limiter.incrementReservoir(incrementBy); reservoir : How many requests can be executed before the limiter stops executing requests. Default: null (unlimited) If reservoir reaches 0, no new requests will be executed until it is no more 0 chain() limiter : If another limiter is passed, tasks that are ready to be executed will be added to that other limiter. Default: null (none) Suppose you have 2 types of tasks, A and B. They both have their own limiter with their own settings, but both must also follow a global limiter C: var limiterA = new Bottleneck(...some settings...); var limiterB = new Bottleneck(...some different settings...); var limiterC = new Bottleneck(...some global settings...); limiterA.chain(limiterC); limiterB.chain(limiterC); // Requests added to limiterA must follow the A and C rate limits. // Requests added to limiterB must follow the B and C rate limits. // Requests added to limiterC must follow the C rate limits. Execution guarantee Bottleneck will execute every request in order of priority first, oldest to youngest within each priority level. You can be certain that they will all eventually be executed as long as: highWater is set to -1 (default), which prevents the strategy from ever being run OR you never exceed the highWater. maxConcurrent is set to 0 (default) OR all requests call the callback eventually (in the case of promises, they must be resolved or rejected eventually). reservoir is null (default). Cluster The Cluster feature of Bottleneck manages many limiters automatically for you. It creates limiters dynamically and transparently. Let's take a DNS server as an example of how Bottleneck can be used. It's a service that sees a lot of abuse and where incoming DNS requests need to be rate limited. Bottleneck is so tiny, it's perfectly fine to create one limiter for each origin IP, even if it means creating thousands and thousands of limiters. The Cluster mode is perfect for this use case. We can create one cluster and then use the origin IP to rate limit each IP independently. Each call with the same key will be routed to the same underlying limiter. A cluster is created exactly like a limiter: var cluster = new Bottleneck.Cluster(maxConcurrent, minTime, highWater, strategy); The cluster is then used with the .key(str) method: // In this example, the key is an IP cluster.key(""77.66.54.32"").submit(someAsyncCall, arg1, arg2, cb); key() str : The key to use. All calls submitted with the same key will use the same limiter. Default: """" The return value of .key(str) is a limiter. If it doesn't already exist, it is created on the fly. Limiters that have been idle for a long time are deleted to avoid memory leaks. stopAutoCleanup() Calling stopAutoCleanup() on a cluster will turn off its garbage collection, so limiters for keys that have not been used in over 5 minutes will NOT be deleted anymore. It can be reenabled by calling startAutoCleanup(). startAutoCleanup() Reactivate the cluster's garbage collection for limiters (in the cluster) that have been inactive for over 5 minutes. deleteKey() str: The key for the limiter to delete. Manually deletes the limiter at the specified key. This can be useful when the auto cleanup is turned off. all() cb : A function to be executed on every limiter in the cluster. For example, this will call stopAll() on every limiter in the cluster: cluster.all(function(limiter){   limiter.stopAll(); });  keys() Returns an array containing all the keys in the cluster. Rate-limiting synchronous functions Most of the time, using Bottleneck is as simple as the first example above. However, when Bottleneck is used on a synchronous call, it (obviously) becomes asynchronous, so the returned value of that call can't be used directly. The following example should make it clear why. This is the original code that we want to rate-limit: var req = http.request(options, function(res){   //do stuff with res }); req.write(""some string"", ""utf8""); req.end(); The following code snippet will NOT work, because http.request is not executed synchronously therefore req doesn't contain the expected request object. // DOES NOT WORK var req = limiter.submit(http.request, options, function(res){   //do stuff with res }); req.write(""some string"", ""utf8""); req.end(); This is the right way to do it: limiter.submit(function(cb){   var req = http.request(options, function(res){     //do stuff with res     cb();   });   req.write(""some string"", ""utf8"");   req.end(); }, null); Contributing This README file is always in need of better explanations and examples.

Simply configure it once with your API schema, and easily do GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests with minimal effort and a consistent API. Examples: // GET store.get('users').done(function() { ... });  // POST store.add('teams', {'name': 'Lincoln Loop', 'active': true}).done(function() { ... }); How it works 1. INSTALL NPM/Browserify npm install amygdala. Bower bower install amygdala Browser Download the latest amygdala.js file. Minified/build version coming soon. Dependencies: lodash: ^3.10.1 q: ^1.0.1 Wolfy87/EventEmitter: ^4.2.6 2. SETUP To create a new store, define the few possible settings listed below and your API schema. var store = new Amygdala({   'config': {     'apiUrl': 'http://localhost:8000',     'idAttribute': 'url',     'headers': {       'X-CSRFToken': getCookie('csrftoken')     },     'localStorage': true   },   'schema': {     'users': {       'url': '/api/v2/user/'     },     'teams': {       'url': '/api/v2/team/',       'orderBy': 'name',       'oneToMany': {         'members': 'members'       },       parse: function(data) {         return data.results ? data.results : data;       },     },     'members': {       'foreignKey': {         'user': 'users'       }     }   } }); Configuration options: apiUrl - Full path to your base API url (required). idAttribute - global primary key attribute (required). headers - Any headers that you need to pass on each API request. localStorage - enable/disable the persistent localStorage cache. Schema options: url - relative path for each ""table"" (required) orderBy - order by which you want to retrieve local cached data. eg (name, -name (for reverse)) parse - Accepts a parse method for cases when your API also returns extra meta data. idAttribute - overrides key attribute (if different in this schema) Schema relations: When you want to include related data under a single request, for example, to minimize HTTP requests, having schema relations allows you to still have a clean separation when interacting with the data locally. Consider the following schema, that defines discussions that have messages, and messages that have votes: var store = new Amygdala({     'config': {       'apiUrl': 'http://localhost:8000',       'idAttribute': 'url'     },     'schema': {       'discussions': {         'url': '/api/v2/discussion/',         'oneToMany': {           'children': 'messages'         }       },       'messages': {         'url': '/api/v2/message/',         'oneToMany': {           'votes': 'votes'         },         'foreignKey': {           'discussion': 'discussions'         }       },       'votes': {         'url': '/api/v2/vote/'       }     }   } ); In this scenario, doing a query on a discussion will retrieve all messages and votes for that discussion: store.get('discussions', {'url': '/api/v2/discussion/85273/'}).then(function(){ ... }); Since we defined relations on our schema, the message and vote data won't be stored on the discussion ""table"", but on it's own ""table"" instead. OneToMany: 'oneToMany': {   'children': 'messages' } OneToMany relations are the most common, and should be used when you have related data in form of an array. In this case, children is the attribute name on the response, and messages is the destination ""table"" for the array data. foreignKey: 'foreignKey': {   'discussion': 'discussions' } foreignKey relations are basically for one to one relations. In this case Amygdala will look for an object as value of discussion and move it over to the discussions ""table"" if one is found. 3. USAGE Querying the remote API server: The methods below, allow you to make remote calls to your API server. // GET store.get('users').done(function() { ... });  // POST store.add('teams', {'name': 'Lincoln Loop', 'active': true}).done(function() { ... });  // PUT store.update('users', {'url': '/api/v2/user/32/', 'username': 'amy82', 'active': true}).done(function() { ... });  // DELETE store.remove('users', {'url': '/api/v2/user/32/'}).done(function() { ... }); In memory storage API: On top of this, Amygdala also stores a copy of your data locally, which you can access through a couple different methods: Find and filtering: // Get the list of active users from memory var users = store.findAll('users', {'active': true});  // Get a single user from memory var user = store.find('users', {'username': 'amy82'});  // Get a single user by id for memory var user = store.find('users', 1103747470); If you enable localStorage, the data is kept persistently. Because of this, once you instantiate Amygdala, your cached data will be loaded, and you can use it right away without having to wait for the remote calls. (We do not recommend using localStorage for production yet) Fetching related data: By defining your schema and creating relations between data, you are then able to query your data objects for the related objects. In the example schema above, discussions have a oneToMany relation with messages, and messages have a foreignKey relation back to discussions. This is how it you can use them. // Fetching related messages for a discussion (oneToMay) var messages = store.find('discussions', '/api/v2/discussion/85273/').getRelated('messages');  // Getting the discussion object from a message (foreignKey) var discussion = store.find('message', '/api/v2/message/81273/').getRelated('discussion'); Note that Amygdala doesn't fetch data automagically for you here, so it's up you to fetch it before running the query. Events Amygdala uses Wolfy87/EventEmitter under the hood to trigger some very basic events. Right now it only triggers two different events: change change:type To listen to these events, you can use any of Event Emitter's binding methods or the aliases, the most common one being on: // Listen to any change in the store store.on('change', function() { ... });  // Listen to any change of a specific type store.on('change:users', function() { ... }); Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Below denoted as client. client.add( name, [ options ] ) Instaniates a nested resource on client. Internally this does another new $.RestClient though instead of setting it as root, it will add it as a nested (or child) resource as a property on the current client. Newly created nested resources iterate through their options.verbs and addVerb on each. Note: The url of each of these verbs is set to """". See default options.verbs here. client.addVerb( name, method, [ options ] ) Instaniates a new Verb function property on the client. Note: name is used as the url if options.url is not set. client.verb( [id1], ..., [idN], [data], [params]) All verbs use this signature. Internally, they are all essentially calls to $.ajax with custom options depending on the parent client and options. ids must be a string or number. data is a jQuery Ajax Options Object's data property. If ajax.data is set on the client this data will extend it. params query parameters to be appended to the url Note: A helpful error will be thrown if invalid arguments are used. Options The options object is a plain JavaScript option that may only contain the properties listed below. See defaults here Important: Both resources and verbs inherit their parent's options ! cache A number reprenting the number of seconds to used previously cached requests. When set to 0, no requests are stored. cachableMethods An array of strings reprenting the HTTP method types that can be cached. Is [""GET""] by default. verbs A plain object used as a name to method mapping. The default verbs object is set to: {   'create': 'POST',   'read'  : 'GET',   'update': 'PUT',   'delete': 'DELETE' } For example, to change the default behaviour of update from using PUT to instead use POST, set the verbs property to { update: 'POST' } url A string representing the URL for the given resource or verb. Note: url is not inherited, if it is not set explicitly, the name is used as the URL. stringifyData When true, will pass all POST data through JSON.stringify (polyfill required for IE<=8). stripTrailingSlash When true, the trailing slash will be stripped off the URL. username and password When both username and password are set, all ajax requests will add an 'Authorization' header. Encoded using btoa (polyfill required not non-webkit). ajax The jQuery Ajax Options Object methodOverride When true, requests (excluding HEAD and GET) become POST requests and the method chosen will be set as the header: X-HTTP-Method-Override. Useful for clients and/or servers that don't support certain HTTP methods. request The function used to perform the request (must return a jQuery Deferred). By default, it is: request: function(resource, options) {   return $.ajax(options); } isSingle When true, resource is perceived as singleton: See Singleton Resource Example autoClearCache When false, non-cachable requests (PUT, POST or DELETE - those not in cachableMethods) won't automatically clear the request's entry in the cache. Note: Want more options ? Open up a New Feature Issue above. Conceptual Overview This plugin is made up nested 'Resource' classes. Resources contain options, child Resources and child Verbs. Verbs are functions that execute various HTTP requests. Both new $.RestClient and client.add construct new instances of Resource, however the former will create a root Resource with no Verbs attached, whereas the latter will create child Resources with all of it's options.verbs attached. Since each Resource can have it's own set of options, at instantiation time, options are inherited from parent Resources, allowing one default set of options with custom options on child Resources.

After all, we all would like to think that there's some ulterior motive to fulfilling that prophecy. On tablet or other touchscreen devices- of which there are quite a number of nowadays (as the New Year's Eve post, I am obliged to include conjecture about the technological zeitgeist), a library such as Ocrad.js might be used to add handwriting input in a device and operating system agnostic manner. Oftentimes, capturing the strokes and sending them over to a server to process might entail unacceptably high latency. Maybe you're working on an offline-capable note-taking app, or a browser extension which indexes all the doge memes that you stumble upon while prawling the dark corners of the internet. If you've been following my trail of blog posts recently, you'd probably be able to tell that I've been scrambling to finish the program that I prototyped many months ago overnight at a Hackathon. The idea of the extension was kind of simple and also kind of magical: a browser extension that allowed users to highlight, copy, and paste text from any image as if it were plain text. Of course the implementation is a bit difficult and actually relies on the advent of a number of newfangled technologies. If you try to search for some open source text recognition engine, the first thing that comes up is Tesseract. That isn't a mistake, because it turns out that the competition is worlds away in terms of accuracy. It's actually pretty sad that the state of the art hasn't progressed substantially since the mid-nineties. A month ago, I tried compiling Tesseract using Emscripten. Perhaps it was a bad thing to try first, but soon I learned that even if it did work out, it probably wouldn't have been practical anyway. I had figured that all OCR engines had been powered by artificial neural networks, support vector machines, k-nearest-neighbors and their machine learning kin. It turns out that this is hardly the norm except in the realm of the actually-accurate, whose open source provinces live under the protection of Lord Tesseract. GOCR and Ocrad are essentially the only other open source OCR engines (there's technically also Cuneiform, but the source code is in a really really big zip file from some website in Russian and its also really slow according to benchmarks). And something I didn't realize until I had peered into the source code is that they are powered by (presumably) painstakingly written rules for each and every detectable glyph and variation. This kind of blew my mind. Anyway, I tried to compile GOCR first and was immediately struck by how easy and painless it had been. I was on a roll, and decided to do Ocrad as well. It wasn't particularly hard- sure it was slightly more involved but still hardly anything. If you know me in person, you'll probably know that I'm not a terribly decisive person. Oftentimes, I'll delay the decision until there isn't a choice left for me to make. Anyway, serially-indecisive-me strikes again, so I alternated between the development of GOCR.js and Ocrad.js, leading up to a simultaneous release. But in the back of my mind, I knew that eventually I would have to pick one for building my image highlighting project. What consistently amazes me about Optical Character Recognition isn't its astonishing quality or lack thereof. Rather, it's how utterly unpredictable the results can be. Sometimes there'll be some barely legible block of text that comes through absolutely pristine, and some other time there will be a perfectly clean input which outputs complete garbage. Maybe this is a testament to the sheer difficulty of computer vision or the incredible and underappreciated abilities of the human visual cortex. At one point, I was talking to someone and I distinctly remembered (I know, all the best stories start this way) a sense of surprise when the person indicated that he had heard of Tesseract, the open source OCR engine. I had appraised it as somewhat more obscure than it evidently was. Some time later, I confided about the incident with a friend, and he said something along the lines of ""OCR is one of those fields that everyone comes across once"". I guess I've kind of held onto that thought for a while now, and it certainly seems to have at least a grain of truth. Text embedded into the physical world is more or less our primary means we have for communication and expression. Technology is about building tools that augment human capacity and inevitably entails supplanting some human capability. Data input is a huge bottleneck, and while we're kind of sidestepping the problem with things like QR codes by bringing the digital world into the physical. OCR is just one of those fundamental enabling technologies which ought to be as broad in scope as the set of humans who have interacted with a keyboard. I can't help but feel that the rather large set of people who have interacted with the problem character recognition have surveyed the available tools and reached the same conclusion as your miniature Magic 8 Ball desk ornament: ""Try again later"". It doesn't take long for one to discover an instance of perfectly crisp and legible type which results in line noise of such entropy that it'd give DUAL_EC_DRBG a run for its money. ""No, there really isn't any way for this to be the state of the art."" ""Well, I guess if it is, then maybe it'll improve in a few years- technology improves quickly, right?"" You would think that some analogue of Linus's Law would hold true: ""given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow""- especially if you're dealing with literal eyeballs reading letters. But incidentally, the engine that absolutely everyone uses was developed three decades ago (It's older than I am!), abandoned for a decade before being acquired and released to the world (by our favorite benevolent overlords, Google). In fact, what's absolutely stunning is the sheer universality of Tesseract. Just about everything which claims to have text recognition as a feature is backed by it. At one point, I was hoping that Mathematica had some clever routine using morphology and symbolic new kinds of sciences and evolved automata pattern recognition. Nope! Nestled deep within the gigabytes of code lies the Chuck Testa of textadermies: Tesseract. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Matcha allow you to design experiments that will measure the performance of your code. It is recommended that each bench focus on a specific point of impact in your application. Installation Matcha is available on npm.   $ npm install matcha  Writing Async Benchmarks Though suites/benches are executed serially, the benches themselves can be asyncronous. Furthermore, suites ran with the matcha command line runner have a number of globals to simplify bench definitions. Take the following code, for example: suite('Make Tea', function () {   var tea = new CupOfTea('green');    bench('boil water', function(next) {     tea.boil('85℃', function (err, h20) {       // perfect temperature!       next();     });   });    // add tea, pour, ...      bench('sip tea', function() {     tea.sip('mmmm');   }); }); Async vs. Sync Since boiling water takes time, a next function was provided to each iteration in our bench to be called when the async function completes. Since the consumption of tea provides instant gratification, no next needed to be provided, even though we still wish to measure it. Setup/Teardown Arbitray functions may be specified for setup or teardown for each suite by using the before and after keywords. These function may be sync or async. suite('DB', function() {   before(function(next) {     db.connect('localhost:9090', next);   });    bench(function(next) {     // ...   });    after(function() {     db.close();   }); }); Setting Options As not all code is equal, we need a way to change the running conditions for our benches. Options can currently be changed for any given suite, and will be retained for any nested suites or benches of that suite. To set an option: suite('Make Tea', function () {   set('iterations', 10000);   set('type', 'static');   // ... Defaults Here are all available options and the default values: set('iterations', 100);     // the number of times to run a given bench set('concurrency', 1);      // the number of how many times a given bench is run concurrently set('type', 'adaptive');    // or 'static' (see below) set('mintime', 500);        // when adaptive, the minimum time in ms a bench should run set('delay', 100);          // time in ms between each bench Static vs Adaptive There are two modes for running your benches: 'static' and 'adaptive'. Static mode will run exactly the set number of iterations. Adaptive will run the set iterations, then if a minimal time elapsed has not passed, will run more another set of iterations, then check again (and repeat) until the requirement has been satisfied. Running Benchmarks Running of your benchmarks is provided through ./bin/matcha. The recommended approach is to add a devDependancy in your package.json and then add a line to a Makefile or build tool. The matcha bin will accept a list of files to load or will look in the current working directory for a folder named benchmark and load all files.   $ matcha suite1.js suite2.js  Options     -h, --help               view matcha usage information     -v, --version            view matcha version     -R, --reporter [clean]   specify the reporter to use     -I, --interface [bdd]    specify the interface to expect     --interfaces             display available interfaces     --reporters              display available reporters  -I, --interface The --interface option lets you specify the interface to use, defaulting to ""bdd"". -R, --reporter The --reporter option allows you to specify the reporter that will be used, defaulting to ""clean"". Interfaces Matcha ""interface"" system allows developers to choose their style of DSL. Shipping with bdd, and exports flavoured interfaces. bdd suite('suite name', function(){     set('iterations', 10);     bench('bench name', function(done){         some_fn(done);   }); }); exports exports['suite name'] = {     options: {       iterations: 10     },     bench: {         'bench name': function (doen) {             some_fn(done);         }     } }; Reporters Matcha reporters adjust to the terminal window. clean Good-looking default reporter with colors on the terminal screen. plain Similar to clean reporter but without colors and other ANSI sequences. csv Completely different, create csv formated rows for later processing.

It works in the browser as well as on the server. It works with pretty much any markup, doesn’t depend on any framework and has automatic language detection. Getting Started The bare minimum for using highlight.js on a web page is linking to the library along with one of the styles and calling initHighlightingOnLoad: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""/path/to/styles/default.css""> <script src=""/path/to/highlight.pack.js""></script> <script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script> This will find and highlight code inside of <pre><code> tags; it tries to detect the language automatically. If automatic detection doesn’t work for you, you can specify the language in the class attribute: <pre><code class=""html"">...</code></pre> The list of supported language classes is available in the class reference. Classes can also be prefixed with either language- or lang-. To disable highlighting altogether use the nohighlight class: <pre><code class=""nohighlight"">...</code></pre> Custom Initialization When you need a bit more control over the initialization of highlight.js, you can use the highlightBlock and configure functions. This allows you to control what to highlight and when. Here’s an equivalent way to calling initHighlightingOnLoad using jQuery: $(document).ready(function() {   $('pre code').each(function(i, block) {     hljs.highlightBlock(block);   }); }); You can use any tags instead of <pre><code> to mark up your code. If you don't use a container that preserve line breaks you will need to configure highlight.js to use the <br> tag: hljs.configure({useBR: true});  $('div.code').each(function(i, block) {   hljs.highlightBlock(block); }); For other options refer to the documentation for configure. Web Workers You can run highlighting inside a web worker to avoid freezing the browser window while dealing with very big chunks of code. In your main script: addEventListener('load', function() {   var code = document.querySelector('#code');   var worker = new Worker('worker.js');   worker.onmessage = function(event) { code.innerHTML = event.data; }   worker.postMessage(code.textContent); }) In worker.js: onmessage = function(event) {   importScripts('<path>/highlight.pack.js');   var result = self.hljs.highlightAuto(event.data);   postMessage(result.value); } Getting the Library You can get highlight.js as a hosted, or custom-build, browser script or as a server module. Right out of the box the browser script supports both AMD and CommonJS, so if you wish you can use RequireJS or Browserify without having to build from source. The server module also works perfectly fine with Browserify, but there is the option to use a build specific to browsers rather than something meant for a server. Head over to the download page for all the options. Don't link to GitHub directly. The library is not supposed to work straight from the source, it requires building. If none of the pre-packaged options work for you refer to the building documentation. The CDN-hosted package doesn't have all the languages. Otherwise it'd be too big. If you don't see the language you need in the ""Common"" section, it can be added manually: <script src=""//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.4.0/languages/go.min.js""></script> On Almond. You need to use the optimizer to give the module a name. For example: r.js -o name=hljs paths.hljs=/path/to/highlight out=highlight.js  License Highlight.js is released under the BSD License. See LICENSE file for details. Links The official site for the library is at https://highlightjs.org/.

Fix #591 Jun 12, 2015 utopia.js Commit updated line changes Aug 18, 2015 README.md Prism Prism is a lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting library. It's a spin-off project from Dabblet. You can learn more on http://prismjs.com/. Why another syntax highlighter?: http://lea.verou.me/2012/07/introducing-prism-an-awesome-new-syntax-highlighter/#more-1841 Contribute to Prism! Prism depends on community contributions to expand and cover a wider array of use cases. If you like it, considering giving back by sending a pull request. Here are a few tips: Read the documentation. Prism was designed to be extensible. Do not edit prism.js, it’s just the version of Prism used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the components/ folder. The minified files are also generated automatically. The build system uses gulp to minify the files and build prism.js. Having gulp installed, you just need to run the command gulp. Please follow the code conventions used in the files already. For example, I use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment. Opening braces are on the same line, closing braces on their own line regardless of construct. There is a space before the opening brace. etc etc. Please try to err towards more smaller PRs rather than few huge PRs. If a PR includes changes I want to merge and changes I don't, handling it becomes difficult. My time is very limited these days, so it might take a long time to review longer PRs (short ones are usually merged very quickly), especially those modifying the Prism Core. This doesn't mean your PR is rejected. If you contribute a new language definition, you will be responsible for handling bug reports about that language definition. If you add a new language definition, theme or plugin, you need to add it to components.js as well, so that it becomes available to the download build page. Thank you so much for contributing!!

It uses CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript which doesn't depend on any other libraries. Types and preview Type 1. Determinate Type 2. Buffer Type 3. Indeterminate Type 4. Query Indeterminate and Determinate Or you can see all types together: Vedio：Material Progress & activity DEMO See the Online demo How to start Install it Include mprogress.min.js and mprogress.min.css in your target html file. <link rel='stylesheet' href='mprogress.min.css'/>  <script src='mprogress.min.js'></script> You can also install it via Bower or npm: bower install --save mprogress  npm install --save mprogress  Basic usage Example for the Determinate type 1.Instantiation: var mprogress = new Mprogress(); 2.Show and start the bar by using: mprogress.start(); Or you can just use the following code to replace step 1 and 2: var mprogress = new Mprogress('start');  //start it immediately 3.Finish the loading and hide it : mprogress.end(); Advanced usage All types have start and end methods. Type1: Determinate Determinate also has set and inc methods. set(n) Sets the progress bar status, where n is a number from 0.0 to 1.0. eg: mprogress.set(0.3); inc() Increases by a random amount. eg: mprogress.inc(); // Increase the bar with a random amount. mprogress.inc(0.3); // This will get the current status value and adds 0.3 until status is 0.994 Type2: Buffer Its always used for video loading, and you can use for other case. Init Type Buffer : var bufferIntObj = {   template: 2 }; var bufferProgress = new Mprogress(bufferIntObj); Start it: bufferProgress.start(); If you want to start it immediately after instantiating it，you can use: var bufferIntObj = {   template: 2, // type number   start: true  // start it now }; var bufferProgress = new Mprogress(bufferIntObj); End it: bufferProgress.end(); Buffer also has set , inc and setBuffer methods Type Buffer has two progress: main progress and buffer progress. set(n) Sets the main progress bar status (0,1) setBuffer(num) Sets the buffer progress bar status (0,1) inc() Increases by a random amount, including buffer bar. Type3:Indeterminate Init Type Indeterminate : var intObj = {   template: 3,    parent: '#customId' // this option will insert bar HTML into this parent Element  }; var indeterminateProgress = new Mprogress(intObj); Type Indeterminate just has start and end methods. indeterminateProgress.start();  indeterminateProgress.end(); Type4:Query Indeterminate and Determinate Init Type Query : var intObj = {   template: 4,   parent: '#anothercustomId' // to other position }; var queryProgress = new Mprogress(intObj); Type Query just has start and end methods. queryProgress.start();  queryProgress.end(); Configuration Passing an object(configuration) to instantiated Mprogress var mp = new Mprogress(configuration); template Set the progress bar type. (default: 1) var mp = new Mprogress({   // vaule {    //    1: Type Determinate,   //    2: Buffer,   //    3: Indeterminate,    //    4: Query,   //  '<div>...</div>': 'yourcustomHTML'   // }   template: 2  }); parent Change the parent container where the bar is shown. (default: body) var mp = new Mprogress({   parent: '#customContainer'  }); start Start the bar immediately. (default: false) var mp = new Mprogress({   template: 4,   start: true }); For type1 Determinate, you can just use: var mp = new Mprogress('start'); Advanced Configuration trickle trickleRate trickleSpeed minimum easing positionUsing speed Browser Support Mobile First. All types work in Chrome and Firefox. Type Determinate works in all browsers. License MIT © gctang Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Inspired by Google, YouTube, and Medium. Installation Add nprogress.js and nprogress.css to your project. <script src='nprogress.js'></script> <link rel='stylesheet' href='nprogress.css'/> NProgress is available via bower and npm and spm. $ bower install --save nprogress $ npm install --save nprogress  Basic usage Simply call start() and done() to control the progress bar. NProgress.start(); NProgress.done(); Turbolinks Ensure you're using Turbolinks 1.3.0+, and use this: (explained here) $(document).on('page:fetch',   function() { NProgress.start(); }); $(document).on('page:change',  function() { NProgress.done(); }); $(document).on('page:restore', function() { NProgress.remove(); }); Pjax Try this: (explained here) $(document).on('pjax:start', function() { NProgress.start(); }); $(document).on('pjax:end',   function() { NProgress.done();  }); Ideas Add progress to your Ajax calls! Bind it to the jQuery ajaxStart and ajaxStop events. Make a fancy loading bar even without Turbolinks/Pjax! Bind it to $(document).ready and $(window).load. Advanced usage Percentages: To set a progress percentage, call .set(n), where n is a number between 0..1. NProgress.set(0.0);     // Sorta same as .start() NProgress.set(0.4); NProgress.set(1.0);     // Sorta same as .done() Incrementing: To increment the progress bar, just use .inc(). This increments it with a random amount. This will never get to 100%: use it for every image load (or similar). NProgress.inc(); If you want to increment by a specific value, you can pass that as a parameter: NProgress.inc(0.2);    // This will get the current status value and adds 0.2 until status is 0.994 Force-done: By passing true to done(), it will show the progress bar even if it's not being shown. (The default behavior is that .done() will not do anything if .start() isn't called) NProgress.done(true); Get the status value: To get the status value, use .status Configuration minimum Changes the minimum percentage used upon starting. (default: 0.08) NProgress.configure({ minimum: 0.1 }); template You can change the markup using template. To keep the progress bar working, keep an element with role='bar' in there. See the default template for reference. NProgress.configure({   template: ""<div class='....'>...</div>"" }); easing and speed Adjust animation settings using easing (a CSS easing string) and speed (in ms). (default: ease and 200) NProgress.configure({ easing: 'ease', speed: 500 }); trickle Turn off the automatic incrementing behavior by setting this to false. (default: true) NProgress.configure({ trickle: false }); trickleRate and trickleSpeed You can adjust the trickleRate (how much to increase per trickle) and trickleSpeed (how often to trickle, in ms). NProgress.configure({ trickleRate: 0.02, trickleSpeed: 800 }); showSpinner Turn off loading spinner by setting it to false. (default: true) NProgress.configure({ showSpinner: false }); parent specify this to change the parent container. (default: body) NProgress.configure({ parent: '#container' }); Customization Just edit nprogress.css to your liking. Tip: you probably only want to find and replace occurrences of #29d. The included CSS file is pretty minimal... in fact, feel free to scrap it and make your own!

SpinKit uses hardware accelerated (translate and opacity) CSS animations to create smooth and easily customizable animations. Usage Regular CSS Grab the HTML and CSS for a spinner from the example files, or add SpinKit directly to your project with bower: $ bower install spinkit or npm: $ npm install spinkit SCSS If you're using SCSS you can include specific spinners (rather than all of them) by importing them one by one: @import '../bower_components/spinkit/scss/spinners/1-rotating-plane',         '../bower_components/spinkit/scss/spinners/3-wave'; You currently need to use an autoprefixer if you want to support all browsers. If you're compiling your SCSS with gulp you can use gulp-autoprefixer, and grunt-autoprefixer if you use grunt. Variables that can be overridden are listed in scss/_variables.scss. Web browser compatibility CSS animations are supported in the latest version of all major browsers, and browsers with animation support make up almost 90% of all usage. If you need to support IE9 and below, however, this section is for you. Implementing a fallback spinner How do you know if you need to provide a fallback? You can easily check for animation support with Modernizr, or manually check for the animation property, and replace the spinner with a GIF if it's not supported: function browserSupportsCSSProperty(propertyName) {   var elm = document.createElement('div');   propertyName = propertyName.toLowerCase();    if (elm.style[propertyName] != undefined)     return true;    var propertyNameCapital = propertyName.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + propertyName.substr(1),     domPrefixes = 'Webkit Moz ms O'.split(' ');    for (var i = 0; i < domPrefixes.length; i++) {     if (elm.style[domPrefixes[i] + propertyNameCapital] != undefined)       return true;   }    return false; } Use it to check for animation support: if (!browserSupportsCSSProperty('animation')) {   // fallback… } Contributing See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

Check out the demo page. Instructions Release downloads and change history is available here https://github.com/hakimel/Ladda/releases. The compiled files for the project that you should be using are available in the /dist directory. You will need to include both the ladda.min.js and spin.min.js files as well as ONE of the two style sheets. If you want the button styles used in the Ladda example page use the ladda.min.css file, if you want to have the functional buttons without the visual style (colors, padding etc) use the ladda-themeless.min.css file. HTML Ladda buttons must be given the class ladda-button and the button label needs to have the ladda-label class. The ladda-label will be automatically created if it does not exist in the DOM. Below is an example of a button which will use the expand-right animation style. <button class=""ladda-button"" data-style=""expand-right""><span class=""ladda-label"">Submit</span></button> Buttons accept the following attributes: data-style: one of the button styles, full list in demo [required] data-color: green/red/blue/purple/mint data-size: xs/s/l/xl, defaults to medium data-spinner-size: 40, pixel dimensions of spinner, defaults to dynamic size based on the button height data-spinner-color: A hex code or any named CSS color. data-spinner-lines: 12, the number of lines the for the spinner, defaults to 12 JavaScript If you will be using the loading animation for a form that is submitted to the server (always resulting in a page reload) you can use the bind() method: // Automatically trigger the loading animation on click Ladda.bind( 'button[type=submit]' );  // Same as the above but automatically stops after two seconds Ladda.bind( 'button[type=submit]', { timeout: 2000 } ); If you want JavaScript control over your buttons you can use the following approach: // Create a new instance of ladda for the specified button var l = Ladda.create( document.querySelector( '.my-button' ) );  // Start loading l.start();  // Will display a progress bar for 50% of the button width l.setProgress( 0.5 );  // Stop loading l.stop();  // Toggle between loading/not loading states l.toggle();  // Check the current state l.isLoading();  // Delete the button's ladda instance l.remove(); All loading animations on the page can be stopped by using: Ladda.stopAll(); With jQuery If you will be using the loading animation for a form that is submitted to the server (always resulting in a page reload) you can use the ladda('bind') method: // Automatically trigger the loading animation on click $( 'button[type=submit]' ).ladda( 'bind' );  // Same as the above but automatically stops after two seconds $( 'button[type=submit]' ).ladda( 'bind', { timeout: 2000 } ); If you want JavaScript control over your buttons you can use the following approach: // Create a new instance of ladda for the specified button var l = $( '.my-button' ).ladda();  // Start loading l.ladda( 'start' );  // Will display a progress bar for 50% of the button width l.ladda( 'setProgress', 0.5 );  // Stop loading l.ladda( 'stop' );  // Toggle between loading/not loading states l.ladda( 'toggle' );  // Check the current state l.ladda( 'isLoading' ); All loading animations on the page can be stopped by using: $.ladda( 'stopAll' ); Module You can bower install ladda or npm install ladda. The spinner and Ladda can be loaded as a module using AMD. // Using Require.js define(['ladda'], function(Ladda) {     // Make Buttons Here }); Or in Common.js, you will: var ladda = require('ladda'); Browser support The project is tested in Chrome and Firefox. It Should Work™ in the current stable releases of Chrome, Firefox, Safari as well as IE9 and up.

Each spinner consists of a single div with a class of loader and content text of ""Loading..."". The text is for screen readers and can be used as a fallback state for older browsers. The aim of this project was to create a set of minimal loading spinners that are visually appealing and also convey their intended meaning. A strict limit of one element per loader (not including pseudo-elements) was placed on this project based on the belief that something as simple as a loader doesn't deserve more. Each loader is given a font size in pixels and all other sizes are in ems so to change the size of a loader, just adjust the font-size. Demo Check it live.

If you think the specification is wrong, please report the issue to them. If you have different requirements, consider using a custom method. In case you need to adjust the built-in validation regular expression patterns, please follow the documentation. License Copyright © Jörn Zaefferer Licensed under the MIT license.

If you're not sure if your input is a string, coerce it using input + ''. Passing anything other than a string is an error. Validators contains(str, seed) - check if the string contains the seed. equals(str, comparison) - check if the string matches the comparison. isAfter(str [, date]) - check if the string is a date that's after the specified date (defaults to now). isAlpha(str [, locale]) - check if the string contains only letters (a-zA-Z). Locale is one of ['ar', 'ar-AE', 'ar-BH', 'ar-DZ', 'ar-EG', 'ar-IQ', 'ar-JO', 'ar-KW', 'ar-LB', 'ar-LY', 'ar-MA', 'ar-QA', 'ar-QM', 'ar-SA', 'ar-SD', 'ar-SY', 'ar-TN', 'ar-YE', 'cs-CZ', 'de-DE', 'en-AU', 'en-GB', 'en-HK', 'en-IN', 'en-NZ', 'en-US', 'en-ZA', 'en-ZM', 'es-ES', 'fr-FR', 'hu-HU', 'nl-NL', 'pl-PL', 'pt-PT', 'ru-RU', 'tr-TR']) and defaults to en-US. isAlphanumeric(str [, locale]) - check if the string contains only letters and numbers. Locale is one of ['ar', 'ar-AE', 'ar-BH', 'ar-DZ', 'ar-EG', 'ar-IQ', 'ar-JO', 'ar-KW', 'ar-LB', 'ar-LY', 'ar-MA', 'ar-QA', 'ar-QM', 'ar-SA', 'ar-SD', 'ar-SY', 'ar-TN', 'ar-YE', 'cs-CZ', 'de-DE', 'en-AU', 'en-GB', 'en-HK', 'en-IN', 'en-NZ', 'en-US', 'en-ZA', 'en-ZM', 'es-ES', 'fr-FR', 'hu-HU', 'nl-NL', 'pl-PL', 'pt-PT', 'ru-RU', 'tr-TR']) and defaults to en-US. isAscii(str) - check if the string contains ASCII chars only. isBase64(str) - check if a string is base64 encoded. isBefore(str [, date]) - check if the string is a date that's before the specified date. isBoolean(str) - check if a string is a boolean. isByteLength(str, options) - check if the string's length (in bytes) falls in a range.options is an object which defaults to {min:0, max: undefined}. isCreditCard(str) - check if the string is a credit card. isCurrency(str, options) - check if the string is a valid currency amount. options is an object which defaults to {symbol: '$', require_symbol: false, allow_space_after_symbol: false, symbol_after_digits: false, allow_negatives: true, parens_for_negatives: false, negative_sign_before_digits: false, negative_sign_after_digits: false, allow_negative_sign_placeholder: false, thousands_separator: ',', decimal_separator: '.', allow_space_after_digits: false }. isDataURI(str) - check if the string is a data uri format. isDate(str) - check if the string is a date. isDecimal(str) - check if the string represents a decimal number, such as 0.1, .3, 1.1, 1.00003, 4.0, etc. isDivisibleBy(str, number) - check if the string is a number that's divisible by another. isEmail(str [, options]) - check if the string is an email. options is an object which defaults to { allow_display_name: false, allow_utf8_local_part: true, require_tld: true }. If allow_display_name is set to true, the validator will also match Display Name <email-address>. If allow_utf8_local_part is set to false, the validator will not allow any non-English UTF8 character in email address' local part. If require_tld is set to false, e-mail addresses without having TLD in their domain will also be matched. isFQDN(str [, options]) - check if the string is a fully qualified domain name (e.g. domain.com). options is an object which defaults to { require_tld: true, allow_underscores: false, allow_trailing_dot: false }. isFloat(str [, options]) - check if the string is a float. options is an object which can contain the keys min and/or max to validate the float is within boundaries (e.g. { min: 7.22, max: 9.55 }). isFullWidth(str) - check if the string contains any full-width chars. isHalfWidth(str) - check if the string contains any half-width chars. isHexColor(str) - check if the string is a hexadecimal color. isHexadecimal(str) - check if the string is a hexadecimal number. isIP(str [, version]) - check if the string is an IP (version 4 or 6). isISBN(str [, version]) - check if the string is an ISBN (version 10 or 13). isISIN(str) - check if the string is an ISIN (stock/security identifier). isISO8601(str) - check if the string is a valid ISO 8601 date. isIn(str, values) - check if the string is in a array of allowed values. isInt(str [, options]) - check if the string is an integer. options is an object which can contain the keys min and/or max to check the integer is within boundaries (e.g. { min: 10, max: 99 }). options can also contain the key allow_leading_zeroes, which when set to true will accept integer values with leading zeroes (e.g. { allow_leading_zeroes: true }). isJSON(str) - check if the string is valid JSON (note: uses JSON.parse). isLength(str, options) - check if the string's length falls in a range. options is an object which defaults to {min:0, max: undefined}. Note: this function takes into account surrogate pairs. isLowercase(str) - check if the string is lowercase. isMACAddress(str) - check if the string is a MAC address. isMobilePhone(str, locale) - check if the string is a mobile phone number, (locale is one of ['ar-DZ', 'ar-SY', 'cs-CZ', 'de-DE', 'da-DK', 'el-GR', 'en-AU', 'en-GB', 'en-HK', 'en-IN', 'en-NZ', 'en-US', 'en-CA', 'en-ZA', 'en-ZM', 'es-ES', 'fi-FI', 'fr-FR', 'hu-HU', 'ms-MY', 'nb-NO', 'nn-NO', 'pl-PL', 'pt-PT', 'ru-RU', 'tr-TR', 'vi-VN', 'zh-CN', 'zh-TW']). isMongoId(str) - check if the string is a valid hex-encoded representation of a MongoDB ObjectId. isMultibyte(str) - check if the string contains one or more multibyte chars. isNull(str) - check if the string is null (has a length of zero). isNumeric(str) - check if the string contains only numbers. isSurrogatePair(str) - check if the string contains any surrogate pairs chars. isURL(str [, options]) - check if the string is an URL. options is an object which defaults to { protocols: ['http','https','ftp'], require_tld: true, require_protocol: false, require_valid_protocol: true, allow_underscores: false, host_whitelist: false, host_blacklist: false, allow_trailing_dot: false, allow_protocol_relative_urls: false }. isUUID(str [, version]) - check if the string is a UUID (version 3, 4 or 5). isUppercase(str) - check if the string is uppercase. isVariableWidth(str) - check if the string contains a mixture of full and half-width chars. isWhitelisted(str, chars) - checks characters if they appear in the whitelist. matches(str, pattern [, modifiers]) - check if string matches the pattern. Either matches('foo', /foo/i) or matches('foo', 'foo', 'i'). Sanitizers blacklist(input, chars) - remove characters that appear in the blacklist. The characters are used in a RegExp and so you will need to escape some chars, e.g. blacklist(input, '\\[\\]'). escape(input) - replace <, >, &, ', "" and / with HTML entities. unescape(input) - replaces HTML encoded entities with <, >, &, ', "" and /. ltrim(input [, chars]) - trim characters from the left-side of the input. normalizeEmail(email [, options]) - canonicalize an email address. options is an object which defaults to { lowercase: true, remove_dots: true, remove_extension: true }. With lowercase set to true, the local part of the email address is lowercased for all domains; the hostname is always lowercased and the local part of the email address is always lowercased for hosts that are known to be case-insensitive (currently only GMail). Normalization follows special rules for known providers: currently, GMail addresses have dots removed in the local part and are stripped of extensions (e.g. some.one+extension@gmail.com becomes someone@gmail.com) and all @googlemail.com addresses are normalized to @gmail.com. rtrim(input [, chars]) - trim characters from the right-side of the input. stripLow(input [, keep_new_lines]) - remove characters with a numerical value < 32 and 127, mostly control characters. If keep_new_lines is true, newline characters are preserved (\n and \r, hex 0xA and 0xD). Unicode-safe in JavaScript. toBoolean(input [, strict]) - convert the input string to a boolean. Everything except for '0', 'false' and '' returns true. In strict mode only '1' and 'true' return true. toDate(input) - convert the input string to a date, or null if the input is not a date. toFloat(input) - convert the input string to a float, or NaN if the input is not a float. toInt(input [, radix]) - convert the input string to an integer, or NaN if the input is not an integer. trim(input [, chars]) - trim characters (whitespace by default) from both sides of the input. whitelist(input, chars) - remove characters that do not appear in the whitelist. The characters are used in a RegExp and so you will need to escape some chars, e.g. whitelist(input, '\\[\\]'). XSS Sanitization XSS sanitization was removed from the library in 2d5d6999. For an alternative, have a look at Yahoo's xss-filters library or at DOMPurify. Tests $ npm test Reading Remember, validating can be troublesome sometimes.

It is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. It is around 2kb minified and gzipped and 4.5kb minified, has no external dependencies, and has been tested in the following browsers: Internet Explorer 6+ Safari Firefox Chrome It has support for keypress, keydown, and keyup events on specific keys, keyboard combinations, or key sequences. Getting started Include mousetrap on your page before the closing </body> tag <script src=""/path/to/mousetrap.min.js""></script> Add some keyboard events to listen for <script>     // single keys     Mousetrap.bind('4', function() { console.log('4'); });     Mousetrap.bind(""?"", function() { console.log('show shortcuts!'); });     Mousetrap.bind('esc', function() { console.log('escape'); }, 'keyup');      // combinations     Mousetrap.bind('command+shift+k', function() { console.log('command shift k'); });      // map multiple combinations to the same callback     Mousetrap.bind(['command+k', 'ctrl+k'], function() {         console.log('command k or control k');          // return false to prevent default browser behavior         // and stop event from bubbling         return false;     });      // gmail style sequences     Mousetrap.bind('g i', function() { console.log('go to inbox'); });     Mousetrap.bind('* a', function() { console.log('select all'); });      // konami code!     Mousetrap.bind('up up down down left right left right b a enter', function() {         console.log('konami code');     }); </script> Why Mousetrap? There are a number of other similar libraries out there so what makes this one different? There are no external dependencies, no framework is required You are not limited to keydown events (You can specify keypress, keydown, or keyup or let Mousetrap choose for you). You can bind key events directly to special keys such as ? or * without having to specify shift+/ or shift+8 which are not consistent across all keyboards It works with international keyboard layouts You can bind Gmail like key sequences in addition to regular keys and key combinations You can programatically trigger key events with the trigger() method It works with the numeric keypad on your keyboard The code is well documented/commented Tests Unit tests run via mocha. Running in browser View it online to check your browser compatibility. You may also download the repo and open tests/mousetrap.html in your browser. Running with Grunt and PhantomJS Install grunt-cli npm install -g grunt-cli Install npm packages cd /path/to/repo npm install Run tests grunt mocha Documentation Full documentation can be found at https://craig.is/killing/mice Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

It has no dependencies. It’s a work in progress (e.g. beta), so spare me your nerdrage and instead contribute! Patches are welcome, but they are not guaranteed to make it in. Usage Include keymaster.js in your web app*, by loading it as usual: <script src=""keymaster.js""></script> Keymaster has no dependencies and can be used completely standalone. It should not interfere with any JavaScript libraries or frameworks. *Preferably use a minified version that fits your workflow. You can run make to have UglifyJS (if you have it installed) create a keymaster.min.js file for you. Defining shortcuts One global method is exposed, key which defines shortcuts when called directly. // define short of 'a' key('a', function(){ alert('you pressed a!') });  // returning false stops the event and prevents default browser events key('ctrl+r', function(){ alert('stopped reload!'); return false });  // multiple shortcuts that do the same thing key('⌘+r, ctrl+r', function(){ }); The handler method is called with two arguments set, the keydown event fired, and an object containing, among others, the following two properties: shortcut: a string that contains the shortcut used, e.g. ctrl+r scope: a string describing the scope (or all) key('⌘+r, ctrl+r', function(event, handler){   console.log(handler.shortcut, handler.scope); });  // ""ctrl+r"", ""all"" Supported keys Keymaster understands the following modifiers: ⇧, shift, option, ⌥, alt, ctrl, control, command, and ⌘. The following special keys can be used for shortcuts: backspace, tab, clear, enter, return, esc, escape, space, up, down, left, right, home, end, pageup, pagedown, del, delete and f1 through f19. Modifier key queries At any point in time (even in code other than key shortcut handlers), you can query the key object for the state of any keys. This allows easy implementation of things like shift+click handlers. For example, key.shift is true if the shift key is currently pressed. if(key.shift) alert('shift is pressed, OMGZ!'); Other key queries At any point in time (even in code other than key shortcut handlers), you can query the key object for the state of any key. This is very helpful for game development using a game loop. For example, key.isPressed(77) is true if the M key is currently pressed. if(key.isPressed(""M"")) alert('M key is pressed, can ya believe it!?'); if(key.isPressed(77)) alert('M key is pressed, can ya believe it!?'); You can also get these as an array using... key.getPressedKeyCodes() // returns an array of key codes currently pressed Scopes If you want to reuse the same shortcut for separate areas in your single page app, Keymaster supports switching between scopes. Use the key.setScope method to set scope. // define shortcuts with a scope key('o, enter', 'issues', function(){ /* do something */ }); key('o, enter', 'files', function(){ /* do something else */ });  // set the scope (only 'all' and 'issues' shortcuts will be honored) key.setScope('issues'); // default scope is 'all'  // remove all events that are set in 'issues' scope key.deleteScope('issues');  Filter key presses By default, when an INPUT, SELECT or TEXTAREA element is focused, Keymaster doesn't process any shortcuts. You can change this by overwriting key.filter with a new function. This function is called before Keymaster processes shortcuts, with the keydown event as argument. If your function returns false, then the no shortcuts will be processed. Here's the default implementation for reference: function filter(event){   var tagName = (event.target || event.srcElement).tagName;   return !(tagName == 'INPUT' || tagName == 'SELECT' || tagName == 'TEXTAREA'); } If you only want some shortcuts to work while in an input element, you can change the scope in the key.filter function. Here's an example implementation, setting the scope to either 'input' or 'other'. Don't forget to return true so the any shortcuts get processed. key.filter = function(event){   var tagName = (event.target || event.srcElement).tagName;   key.setScope(/^(INPUT|TEXTAREA|SELECT)$/.test(tagName) ? 'input' : 'other');   return true; } However a more robust way to handle this is to use proper focus and blur event handlers on your input element, and change scopes there as you see fit. noConflict mode You can call key.noConflict to remove the key function from global scope and restore whatever key was defined to before Keymaster was loaded. Calling key.noConflict will return the Keymaster key function. var k = key.noConflict(); k('a', function() { /* ... */ });  key() // --> TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function Unbinding shortcuts Similar to defining shortcuts, they can be unbound using key.unbind. // unbind 'a' handler key.unbind('a');  // unbind a key only for a single scope // when no scope is specified it defaults to the current scope (key.getScope()) key.unbind('o, enter', 'issues'); key.unbind('o, enter', 'files'); Notes Keymaster should work with any browser that fires keyup and keydown events, and is tested with IE (6+), Safari, Firefox and Chrome. See http://madrobby.github.com/keymaster/ for a live demo. CoffeeScript If you're using CoffeeScript, configuring key shortcuts couldn't be simpler: key 'a', -> alert('you pressed a!')  key '⌘+r, ctrl+r', ->   alert 'stopped reload!'   off  key 'o, enter', 'issues', ->   whatevs()  alert 'shift is pressed, OMGZ!' if key.shift Contributing To contribute, please fork Keymaster, add your patch and tests for it (in the test/ folder) and submit a pull request.

Pull request #107 2.1.3 Just fixing the bower JSON. Thanks OleCordsen. Issue #101 2.1.2 Added some simple jQuery proofing so you can pass in the result of a jQuery selector into the Listener's constructor. Thanks to mallocator for the request. Issue #89 Changed the default behavior of how sequence combos behavior. Most people probably would have considered this a bug, so I'm not considering this API breaking. Thanks to ronnyek for pointing the problem out in Issue #68. Bower file cleaned up thanks to kkirsche. Pull request #97 Keys in FF/Gecko - and = fixed thanks to deanputney. Pull request #95 2.1.1 Added Meteor support. Thanks to dandv. Pull request #63 2.1.0 Another fix for unregistering combos using an array of keys Added a destroy method to cleanup a listener.

Thanks to sorrycc. Pull request #52 2.0.3 Fixed a bug unregistering combos using arrays of keys Added ie8 compatibility shim. Thanks to barrkel. Issue #41 Fixed a bug targetting the semicolon key in Firefox. Thanks to mikekuehn. Added commonJS module support. Issue #45 2.0.2 Fixed a bug that prevented combos from unregistering, and updated the docs for how to unregister properly. Thanks to pelly and g00fy-. Issue # 34. Added AMD support. Issue #37. 2.0.1 Fixed a big ole bug with meta/cmd combos. Thanks to lexey111. Issue #29. Fixed a bug with the Windows key being released on Windows systems. Issue #27. 2.0.0 Keypress now has a listener class that must be instantiated. The functions that were previously in the global window.keypress object are now public methods of the window.keypress.Listener class. Each instance of a Keypress listener can be bound to a DOM element by passing in the element to the listener's constructor. Combos now default to being ordered (the property is now called is_unordered and is false by default). Combos' handlers preventDefault unless the handler returns true. The ""combo"" public method is now called ""simple_combo"". The basic combo helpers for simple, counting and sequence combos no longer have a third prevent_default optional parameter. Debugging console logs can be enabled by setting keypress.debug to true. All key event callbacks send a third argument specifying whether the event is firing again automatically because the key has remained pressed down. 1.0.9 Fix escape key bug. Issue #17. Fix unregister bug. Issue #24. 1.0.8 Ensure that on_release is called for all combos, not just counting combos. Fix bug that was causing is_ordered to be ignored. Fixed an edge case for a counting combo's count not being reset. Improve how key events are bound 1.0.7 Fixed combo matching to prevent performance issues as more keys are pressed. 1.0.6 Fixed a bug with exclusive combos not properly excluding each other in some cases. Feature added to allow for combos that do not fire if unrelated keys are also pressed (""is_solitary"" boolean). TODO Put negative edge in sequences. See if we can do away with keyup_fired and count properties. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc. Terms Privacy Security Status Help Something went wrong with that request.

It Allows developers to easily setup key bindings. Use key combos to setup complex bindings. KeyboardJS also provides contexts. Contexts are great for single page applications. They allow you to scope your bindings to various parts of your application. Out of the box keyboardJS uses a US keyboard locale. If you need support for a different type of keyboard KeyboardJS provides custom locale support so you can create with a locale that better matches your needs. KeyboardJS is available as a NPM module for use with browserify (or in node.js). If you don't use browserify you can simply include keyboard.js or keyboard.min.js from the dist folder in this repo. These files are UMD wrapped so they can be used with or without a module loader such as requireJS. npm install keyboardjs Note that all key names can be found in ./locales/us.js. If you're looking for the previous v1.x.x release of KeyboardJS you can find it here. Setting up bindings is easy keyboardJS.bind('a', function(e) {   console.log('a is pressed'); }); keyboardJS.bind('a + b', function(e) {   console.log('a and b is pressed'); }); keyboardJS.bind('a + b > c', function(e) {   console.log('a and b then c is pressed'); }); keyboardJS.bind(['a + b > c', 'z + y > z'], function(e) {   console.log('a and b then c or z and y then z is pressed'); });  // keyboardJS.bind === keyboardJS.on === keyboardJS.addListener keydown vs a keyup keyboardJS.bind('a', function(e) {   console.log('a is pressed'); }, function(e) {   console.log('a is released'); }); keyboardJS.bind('a', null, function(e) {   console.log('a is released'); }); Prevent keydown repeat keyboardJS.bind('a', function(e) {   // this function will once run once even if a is held   e.preventRepeat();   console.log('a is pressed'); }); Unbind things keyboardJS.unbind('a', previouslyBoundHandler); // keyboardJS.unbind === keyboardJS.off === keyboardJS.removeListener Using contexts   // these will execute in all contexts   keyboardJS.bind('a', function(e) {});   keyboardJS.bind('b', function(e) {});   keyboardJS.bind('c', function(e) {});    // these will execute in the index context   keyboardJS.setContext('index');   keyboardJS.bind('1', function(e) {});   keyboardJS.bind('2', function(e) {});   keyboardJS.bind('3', function(e) {});    // these will execute in the foo context   keyboardJS.setContext('foo');   keyboardJS.bind('x', function(e) {});   keyboardJS.bind('y', function(e) {});   keyboardJS.bind('z', function(e) {});    // if we have a router we can activate these contexts when appropriate   myRouter.on('GET /', function(e) {     keyboardJS.setContext('index');   });   myRouter.on('GET /foo', function(e) {     keyboardJS.setContext('foo');   });    // you can always figure out your context too   var contextName = keyboardJS.getContext();    // you can also set up handlers for a context without losing the current context   keyboardJS.withContext('bar', function() {     // these will execute in the bar context     keyboardJS.bind('7', function(e) {});     keyboardJS.bind('8', function(e) {});     keyboardJS.bind('9', function(e) {});   }); pause, resume, and reset // the keyboard will no longer trigger bindings keyboardJS.pause();  // the keyboard will once again trigger bindings keyboardJS.resume();  // all active bindings will released and unbound, // pressed keys will be cleared keyboardJS.reset(); pressKey, releaseKey, and releaseAllKeys // pressKey keyboardJS.pressKey('a'); // or keyboardJS.pressKey(65);  // releaseKey keyboardJS.releaseKey('a'); // or keyboardJS.releaseKey(65);  // releaseAllKeys keyboardJS.releaseAllKeys(); watch and stop // bind to the window and document in the current window keyboardJS.watch();  // or pass your own window and document keyboardJS.watch(myDoc); keyboardJS.watch(myWin, myDoc);  // or scope to a specific element keyboardJS.watch(myForm); keyboardJS.watch(myWin, myForm);  // detach KeyboardJS from the window and document/element keyboardJS.stop(); Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Feb 22, 2010 README.md jQuery.Hotkeys About jQuery Hotkeys is a plug-in that lets you easily add and remove handlers for keyboard events anywhere in your code supporting almost any key combination. This plugin is based off of the plugin by Tzury Bar Yochay: jQuery.hotkeys The syntax is as follows: $(expression).bind(types, keys, handler); $(expression).unbind(types, handler);  $(document).bind('keydown', 'ctrl+a', fn);  // e.g. replace '$' sign with 'EUR' $('input.foo').bind('keyup', '$', function(){   this.value = this.value.replace('$', 'EUR'); }); Syntax when wanting to use jQuery's on()/off methods: $(expression).on(types, null, keys, handler); $(expression).off(types, handler);  $(document).on('keydown', null, 'ctrl+a', fn);  // e.g. replace '$' sign with 'EUR' $('input.foo').on('keyup', null, '$', function(){   this.value = this.value.replace('$', 'EUR'); });     Example Example Event Types Supported types are 'keydown', 'keyup' and 'keypress' jQuery Compatibility Works with jQuery 1.4.2 and newer. It is known to be working with all the major browsers on all available platforms (Win/Mac/Linux) IE 6/7/8+ FF 1.5/2/3+ Opera-9+ Safari-3+ Chrome-0.2+ Browserify Compatibility If you want to include this module in a Browserified project, just add it to node_modules and require it. require('jquery.javascript'); This will work if jQuery is global (ex. served from a CDN). If it's not, you need to shim it: {   ""browserify-shim"": {     ""jquery"": ""global:jQuery""   } } Notes Modifiers are not case sensitive (Ctrl == ctrl == cTRL) If you want to use more than one modifier (e.g. alt+ctrl+z) you should define them by an alphabetical order e.g. alt+ctrl+shift Hotkeys aren't tracked if you're inside of an input element (unless you explicitly bind the hotkey directly to the input). This helps to avoid conflict with normal user typing. You can use namespacing by adding a suffix to the event type (e.g. keyup.toggle) Hotkeys within inputs Hotkeys aren't tracked if the user is focused within an input element or any element that has contenteditable=""true"" unless you bind the hotkey directly to the element. This helps to avoid conflict with normal user typing. If you don't want this, you can change the booleans of the following to suit: jQuery.hotkeys.options.filterInputAcceptingElements jQuery.hotkeys.options.filterContentEditable jQuery.hotkeys.options.filterTextInputs (deprecated, will be removed in a later version) Meta and Hyper Keys Meta and hyper keys don't register on keyup in any browser tested. Chrome 33.0.1750.117 Meta key registers on keydown event. Hyper key registers on keydown event. Firefox 27.0.1 and Safari 7.0.1 Meta key registers on keydown and keypress events. Hyper key registers on keydown and keypress events. Opera 19.0 Meta key doesn't register at all :( Hyper key registers on keydown and keypress events. TL;DR Bind to keydown event for meta and hyper keys, but meta key does not work in Opera ;) Addendum Firefox is the most liberal one in the manner of letting you capture all short-cuts even those that are built-in in the browser such as Ctrl-t for new tab, or Ctrl-a for selecting all text. You can always bubble them up to the browser by returning true in your handler. Others, (IE) either let you handle built-in short-cuts, but will add their functionality after your code has executed. Or (Opera/Safari) will not pass those events to the DOM at all. So, if you bind Ctrl-Q or Alt-F4 and your Safari/Opera window is closed don't be surprised.

It normalises the poor std api into something easy to use and clear. jwerty is a small library, weighing in at around 1.5kb bytes minified and gzipped (~3kb minified). jwerty has no dependencies, but is compatible with jQuery, Zepto, Ender or CanJS if you include those packages alongside it. You can install jwerty via npm (for use with Ender) or Bower. For detailed docs, please read the README-DETAILED.md file. The Short version Use jwerty.key to bind your callback to a key combo (global shortcuts) jwerty.key('ctrl+shift+P', function () { [...] }); jwerty.key('⌃+⇧+P', function () { [...] }); Specify optional keys: jwerty.key('⌃+⇧+P/⌘+⇧+P', function () { [...] }); or key sequences: jwerty.key('↑,↑,↓,↓,←,→,←,→,B,A,↩', function () { [...] }); You can also (since 0.3) specify regex-like ranges: jwerty.key('ctrl+[a-c]', function () { [...] }); // fires for ctrl+a,ctrl+b or ctrl+c Pass in a context to bind your callback: jwerty.key('⌃+⇧+P/⌘+⇧+P', function () { [...] }, this); Pass in a selector to bind a shortcut local to that element: jwerty.key('⌃+⇧+P/⌘+⇧+P', function () { [...] }, this, '#myinput'); Pass in a selector's context, similar to jQuery's $('selector', 'scope'): jwerty.key('⌃+⇧+P/⌘+⇧+P', function () { [...] }, this, 'input.email', '#myForm'); If you're binding to a selector and don't need the context, you can ommit it: jwerty.key('⌃+⇧+P/⌘+⇧+P', function () { [...] }, 'input.email', '#myForm'); Calls to jwerty.key return a subscription handle that you can use to disconnect the callback var h = jwerty.key('ctrl+shift+P', function () { [...] }) h.unbind() Use jwerty.event as a decorator, to bind events your own way: $('#myinput').bind('keydown', jwerty.event('⌃+⇧+P/⌘+⇧+P', function () { [...] })); Use jwerty.is to check a keyCombo against a keyboard event: function (event) {     if ( jwerty.is('⌃+⇧+P', event) ) {         [...]     } } Or use jwerty.fire to send keyboard events to other places: jwerty.fire('enter', 'input:first-child', '#myForm'); Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Each notification is added to a queue. (Optional) The notifications can be positioned at the; top - topLeft - topCenter - topRight - center - centerLeft - centerRight - bottom - bottomLeft - bottomCenter - bottomRight There are lots of other options in the API to customise the text, animation, speed, buttons and much more. It also has various callbacks for the buttons, opening closing the notifications and queue control.

Dec 20, 2015 testing.html Fixes for Browserify and RequireJS. Added tests. Nov 21, 2015 README.md PNotify is a JavaScript notification plugin, developed by SciActive. PNotify can also provide desktop notifications based on the Web Notifications spec. If desktop notifications are not available or not allowed, PNotify will fall back to displaying the notice as a regular, in-browser notice. Demos http://sciactive.com/pnotify/ Requirements jQuery (1.6 or higher) Getting Started You can include PNotify using Bower, NPM, or a custom download. PNotify custom download comes with the following files: pnotify.custom.js & pnotify.custom.min.js (Minified) pnotify.custom.css & pnotify.custom.min.css (Minified) So here's how you'd include them on your page: <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""pnotify.custom.min.js""></script> <link href=""pnotify.custom.min.css"" media=""all"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" /> Now you can use PNotify like this: <script type=""text/javascript"">     $(function(){         new PNotify({             title: 'Regular Notice',             text: 'Check me out! I\'m a notice.'         });     }); </script> If you are not using any UI library, you can use the included styling, called Bright Theme. It is the default. If you are using Bootstrap version 2, include this line somewhere before your first notice: PNotify.prototype.options.styling = ""bootstrap2""; If you are using Bootstrap version 3, include this line somewhere before your first notice: PNotify.prototype.options.styling = ""bootstrap3""; If you are using jQuery UI, include this line somewhere before your first notice: PNotify.prototype.options.styling = ""jqueryui""; If you are using Bootstrap 3 with Font Awesome, include this line somewhere before your first notice: PNotify.prototype.options.styling = ""fontawesome""; Stacks A stack is an object which PNotify uses to determine where to position notices. A stack has two mandatory properties, dir1 and dir2. dir1 is the first direction in which the notices are stacked. When the notices run out of room in the window, they will move over in the direction specified by dir2. The directions can be ""up"", ""down"", ""right"", or ""left"". Stacks are independent of each other, so a stack doesn't know and doesn't care if it overlaps (and blocks) another stack. The default stack, which can be changed like any other default, goes down, then left. Stack objects are used and manipulated by PNotify, and therefore, should be a variable when passed. So, calling something like new PNotify({stack: {""dir1"": ""down"", ""dir2"": ""left""}}); will NOT work. It will create a notice, but that notice will be in its own stack and may overlap other notices. Modal Stacks You can set a stack as modal by setting the ""modal"" property to true. A modal stack creates an overlay behind it when any of its notices are open. When the last notice within it is removed, the overlay is hidden. If the ""overlay_close"" property is set to true, then clicking the overlay will cause all of the notices in that stack to be removed. Example Stacks var stack_topleft = {""dir1"": ""down"", ""dir2"": ""right"", ""push"": ""top""}; var stack_bottomleft = {""dir1"": ""right"", ""dir2"": ""up"", ""push"": ""top""}; var stack_modal = {""dir1"": ""down"", ""dir2"": ""right"", ""push"": ""top"", ""modal"": true, ""overlay_close"": true}; var stack_bar_top = {""dir1"": ""down"", ""dir2"": ""right"", ""push"": ""top"", ""spacing1"": 0, ""spacing2"": 0}; var stack_bar_bottom = {""dir1"": ""up"", ""dir2"": ""right"", ""spacing1"": 0, ""spacing2"": 0}; var stack_context = {""dir1"": ""down"", ""dir2"": ""left"", ""context"": $(""#stack-context"")}; This stack is initially positioned through code instead of CSS. var stack_bottomright = {""dir1"": ""up"", ""dir2"": ""left"", ""firstpos1"": 25, ""firstpos2"": 25}; This is done through two extra variables. firstpos1 and firstpos2 are pixel values, relative to a viewport edge. dir1 and dir2, respectively, determine which edge. It is calculated as follows: dir = ""up"" - firstpos is relative to the bottom of viewport. dir = ""down"" - firstpos is relative to the top of viewport. dir = ""right"" - firstpos is relative to the left of viewport. dir = ""left"" - firstpos is relative to the right of viewport. To create a stack in the top left, define the stack: var stack_topleft = {""dir1"": ""down"", ""dir2"": ""right""}; and then add two options to your pnotify call: addclass: ""stack-topleft"", // This is one of the included default classes. stack: stack_topleft  There are several CSS classes included which will position your notices for you: stack-topleft stack-bottomleft stack-bottomright stack-modal You can create your own custom position and movement by defining a custom stack. Configuration Defaults / Options title: false - The notice's title. title_escape: false - Whether to escape the content of the title. (Not allow HTML.) text: false - The notice's text. text_escape: false - Whether to escape the content of the text. (Not allow HTML.) styling: ""brighttheme"" - What styling classes to use. (Can be either ""brighttheme"", ""jqueryui"", ""bootstrap2"", ""bootstrap3"", ""fontawesome"", or a custom style object. See the source in the end of pnotify.js for the properties in a style object.) addclass: """" - Additional classes to be added to the notice. (For custom styling.) cornerclass: """" - Class to be added to the notice for corner styling. auto_display: true - Display the notice when it is created. Turn this off to add notifications to the history without displaying them. width: ""300px"" - Width of the notice. min_height: ""16px"" - Minimum height of the notice. It will expand to fit content. type: ""notice"" - Type of the notice. ""notice"", ""info"", ""success"", or ""error"". icon: true - Set icon to true to use the default icon for the selected style/type, false for no icon, or a string for your own icon class. animation: ""fade"" - The animation to use when displaying and hiding the notice. ""none"", ""show"", ""fade"", and ""slide"" are built in to jQuery. Others require jQuery UI. Use an object with effect_in and effect_out to use different effects. animate_speed: ""slow"" - Speed at which the notice animates in and out. ""slow"", ""def"" or ""normal"", ""fast"" or number of milliseconds. position_animate_speed: 500 - Specify a specific duration of position animation. opacity: 1 - Opacity of the notice. shadow: true - Display a drop shadow. hide: true - After a delay, remove the notice. delay: 8000 - Delay in milliseconds before the notice is removed. mouse_reset: true - Reset the hide timer if the mouse moves over the notice. remove: true - Remove the notice's elements from the DOM after it is removed. insert_brs: true - Change new lines to br tags. stack: {""dir1"": ""down"", ""dir2"": ""left"", ""push"": ""bottom"", ""spacing1"": 25, ""spacing2"": 25, ""context"": $(""body""), ""modal"": false} - The stack on which the notices will be placed. Also controls the direction the notices stack. Desktop Module desktop: { desktop: false - Display the notification as a desktop notification. fallback: true - If desktop notifications are not supported or allowed, fall back to a regular notice. icon: null - The URL of the icon to display. If false, no icon will show. If null, a default icon will show. tag: null - Using a tag lets you update an existing notice, or keep from duplicating notices between tabs. If you leave tag null, one will be generated, facilitating the ""update"" function. text: null - Optionally display different text for the desktop } Buttons Module buttons: { closer: true - Provide a button for the user to manually close the notice. closer_hover: true - Only show the closer button on hover. sticker: true - Provide a button for the user to manually stick the notice. sticker_hover: true - Only show the sticker button on hover. show_on_nonblock: false - Show the buttons even when the nonblock module is in use. labels: {close: ""Close"", stick: ""Stick""} - Lets you change the displayed text, facilitating internationalization. classes: {closer: null, pin_up: null, pin_down: null} - The classes to use for button icons. Leave them null to use the classes from the styling you're using. } NonBlock Module nonblock: { nonblock: false - Create a non-blocking notice. It lets the user click elements underneath it. nonblock_opacity: .2 - The opacity of the notice (if it's non-blocking) when the mouse is over it. } Mobile Module mobile: { swipe_dismiss: true - Let the user swipe the notice away. styling: true - Styles the notice to look good on mobile. } Animate Module animate: { animate: false - Use animate.css to animate the notice. in_class: """" - The class to use to animate the notice in. out_class: """" - The class to use to animate the notice out. } The Animate module also creates a method, attention, on notices which accepts an attention grabber class from Animate.css and callback to be called on completion of the animation. Confirm Module confirm: { confirm: false - Make a confirmation box. prompt: false - Make a prompt. prompt_class: """" - Classes to add to the input element of the prompt. prompt_default: """" - The default value of the prompt. prompt_multi_line: false - Whether the prompt should accept multiple lines of text. align: ""right"" - Where to align the buttons. (right, center, left, justify) buttons: [{text: ""Ok"", addClass: """", promptTrigger: true, click: function(notice, value){ notice.remove(); notice.get().trigger(""pnotify.confirm"", [notice, value]); }},{text: ""Cancel"", addClass: """", click: function(notice){ notice.remove(); notice.get().trigger(""pnotify.cancel"", notice); }}] - The buttons to display, and their callbacks. If a button has promptTrigger set to true, it will be triggered when the user hits enter in a single line prompt. If you want only one button, use null as the second entry of your array to remove the cancel button. } History Module history: { history: true - Place the notice in the history. menu: false - Display a pull down menu to redisplay previous notices. fixed: true - Make the pull down menu fixed to the top of the viewport. maxonscreen: Infinity - Maximum number of notifications to have onscreen. labels: {redisplay: ""Redisplay"", all: ""All"", last: ""Last""} - Lets you change the displayed text, facilitating internationalization. } Reference Module reference: { putThing: false - Provide a thing for stuff. Turned off by default. labels: {text: ""Spin Around""} - If you are displaying any text, you should use a labels options to support internationalization. } Callbacks Module The callback options all expect one argument, a function, which will be called when that event occurs. They can be included in the options object passed to PNotify() just like the core options. If the function returns false on the ""before_open"" or ""before_close"" callback, that event will be canceled. before_init - This option is called before the notice has been initialized. It accepts one argument, the options object. after_init - This option is called after the notice has been initialized. It accepts one argument, the notice object. before_open - This option is called before the notice has been displayed. It accepts one argument, the notice object. after_open - This option is called after the notice has been displayed. It accepts one argument, the notice object. before_close - This option is called before the notice closes. It accepts one argument, the notice object. after_close - This option is called after the notice closes. It accepts one argument, the notice object. Utility Functions PNotify.reload(root) - Reinitialize PNotify. PNotify, in a browser, is initialized with window as the root. Returns the created PNotify object. PNotify.removeAll() - Remove all notices. PNotify.removeStack(stack) - Remove all the notices in a stack. PNotify.positionAll(animate) - Reposition the notices, optionally animating their movement. notice.open() - Open the notice. notice.remove() - Remove the notice. notice.get() - Get the notice's DOM element. Using PNotify with RequireJS When they detect AMD/RequireJS, PNotify core defines the named module ""pnotify"", and PNotify's modules each define names like ""pnotify.module"". The following example shows the use of the nonblock and desktop modules with RequireJS. requirejs(['pnotify', 'pnotify.nonblock', 'pnotify.desktop'], function(PNotify){     PNotify.desktop.permission();     new PNotify({         title: 'Desktop Notice',         text: 'If you\'ve given me permission, I\'ll appear as a desktop notification. If you haven\'t, I\'ll still appear as a regular PNotify notice.',         desktop: {             desktop: true         },         nonblock: {             nonblock: true         }     }); }); Licensing and Additional Info PNotify is distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

These default to fadeIn/fadeOut. The methods fadeIn/fadeOut, slideDown/slideUp, and show/hide are built into jQuery. toastr.options.showMethod = 'slideDown'; toastr.options.hideMethod = 'slideUp'; toastr.options.closeMethod = 'slideUp'; Prevent Duplicates Rather than having identical toasts stack, set the preventDuplicates property to true. Duplicates are matched to the previous toast based on their message content. toastr.options.preventDuplicates = true; Timeouts Control how toastr interacts with users by setting timeouts appropriately. Timeouts can be disabled by setting them to 0. toastr.options.timeOut = 30; // How long the toast will display without user interaction toastr.options.extendedTimeOut = 60; // How long the toast will display after a user hovers over it Progress Bar Visually indicate how long before a toast expires. toastr.options.progressBar = true; Building Toastr To build the minified and css versions of Toastr you will need node installed. (Use Homebrew or Chocolatey.) npm install -g gulp karma-cli npm install  At this point the dependencies have been installed and you can build Toastr Run the analytics gulp analyze Run the test gulp test Run the build gulp Contributing For a pull request to be considered it must resolve a bug, or add a feature which is beneficial to a large audience.

I really liked the project but I wanted to remove the jQuery dependency, add support for CSS transitions, and have more control over the timing. About humane.js tries to be as unobtrusive as possible to the user experience while providing helpful information that is clear and grabs the users attention. It is framework independent. Customizable. Setup Setup is simple: Download tar/zip Select a theme from themes dir. Include the theme CSS in your page Include humane.min.js in your page Demo/Usage You can see a demo and usage here Custom Themes Got a neat theme/animation, love to see it. View theme-src/bigbox.styl for an template to get started (uses Stylus w/ Nib and Canvas). To get setup with Stylus use npm: npm install --development With Stylus installed you can watch for changes and compile into CSS by running: npm run watch Desktop and Mobile Browser Support humane.js has been tested for the following browsers. Internet Explorer 7+ Firefox 3+ Chrome 9+ Safari 3+ Opera 10+ iOS 4+ Android 2+ AMD and Node.js Support humane.js works for AMD systems like require.js and within Node.js CommonJS module system like browserify.

This alert system uses css animations and background (so there are no images or js animation code...so it's really lightweight). It's trivial to implement and really easy to change the style. Take a look at the demo: http://smoke-js.com/ Also, we've made some cool themes for you: http://github.com/hxgf/smoke-themes/ New in 0.1.3 AMD module new .quiz() method updated (and v v smooth) default style moved themes to http://github.com/hxgf/smoke-themes/ cleaned up the repo so it's just the css/js files (all demos/docs: http://smoke-js.com/) consistent callbacks/options order for .alert() Supported Browsers Chrome Firefox Safari IE 6+ (usable, no animation [who cares], visual IE6 support [transparencies, etc] is up to you) iOS Mobile Safari (widespread mobile support [android, blackberry, windows] uncertain (I mean, it probably works, but I can't really say that)) Current User Notices If you're using custom themes, you might want to check yourself. The markup/structure hasn't changed, but the base styles are different from the way they've always been, so just think about that for a while. .alert()'s callback/function order is changed to be consistent with the other methods. http://smoke-js.com/ for the correct order. Bugs/Contributing If you find a bug or have a cool idea for a feature, fork this repo and add a pull request. Your changes will probably get added as long as they're legit. If you've made any cool themes, add them to http://github.com/hxgf/smoke-themes/ Planned Updates Stop all the click/esc/enter listeners once a dialog is closed. Helpful code comments.

Getting Started Getting Started Guide API Demos Forum Dist / Build On production use files (JS and CSS) only from dist/ folder, there will be the most stable versions, build/ folder is only for development purpose Build Swiper uses gulp to build a development (build) and dist versions. First you need to have gulp-cli which you should install globally. $ npm install --global gulp  Then install all dependencies, in repo's root: $ npm install  And build development version of Swiper: $ gulp build  The result is available in build/ folder. Dist/Release After you have made build: $ gulp dist  Distributable version will available in dist/ folder. Contributing All changes should be committed to src/ files. Swiper uses LESS for CSS compliations, and concatenated JS files (look at gulpfile.js for concat files order) Swiper 2.x.x If you still using Swiper 2.x.x or you need old browsers support, you may find it in Swiper2 Branch Download Latest Swiper 2.7.6 Source Files API Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Data Attribute Settings In slick 1.5 you can now add settings using the data-slick attribute. You still need to call $(element).slick() to initialize slick on the element. Example: <div data-slick='{""slidesToShow"": 4, ""slidesToScroll"": 4}'>   <div><h3>1</h3></div>   <div><h3>2</h3></div>   <div><h3>3</h3></div>   <div><h3>4</h3></div>   <div><h3>5</h3></div>   <div><h3>6</h3></div> </div> Settings Option Type Default Description accessibility boolean true Enables tabbing and arrow key navigation adaptiveHeight boolean false Adapts slider height to the current slide autoplay boolean false Enables auto play of slides autoplaySpeed int 3000 Auto play change interval centerMode boolean false Enables centered view with partial prev/next slides. Use with odd numbered slidesToShow counts. centerPadding string '50px' Side padding when in center mode. (px or %) cssEase string 'ease' CSS3 easing customPaging function n/a Custom paging templates. See source for use example. dots boolean false Current slide indicator dots dotsClass string 'slick-dots' Class for slide indicator dots container draggable boolean true Enables desktop dragging easing string 'linear' animate() fallback easing edgeFriction integer 0.15 Resistance when swiping edges of non-infinite carousels fade boolean false Enables fade arrows boolean true Enable Next/Prev arrows appendArrows string $(element) Change where the navigation arrows are attached (Selector, htmlString, Array, Element, jQuery object) appendDots string $(element) Change where the navigation dots are attached (Selector, htmlString, Array, Element, jQuery object) mobileFirst boolean false Responsive settings use mobile first calculation prevArrow string (html | jQuery selector) | object (DOM node | jQuery object) <button type=""button"" class=""slick-prev"">Previous</button> Allows you to select a node or customize the HTML for the ""Previous"" arrow. nextArrow string (html | jQuery selector) | object (DOM node | jQuery object) <button type=""button"" class=""slick-next"">Next</button> Allows you to select a node or customize the HTML for the ""Next"" arrow. infinite boolean true Infinite looping initialSlide integer 0 Slide to start on lazyLoad string 'ondemand' Accepts 'ondemand' or 'progressive' for lazy load technique. 'ondemand' will load the image as soon as you slide to it, 'progressive' loads one image after the other when the page loads. pauseOnFocus boolean true Pauses autoplay when slider is focussed pauseOnHover boolean true Pauses autoplay on hover pauseOnDotsHover boolean false Pauses autoplay when a dot is hovered respondTo string 'window' Width that responsive object responds to. Can be 'window', 'slider' or 'min' (the smaller of the two). responsive array null Array of objects containing breakpoints and settings objects (see example). Enables settings at given breakpoint. Set settings to ""unslick"" instead of an object to disable slick at a given breakpoint. rows int 1 Setting this to more than 1 initializes grid mode. Use slidesPerRow to set how many slides should be in each row. slide string '' Slide element query slidesPerRow int 1 With grid mode initialized via the rows option, this sets how many slides are in each grid row. slidesToShow int 1 # of slides to show at a time slidesToScroll int 1 # of slides to scroll at a time speed int 300 Transition speed swipe boolean true Enables touch swipe swipeToSlide boolean false Swipe to slide irrespective of slidesToScroll touchMove boolean true Enables slide moving with touch touchThreshold int 5 To advance slides, the user must swipe a length of (1/touchThreshold) * the width of the slider. useCSS boolean true Enable/Disable CSS Transitions useTransform boolean true Enable/Disable CSS Transforms variableWidth boolean false Disables automatic slide width calculation vertical boolean false Vertical slide direction verticalSwiping boolean false Changes swipe direction to vertical rtl boolean false Change the slider's direction to become right-to-left waitForAnimate boolean true Ignores requests to advance the slide while animating zIndex number 1000 Set the zIndex values for slides, useful for IE9 and lower Responsive Option Example The responsive option, and value, is quite unique and powerful. You can use it like so: $("".slider"").slick({    // normal options...   infinite: false,    // the magic   responsive: [{        breakpoint: 1024,       settings: {         slidesToShow: 3,         infinite: true       }      }, {        breakpoint: 600,       settings: {         slidesToShow: 2,         dots: true       }      }, {        breakpoint: 300,       settings: ""unslick"" // destroys slick      }] }); Events In slick 1.4, callback methods were deprecated and replaced with events. Use them before the initialization of slick as shown below: // On swipe event $('.your-element').on('swipe', function(event, slick, direction){   console.log(direction);   // left });  // On edge hit $('.your-element').on('edge', function(event, slick, direction){   console.log('edge was hit') });  // On before slide change $('.your-element').on('beforeChange', function(event, slick, currentSlide, nextSlide){   console.log(nextSlide); }); Event Params Description afterChange event, slick, currentSlide After slide change callback beforeChange event, slick, currentSlide, nextSlide Before slide change callback breakpoint event, slick, breakpoint Fires after a breakpoint is hit destroy event, slick When slider is destroyed, or unslicked. edge event, slick, direction Fires when an edge is overscrolled in non-infinite mode. init event, slick When Slick initializes for the first time callback. Note that this event should be defined before initializing the slider. reInit event, slick Every time Slick (re-)initializes callback setPosition event, slick Every time Slick recalculates position swipe event, slick, direction Fires after swipe/drag lazyLoaded event, slick, image, imageSource Fires after image loads lazily lazyLoadError event, slick, image, imageSource Fires after image fails to load Methods Methods are called on slick instances through the slick method itself in version 1.4, see below: // Add a slide $('.your-element').slick('slickAdd',""<div></div>"");  // Get the current slide var currentSlide = $('.your-element').slick('slickCurrentSlide'); This new syntax allows you to call any internal slick method as well: // Manually refresh positioning of slick $('.your-element').slick('setPosition'); Method Argument Description slick options : object Initializes Slick unslick Destroys Slick slickNext Triggers next slide slickPrev Triggers previous slide slickPause Pause Autoplay slickPlay Start Autoplay (will also set autoplay option to true) slickGoTo index : int, dontAnimate : bool Goes to slide by index, skipping animation if second parameter is set to true slickCurrentSlide Returns the current slide index slickAdd element : html or DOM object, index: int, addBefore: bool Add a slide. If an index is provided, will add at that index, or before if addBefore is set. If no index is provided, add to the end or to the beginning if addBefore is set. Accepts HTML String slickRemove index: int, removeBefore: bool Remove slide by index. If removeBefore is set true, remove slide preceding index, or the first slide if no index is specified. If removeBefore is set to false, remove the slide following index, or the last slide if no index is set. slickFilter filter : selector or function Filters slides using jQuery .filter syntax slickUnfilter Removes applied filter slickGetOption option : string(option name) Gets an option value. slickSetOption change an option, refresh is always boolean and will update UI changes... option, value, refresh change a single option to given value; refresh is optional. ""responsive"", [{ breakpoint: n, settings: {} }, ... ], refresh change or add whole sets of responsive options { option: value, option: value, ... }, refresh change multiple options to corresponding values. Example Initialize with: $(element).slick({   dots: true,   speed: 500 }); Change the speed with: $(element).slick('slickSetOption', 'speed', 5000, true); Destroy with: $(element).slick('unslick'); Sass Variables Variable Type Default Description $slick-font-path string ""./fonts/"" Directory path for the slick icon font $slick-font-family string ""slick"" Font-family for slick icon font $slick-loader-path string ""./"" Directory path for the loader image $slick-arrow-color color white Color of the left/right arrow icons $slick-dot-color color black Color of the navigation dots $slick-dot-color-active color $slick-dot-color Color of the active navigation dot $slick-prev-character string '\2190' Unicode character code for the previous arrow icon $slick-next-character string '\2192' Unicode character code for the next arrow icon $slick-dot-character string '\2022' Unicode character code for the navigation dot icon $slick-dot-size pixels 6px Size of the navigation dots Browser support Slick works on IE8+ in addition to other modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

Many requests are resolved by other SlidesJS users, but assistance is not guaranteed. Faq Are there any other effects besides slide or fade? To keep SlidesJS as simple as possible, it only includes a slide or fade effect. Adding other effects would over complicate and bloat the plugin. Can I use SlidesJS on a commercial site or include it in a template that I'm selling? Yes you can, but you must keep the copyright and licensing information with the plugin. And if you've found SlidesJS useful, it would be awesome if you'd show your support by giving a donation. If you have additional questions about licensing check out the Apache license which SlidesJS is licensed under. I can't figure out how to add SlidesJS to my site. Can you help me? SlidesJS requires some basic understanding of HTML, CSS and jQuery. If you need help with adding SlidesJS to your site please post a question at the SlidesJS forum. Can I uses SlidesJS on my website? Yes you can, that's what it's for, but you must keep the copyright and licensing information with the plugin. Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Facebook Pin It!

Please view the Releases section for a list of official FlexSlider builds. Contributing We encourage contributions to FlexSlider and will review all pull requests submitted. Before contributing, please see our Contributing Guide. Roadmap To keep up to date with how FlexSlider's development roadmap looks, please see our development roadmap. Updates ** Version 2.6.1 ** ** SmoothHeight now uses innerHeight() instead of height() to account for padding in calculation . Defining var altText to prevent error. bower.json add fonts folder on main field. Changed true to false in order to make sure whether or not to allow a slider comprised of a single slide ** ** Version 2.6.0 ** ** Adds composer json file, scope fix for focused keyword, fixes bower demo folder exclusion, z-index fix for disabled nav arrow, play/pause accessibility fix, itemMargin fix for slider items, fixes accessibility for in focus elements and pagination controls, firefox fix for text selection on slider carousel, adds data-thumb-alt image alt attribute ** ** Version 2.5.0 ** ** Bumped compatibility support starting with jQuery 1.7+. pausePlay icon fix. Firefox touch event fix. Adds customDirectionNav param ** ** Version 2.4.0 ** ** Update for improved standards. Adds classes to li nav elements. Reset for li elements in stylesheet. ** ** Version 2.3.0 ** ** Fixes pauseInvisible attribute issue with Chrome and the Page Visibility API. ** ** Version 2.2.2 ** ** Fixes minified JavaScript file to remove merge conflicts. ** ** Version 2.2.0 ** Fixed event handler conflicts with devices that are both click and touch enabled. e.g., Windows 8. Made all slider variables public, stored in slider.vars. This allows manipulation of slider.vars.minItems and slider.vars.maxItems on the fly to create different fluid grids at certain breakpoints. Check out this example demonstrating a basic technique Fixed calculations that were causing strange issues with paging and certain FlexSliders to move out of alignment. Be sure to test v2.2.0 with your current slider, before pushing live, to ensure everything is playing nicely. General Notes FlexSlider is no longer licensed under the MIT license. FlexSlider now uses the license, GPLv2 and later. In an effort to move the plugin forward, support for jQuery 1.4.2 has been dropped. The plugin now requires jQuery 1.7.0+. If you don't have access to the later versions of jQuery, FlexSlider 1.8 should be a perfectly suitable substitute for your needs! Your old styles and properties might not work out of the box. Some property names have been changed, noted below, as well as namespacing prefixes being applied to all elements. This means that .flex-direction-nav .next is now .flex-direction-nav .flex-next by default. The namespacing property is exposed, free for you to change. No more overflow hidden woes! The plugin now generates a viewport element to handle the tedious task of working around overflow hidden. Yay! The slider element is now accessible outside of the callback API via the jQuery .data() method. Example use: $('#slider').data('flexslider') Helper strings have been added for performing actions quickly on FlexSlider elements. Example uses: $('#slider').flexslider(""play"") //Play slideshow $('#slider').flexslider(""pause"") //Pause slideshow $('#slider').flexslider(""stop"") //Stop slideshow $('#slider').flexslider(""next"") //Go to next slide $('#slider').flexslider(""prev"") //Go to previous slide $('#slider').flexslider(3) //Go fourth slide Two new methods are available for adding/removing slides, slider.addSlide() and slider.removeSlide(). More details about this coming soon. slider.addSlide(obj, pos) accepts two parameters, a string/jQuery object and an index. slider.removeSlide(obj) accepts one parameter, either an object to be removed, or an index. Examples Basic Slider Basic Slider customDirectionNav Slider w/thumbnail controlNav pattern Slider w/thumbnail slider Basic Carousel Carousel with min and max ranges Video with Vimeo API Video with Wistia API Properties namespace: {new} namespace controls the prefixes attached to elements created by the plugin. In previous releases, only certain elements were tagged with a prefix class, which was causing class generalization issues for some users. FlexSlider now prefixes all generated elements with the appropriate namespace. Hint: namespace can be an empty string. selector: {new} The markup structure for FlexSlider has been limited to a ""ul.slide li"" pattern in previous versions of FlexSlider; no longer. You can now take full control of the markup structure used for your FlexSlider. The selector pattern ""{container} > {slide}"" is mandatory, allowing the plugin to predictably interpret the selector property. Omitting the "">"" from the selector is not suggested, but is possible if your markup doesn't follow the immediate descendant pattern. Examples: ""section > article"", "".slides > .slide"", ""#hero .slide"" easing: {new} easing allows support for jQuery easing! Default options provided by jQuery are ""swing"" and ""linear,"" but more can be used by included the jQuery Easing plugin. If you chose a non-existent easing method, the slider will break. Note: You need to set useCSS: false to force transitions in browsers that support translate3d. Optional: jQuery Easing Plugin direction: {changed} Previously called ""slideDirection"" in v1.8 and below. reverse: {new} reverse will reverse the animation direction of the slider. Meaning, horizontal sliders can move from right to left, and vertical sliders can move bottom to top. smoothHeight: {new} smoothHeight allows for smooth height transitions between slides. This property currently works for the fade and horizontal slide animation. The property has no effect on horizontal sliding carousels, however. startAt: {changed} Previously called ""slideToStart"" in v1.8 and below. animationSpeed: {changed} Previously called ""animationDuration"" in v1.8 and below. initDelay: {new} initDelay will delay the initial slideshow of a slider, given in milliseconds. The slider will still initialize, generating controls and displaying the first image, but the slideshow will wait until the initDelay time has completed before starting the slideshow. useCSS: {new} useCSS allow users to override using CSS3 for animation. Translate3d still has numerous bugs that can crop up and wreak havoc, so this is a great property to play with if you are experiencing unexplainable issues in Webkit browsers. Hint: Use conditionals to enable/disable the use of CSS3 on desktops and mobile devices. Mobile devices, in my experience, do not share many of the translate3d bugs seen on desktop browsers. touch: {new} touch allows users to exclude touch swipe functionality from their sliders. keyboard: {changed} Previously called ""keyboardNav"" in v1.8 and below. multipleKeyboard {new} multipleKeyboard allows users to override the default plugin keyboard behavior, enabling keyboard control of more than one slider on the page. This means that all visible sliders will animate, at the same time, via keyboard input. Hint: You can use multipleKeyboard to allow keyboard navigation on pages where multiple sliders are present, but only one is visible. mousewheel: {updated} mousewheel now requires the jQuery Mousewheel plugin. There are a few reasons for this, but primarily because there is no need for FlexSlider itself to reinvent the awkward complexity of mousewheel interactivity that is handled perfectly by the Mousewheel plugin. Required: jQuery Mousewheel Plugin controlsContainer: {updated} controlsContainer is one of the more painstaking, potentially confusing properties within FlexSlider. First, the property is no longer required to workaround overflow: hidden on slide animation. Second, the property now accepts a jQuery object, giving you precise control over the object you want. The plugin no longer attempts to guess what element you are selecting. customDirectionNav: {new} customDirectionNav allows the ability to add custom directional navigation elements. Can be used in conjunction with controlsContainer for pagination controls container. Example of customDirectionNav being used sync: {new} sync is a new property that will allow other slider(s) to hook into the current slider via a given selector. The selector should describe an object that has already been initialized as a FlexSlider. Right now, sync will synchronize animation, play, and pause behaviors. More behaviors can be added in the future as the property matures. Example of sync being used asNavFor: {new} Description to be added. itemWidth: {new} itemWidth is the primary property for the new carousel options. Without this property, your slider is not considered a carousel. To use itemWidth, give an integer value of the width of your individual slides. This should include borders and paddings applied to your slides; a total width measurement. itemMargin: {new} itemMargin describes the gutter between the slide elements. If each slide has a margin-left of 10px, your itemMargin value would be 10. If elements have margin: 0 10px, your itemMargin would be 20. minItems: {new} minItems describes the minimum number of slide elements that should be visible in the carousel. When the slider reaches the minimum item count, the slides will resize fluidly with the slider. maxItems: {new} maxItems describes the maximum number of slide elements that should be visible in the carousel. When the slider reaches the maximum item count, the slides will resize fluidly with the sider. move: {new} move determines how many slides should be animated within the carousel. When left at 0, the slider will animate the number of visible slides. If any value greater than 0 is given, the slider will animate that number of slides in the carousel on each animation interval. Hint: The move property will be ignored if the value is higher than the number of visible slides, which can be utilized in responsive design. added: {new} added() is a new callback event fired in the new slider.addSlide() function. removed: {new} removed() is a new callback event fired in the new slider.removeSlide() function. allowOneSlide: {new} Boolean. Whether or not you'd like FlexSlider to initialize as usual if only one slide is present. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Sly supports navigation with: mouse wheel scrolling scrollbar (dragging the handle or clicking on scrollbar) pages bar various navigation buttons content dragging with mouse or touch automated cycling by items or pages lots of super useful methods ... and has a powerful & developer friendly API! That's all build around a custom highly optimized animation rendering with requestAnimationFrame, and GPU accelerated positioning with fallbacks for browsers that don't support it. Dependencies jQuery 1.7+ Compatibility Works everywhere, even in IE6+ abominations, but that is a complete accident :) IE 6-7 are not officially supported. Forum Forum is for questions. Issues are for bug reports and feature requests. Don't mix the two :) Usage Constructor: var options = {     horizontal: 1,     itemNav: 'basic',     speed: 300,     mouseDragging: 1,     touchDragging: 1 }; var frame = new Sly('#frame', options).init(); jQuery proxy: var options = {     horizontal: 1,     itemNav: 'basic',     speed: 300,     mouseDragging: 1,     touchDragging: 1 }; $('#frame').sly(options); jQuery proxy is good when you want to create an instance and forget about it. For anything more complex, like using methods, events, accessing instance properties, ... use the constructor and work with the instance directly.

Online Editor Presentations are written using HTML or Markdown but there's also an online editor for those of you who prefer a graphical interface. Give it a try at https://slides.com. Instructions Markup Here's a barebones example of a fully working reveal.js presentation: <html>     <head>         <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/reveal.css"">         <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/theme/white.css"">     </head>     <body>         <div class=""reveal"">             <div class=""slides"">                 <section>Slide 1</section>                 <section>Slide 2</section>             </div>         </div>         <script src=""js/reveal.js""></script>         <script>             Reveal.initialize();         </script>     </body> </html> The presentation markup hierarchy needs to be .reveal > .slides > section where the section represents one slide and can be repeated indefinitely. If you place multiple section elements inside of another section they will be shown as vertical slides. The first of the vertical slides is the ""root"" of the others (at the top), and will be included in the horizontal sequence. For example: <div class=""reveal"">     <div class=""slides"">         <section>Single Horizontal Slide</section>         <section>             <section>Vertical Slide 1</section>             <section>Vertical Slide 2</section>         </section>     </div> </div> Markdown It's possible to write your slides using Markdown. To enable Markdown, add the data-markdown attribute to your <section> elements and wrap the contents in a <script type=""text/template""> like the example below. This is based on data-markdown from Paul Irish modified to use marked to support GitHub Flavored Markdown. Sensitive to indentation (avoid mixing tabs and spaces) and line breaks (avoid consecutive breaks). <section data-markdown>     <script type=""text/template"">         ## Page title          A paragraph with some text and a [link](http://hakim.se).     </script> </section> External Markdown You can write your content as a separate file and have reveal.js load it at runtime. Note the separator arguments which determine how slides are delimited in the external file. The data-charset attribute is optional and specifies which charset to use when loading the external file. When used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js runs from a local web server. <section data-markdown=""example.md""            data-separator=""^\n\n\n""            data-separator-vertical=""^\n\n""            data-separator-notes=""^Note:""            data-charset=""iso-8859-15""> </section> Element Attributes Special syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to Markdown elements. This is useful for fragments, amongst other things. <section data-markdown>     <script type=""text/template"">         - Item 1 <!-- .element: class=""fragment"" data-fragment-index=""2"" -->         - Item 2 <!-- .element: class=""fragment"" data-fragment-index=""1"" -->     </script> </section> Slide Attributes Special syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to the slide <section> elements generated by your Markdown. <section data-markdown>     <script type=""text/template"">     <!-- .slide: data-background=""#ff0000"" -->         Markdown content     </script> </section> Configuration At the end of your page you need to initialize reveal by running the following code. Note that all config values are optional and will default as specified below. Reveal.initialize({      // Display controls in the bottom right corner     controls: true,      // Display a presentation progress bar     progress: true,      // Display the page number of the current slide     slideNumber: false,      // Push each slide change to the browser history     history: false,      // Enable keyboard shortcuts for navigation     keyboard: true,      // Enable the slide overview mode     overview: true,      // Vertical centering of slides     center: true,      // Enables touch navigation on devices with touch input     touch: true,      // Loop the presentation     loop: false,      // Change the presentation direction to be RTL     rtl: false,      // Randomizes the order of slides each time the presentation loads     shuffle: false,      // Turns fragments on and off globally     fragments: true,      // Flags if the presentation is running in an embedded mode,     // i.e. contained within a limited portion of the screen     embedded: false,      // Flags if we should show a help overlay when the questionmark     // key is pressed     help: true,      // Flags if speaker notes should be visible to all viewers     showNotes: false,      // Number of milliseconds between automatically proceeding to the     // next slide, disabled when set to 0, this value can be overwritten     // by using a data-autoslide attribute on your slides     autoSlide: 0,      // Stop auto-sliding after user input     autoSlideStoppable: true,      // Use this method for navigation when auto-sliding     autoSlideMethod: Reveal.navigateNext,      // Enable slide navigation via mouse wheel     mouseWheel: false,      // Hides the address bar on mobile devices     hideAddressBar: true,      // Opens links in an iframe preview overlay     previewLinks: false,      // Transition style     transition: 'default', // none/fade/slide/convex/concave/zoom      // Transition speed     transitionSpeed: 'default', // default/fast/slow      // Transition style for full page slide backgrounds     backgroundTransition: 'default', // none/fade/slide/convex/concave/zoom      // Number of slides away from the current that are visible     viewDistance: 3,      // Parallax background image     parallaxBackgroundImage: '', // e.g. ""'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg'""      // Parallax background size     parallaxBackgroundSize: '', // CSS syntax, e.g. ""2100px 900px""      // Number of pixels to move the parallax background per slide     // - Calculated automatically unless specified     // - Set to 0 to disable movement along an axis     parallaxBackgroundHorizontal: null,     parallaxBackgroundVertical: null  }); The configuration can be updated after initialization using the configure method: // Turn autoSlide off Reveal.configure({ autoSlide: 0 });  // Start auto-sliding every 5s Reveal.configure({ autoSlide: 5000 }); Presentation Size All presentations have a normal size, that is the resolution at which they are authored. The framework will automatically scale presentations uniformly based on this size to ensure that everything fits on any given display or viewport. See below for a list of configuration options related to sizing, including default values: Reveal.initialize({      ...      // The ""normal"" size of the presentation, aspect ratio will be preserved     // when the presentation is scaled to fit different resolutions. Can be     // specified using percentage units.     width: 960,     height: 700,      // Factor of the display size that should remain empty around the content     margin: 0.1,      // Bounds for smallest/largest possible scale to apply to content     minScale: 0.2,     maxScale: 1.5  }); Dependencies Reveal.js doesn't rely on any third party scripts to work but a few optional libraries are included by default. These libraries are loaded as dependencies in the order they appear, for example: Reveal.initialize({     dependencies: [         // Cross-browser shim that fully implements classList - https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js/         { src: 'lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } },          // Interpret Markdown in <section> elements         { src: 'plugin/markdown/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },         { src: 'plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },          // Syntax highlight for <code> elements         { src: 'plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } },          // Zoom in and out with Alt+click         { src: 'plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true },          // Speaker notes         { src: 'plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true },          // MathJax         { src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true }     ] }); You can add your own extensions using the same syntax. The following properties are available for each dependency object: src: Path to the script to load async: [optional] Flags if the script should load after reveal.js has started, defaults to false callback: [optional] Function to execute when the script has loaded condition: [optional] Function which must return true for the script to be loaded Ready Event A 'ready' event is fired when reveal.js has loaded all non-async dependencies and is ready to start navigating. To check if reveal.js is already 'ready' you can call Reveal.isReady(). Reveal.addEventListener( 'ready', function( event ) {     // event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv } ); Auto-sliding Presentations can be configured to progress through slides automatically, without any user input. To enable this you will need to tell the framework how many milliseconds it should wait between slides: // Slide every five seconds Reveal.configure({   autoSlide: 5000 }); When this is turned on a control element will appear that enables users to pause and resume auto-sliding. Alternatively, sliding can be paused or resumed by pressing »a« on the keyboard. Sliding is paused automatically as soon as the user starts navigating. You can disable these controls by specifying autoSlideStoppable: false in your reveal.js config. You can also override the slide duration for individual slides and fragments by using the data-autoslide attribute: <section data-autoslide=""2000"">     <p>After 2 seconds the first fragment will be shown.</p>     <p class=""fragment"" data-autoslide=""10000"">After 10 seconds the next fragment will be shown.</p>     <p class=""fragment"">Now, the fragment is displayed for 2 seconds before the next slide is shown.</p> </section> To override the method used for navigation when auto-sliding, you can specify the autoSlideMethod setting. To only navigate along the top layer and ignore vertical slides, set this to Reveal.navigateRight. Whenever the auto-slide mode is resumed or paused the autoslideresumed and autoslidepaused events are fired. Keyboard Bindings If you're unhappy with any of the default keyboard bindings you can override them using the keyboard config option: Reveal.configure({   keyboard: {     13: 'next', // go to the next slide when the ENTER key is pressed     27: function() {}, // do something custom when ESC is pressed     32: null // don't do anything when SPACE is pressed (i.e. disable a reveal.js default binding)   } }); Touch Navigation You can swipe to navigate through a presentation on any touch-enabled device. Horizontal swipes change between horizontal slides, vertical swipes change between vertical slides. If you wish to disable this you can set the touch config option to false when initializing reveal.js. If there's some part of your content that needs to remain accessible to touch events you'll need to highlight this by adding a data-prevent-swipe attribute to the element. One common example where this is useful is elements that need to be scrolled. Lazy Loading When working on presentation with a lot of media or iframe content it's important to load lazily. Lazy loading means that reveal.js will only load content for the few slides nearest to the current slide. The number of slides that are preloaded is determined by the viewDistance configuration option. To enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your ""src"" attributes to ""data-src"" as shown below. This is supported for image, video, audio and iframe elements. Lazy loaded iframes will also unload when the containing slide is no longer visible. <section>   <img data-src=""image.png"">   <iframe data-src=""http://hakim.se""></iframe>   <video>     <source data-src=""video.webm"" type=""video/webm"" />     <source data-src=""video.mp4"" type=""video/mp4"" />   </video> </section> API The Reveal object exposes a JavaScript API for controlling navigation and reading state: // Navigation Reveal.slide( indexh, indexv, indexf ); Reveal.left(); Reveal.right(); Reveal.up(); Reveal.down(); Reveal.prev(); Reveal.next(); Reveal.prevFragment(); Reveal.nextFragment();  // Randomize the order of slides Reveal.shuffle();  // Toggle presentation states, optionally pass true/false to force on/off Reveal.toggleOverview(); Reveal.togglePause(); Reveal.toggleAutoSlide();  // Change a config value at runtime Reveal.configure({ controls: true });  // Returns the present configuration options Reveal.getConfig();  // Fetch the current scale of the presentation Reveal.getScale();  // Retrieves the previous and current slide elements Reveal.getPreviousSlide(); Reveal.getCurrentSlide();  Reveal.getIndices(); // { h: 0, v: 0 } } Reveal.getProgress(); // 0-1 Reveal.getTotalSlides();  // Returns the speaker notes for the current slide Reveal.getSlideNotes();  // State checks Reveal.isFirstSlide(); Reveal.isLastSlide(); Reveal.isOverview(); Reveal.isPaused(); Reveal.isAutoSliding(); Slide Changed Event A 'slidechanged' event is fired each time the slide is changed (regardless of state). The event object holds the index values of the current slide as well as a reference to the previous and current slide HTML nodes. Some libraries, like MathJax (see #226), get confused by the transforms and display states of slides. Often times, this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback. Reveal.addEventListener( 'slidechanged', function( event ) {     // event.previousSlide, event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv } ); Presentation State The presentation's current state can be fetched by using the getState method. A state object contains all of the information required to put the presentation back as it was when getState was first called. Sort of like a snapshot. It's a simple object that can easily be stringified and persisted or sent over the wire. Reveal.slide( 1 ); // we're on slide 1  var state = Reveal.getState();  Reveal.slide( 3 ); // we're on slide 3  Reveal.setState( state ); // we're back on slide 1 Slide States If you set data-state=""somestate"" on a slide <section>, ""somestate"" will be applied as a class on the document element when that slide is opened. This allows you to apply broad style changes to the page based on the active slide. Furthermore you can also listen to these changes in state via JavaScript: Reveal.addEventListener( 'somestate', function() {     // TODO: Sprinkle magic }, false ); Slide Backgrounds Slides are contained within a limited portion of the screen by default to allow them to fit any display and scale uniformly. You can apply full page backgrounds outside of the slide area by adding a data-background attribute to your <section> elements. Four different types of backgrounds are supported: color, image, video and iframe. Color Backgrounds All CSS color formats are supported, like rgba() or hsl(). <section data-background-color=""#ff0000"">     <h2>Color</h2> </section> Image Backgrounds By default, background images are resized to cover the full page. Available options: Attribute Default Description data-background-image URL of the image to show. GIFs restart when the slide opens. data-background-size cover See background-size on MDN. data-background-position center See background-position on MDN. data-background-repeat no-repeat See background-repeat on MDN. <section data-background-image=""http://example.com/image.png"">     <h2>Image</h2> </section> <section data-background-image=""http://example.com/image.png"" data-background-size=""100px"" data-background-repeat=""repeat"">     <h2>This background image will be sized to 100px and repeated</h2> </section> Video Backgrounds Automatically plays a full size video behind the slide. Attribute Default Description data-background-video A single video source, or a comma separated list of video sources. data-background-video-loop false Flags if the video should play repeatedly. data-background-video-muted false Flags if the audio should be muted. <section data-background-video=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.mp4,https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.webm"" data-background-video-loop data-background-video-muted>     <h2>Video</h2> </section> Iframe Backgrounds Embeds a web page as a background. Note that since the iframe is in the background layer, behind your slides, it is not possible to interact with the embedded page. <section data-background-iframe=""https://slides.com"">     <h2>Iframe</h2> </section> Background Transitions Backgrounds transition using a fade animation by default. This can be changed to a linear sliding transition by passing backgroundTransition: 'slide' to the Reveal.initialize() call. Alternatively you can set data-background-transition on any section with a background to override that specific transition. Parallax Background If you want to use a parallax scrolling background, set the first two config properties below when initializing reveal.js (the other two are optional). Reveal.initialize({      // Parallax background image     parallaxBackgroundImage: '', // e.g. ""https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg""      // Parallax background size     parallaxBackgroundSize: '', // CSS syntax, e.g. ""2100px 900px"" - currently only pixels are supported (don't use % or auto)      // Number of pixels to move the parallax background per slide     // - Calculated automatically unless specified     // - Set to 0 to disable movement along an axis     parallaxBackgroundHorizontal: 200,     parallaxBackgroundVertical: 50  }); Make sure that the background size is much bigger than screen size to allow for some scrolling. View example. Slide Transitions The global presentation transition is set using the transition config value. You can override the global transition for a specific slide by using the data-transition attribute: <section data-transition=""zoom"">     <h2>This slide will override the presentation transition and zoom!</h2> </section>  <section data-transition-speed=""fast"">     <h2>Choose from three transition speeds: default, fast or slow!</h2> </section> You can also use different in and out transitions for the same slide: <section data-transition=""slide"">     The train goes on … </section> <section data-transition=""slide"">     and on … </section> <section data-transition=""slide-in fade-out"">     and stops. </section> <section data-transition=""fade-in slide-out"">     (Passengers entering and leaving) </section> <section data-transition=""slide"">     And it starts again. </section> Internal links It's easy to link between slides. The first example below targets the index of another slide whereas the second targets a slide with an ID attribute (<section id=""some-slide"">): <a href=""#/2/2"">Link</a> <a href=""#/some-slide"">Link</a> You can also add relative navigation links, similar to the built in reveal.js controls, by appending one of the following classes on any element. Note that each element is automatically given an enabled class when it's a valid navigation route based on the current slide. <a href=""#"" class=""navigate-left""> <a href=""#"" class=""navigate-right""> <a href=""#"" class=""navigate-up""> <a href=""#"" class=""navigate-down""> <a href=""#"" class=""navigate-prev""> <!-- Previous vertical or horizontal slide --> <a href=""#"" class=""navigate-next""> <!-- Next vertical or horizontal slide --> Fragments Fragments are used to highlight individual elements on a slide. Every element with the class fragment will be stepped through before moving on to the next slide. Here's an example: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/fragments The default fragment style is to start out invisible and fade in. This style can be changed by appending a different class to the fragment: <section>     <p class=""fragment grow"">grow</p>     <p class=""fragment shrink"">shrink</p>     <p class=""fragment fade-out"">fade-out</p>     <p class=""fragment fade-up"">fade-up (also down, left and right!)</p>     <p class=""fragment current-visible"">visible only once</p>     <p class=""fragment highlight-current-blue"">blue only once</p>     <p class=""fragment highlight-red"">highlight-red</p>     <p class=""fragment highlight-green"">highlight-green</p>     <p class=""fragment highlight-blue"">highlight-blue</p> </section> Multiple fragments can be applied to the same element sequentially by wrapping it, this will fade in the text on the first step and fade it back out on the second. <section>     <span class=""fragment fade-in"">         <span class=""fragment fade-out"">I'll fade in, then out</span>     </span> </section> The display order of fragments can be controlled using the data-fragment-index attribute. <section>     <p class=""fragment"" data-fragment-index=""3"">Appears last</p>     <p class=""fragment"" data-fragment-index=""1"">Appears first</p>     <p class=""fragment"" data-fragment-index=""2"">Appears second</p> </section> Fragment events When a slide fragment is either shown or hidden reveal.js will dispatch an event. Some libraries, like MathJax (see #505), get confused by the initially hidden fragment elements. Often times this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback. Reveal.addEventListener( 'fragmentshown', function( event ) {     // event.fragment = the fragment DOM element } ); Reveal.addEventListener( 'fragmenthidden', function( event ) {     // event.fragment = the fragment DOM element } ); Code syntax highlighting By default, Reveal is configured with highlight.js for code syntax highlighting. Below is an example with clojure code that will be syntax highlighted. When the data-trim attribute is present, surrounding whitespace is automatically removed. HTML will be escaped by default. To avoid this, for example if you are using <mark> to call out a line of code, add the data-noescape attribute to the <code> element. <section>     <pre><code data-trim data-noescape> (def lazy-fib   (concat    [0 1]    <mark>((fn rfib [a b]</mark>         (lazy-cons (+ a b) (rfib b (+ a b)))) 0 1)))     </code></pre> </section> Slide number If you would like to display the page number of the current slide you can do so using the slideNumber configuration value. // Shows the slide number using default formatting Reveal.configure({ slideNumber: true });  // Slide number formatting can be configured using these variables: //  ""h.v"":  horizontal . vertical slide number (default) //  ""h/v"":  horizontal / vertical slide number //    ""c"":  flattened slide number //  ""c/t"":  flattened slide number / total slides Reveal.configure({ slideNumber: 'c/t' });  Overview mode Press ""Esc"" or ""o"" keys to toggle the overview mode on and off. While you're in this mode, you can still navigate between slides, as if you were at 1,000 feet above your presentation. The overview mode comes with a few API hooks: Reveal.addEventListener( 'overviewshown', function( event ) { /* ... */ } ); Reveal.addEventListener( 'overviewhidden', function( event ) { /* ... */ } );  // Toggle the overview mode programmatically Reveal.toggleOverview(); Fullscreen mode Just press »F« on your keyboard to show your presentation in fullscreen mode. Press the »ESC« key to exit fullscreen mode. Embedded media Embedded HTML5 <video>/<audio> and YouTube iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a slide. This can be disabled by decorating your element with a data-ignore attribute. Add data-autoplay to your media element if you want it to automatically start playing when the slide is shown: <video data-autoplay src=""http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4""></video> Additionally the framework automatically pushes two post messages to all iframes, slide:start when the slide containing the iframe is made visible and slide:stop when it is hidden. Stretching elements Sometimes it's desirable to have an element, like an image or video, stretch to consume as much space as possible within a given slide. This can be done by adding the .stretch class to an element as seen below: <section>     <h2>This video will use up the remaining space on the slide</h2>     <video class=""stretch"" src=""http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4""></video> </section> Limitations: Only direct descendants of a slide section can be stretched Only one descendant per slide section can be stretched postMessage API The framework has a built-in postMessage API that can be used when communicating with a presentation inside of another window. Here's an example showing how you'd make a reveal.js instance in the given window proceed to slide 2: <window>.postMessage( JSON.stringify({ method: 'slide', args: [ 2 ] }), '*' ); When reveal.js runs inside of an iframe it can optionally bubble all of its events to the parent. Bubbled events are stringified JSON with three fields: namespace, eventName and state. Here's how you subscribe to them from the parent window: window.addEventListener( 'message', function( event ) {     var data = JSON.parse( event.data );     if( data.namespace === 'reveal' && data.eventName ==='slidechanged' ) {         // Slide changed, see data.state for slide number     } } ); This cross-window messaging can be toggled on or off using configuration flags. Reveal.initialize({     ...,      // Exposes the reveal.js API through window.postMessage     postMessage: true,      // Dispatches all reveal.js events to the parent window through postMessage     postMessageEvents: false }); PDF Export Presentations can be exported to PDF via a special print stylesheet. This feature requires that you use Google Chrome or Chromium. Here's an example of an exported presentation that's been uploaded to SlideShare: http://www.slideshare.net/hakimel/revealjs-300. Open your presentation with print-pdf included anywhere in the query string. This triggers the default index HTML to load the PDF print stylesheet (css/print/pdf.css). You can test this with lab.hakim.se/reveal-js?print-pdf. Open the in-browser print dialog (CTRL/CMD+P). Change the Destination setting to Save as PDF. Change the Layout to Landscape. Change the Margins to None. Enable the Background graphics option. Click Save. Alternatively you can use the decktape project. Theming The framework comes with a few different themes included: black: Black background, white text, blue links (default theme) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links (default theme for reveal.js < 3.0.0) beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Each theme is available as a separate stylesheet. To change theme you will need to replace black below with your desired theme name in index.html: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/theme/black.css"" id=""theme""> If you want to add a theme of your own see the instructions here: /css/theme/README.md. Speaker Notes reveal.js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven't written any notes. Press the 's' key on your keyboard to open the notes window. Notes are defined by appending an <aside> element to a slide as seen below. You can add the data-markdown attribute to the aside element if you prefer writing notes using Markdown. Alternatively you can add your notes in a data-notes attribute on the slide. Like <section data-notes=""Something important""></section>. When used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js runs from a local web server. <section>     <h2>Some Slide</h2>      <aside class=""notes"">         Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).     </aside> </section> If you're using the external Markdown plugin, you can add notes with the help of a special delimiter: <section data-markdown=""example.md"" data-separator=""^\n\n\n"" data-separator-vertical=""^\n\n"" data-separator-notes=""^Note:""></section>  # Title ## Sub-title  Here is some content...  Note: This will only display in the notes window. Share and Print Speaker Notes Notes are only visible to the speaker inside of the speaker view. If you wish to share your notes with others you can initialize reveal.js with the showNotes config value set to true. Notes will appear along the bottom of the presentations. When showNotes is enabled notes are also included when you export to PDF. Server Side Speaker Notes In some cases it can be desirable to run notes on a separate device from the one you're presenting on. The Node.js-based notes plugin lets you do this using the same note definitions as its client side counterpart. Include the required scripts by adding the following dependencies: Reveal.initialize({     ...      dependencies: [         { src: 'socket.io/socket.io.js', async: true },         { src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true }     ] }); Then: Install Node.js (1.0.0 or later) Run npm install Run node plugin/notes-server Multiplexing The multiplex plugin allows your audience to view the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone, tablet or laptop. As the master presentation navigates the slides, all client presentations will update in real time. See a demo at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/. The multiplex plugin needs the following 3 things to operate: Master presentation that has control Client presentations that follow the master Socket.io server to broadcast events from the master to the clients More details: Master presentation Served from a static file server accessible (preferably) only to the presenter. This need only be on your (the presenter's) computer. (It's safer to run the master presentation from your own computer, so if the venue's Internet goes down it doesn't stop the show.) An example would be to execute the following commands in the directory of your master presentation: npm install node-static static If you want to use the speaker notes plugin with your master presentation then make sure you have the speaker notes plugin configured correctly along with the configuration shown below, then execute node plugin/notes-server in the directory of your master presentation. The configuration below will cause it to connect to the socket.io server as a master, as well as launch your speaker-notes/static-file server. You can then access your master presentation at http://localhost:1947 Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({     // other options...      multiplex: {         // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.         secret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation         id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server         url: 'https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh' // Location of socket.io server     },      // Don't forget to add the dependencies     dependencies: [         { src: '//cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.3.5.js', async: true },         { src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true },          // and if you want speaker notes         { src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true }          // other dependencies...     ] }); Client presentation Served from a publicly accessible static file server. Examples include: GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, Dreamhost, Akamai, etc. The more reliable, the better. Your audience can then access the client presentation via http://example.com/path/to/presentation/client/index.html, with the configuration below causing them to connect to the socket.io server as clients. Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({     // other options...      multiplex: {         // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.         secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation         id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server         url: 'https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh' // Location of socket.io server     },      // Don't forget to add the dependencies     dependencies: [         { src: '//cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.3.5.js', async: true },         { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true }          // other dependencies...     ] }); Socket.io server Server that receives the slideChanged events from the master presentation and broadcasts them out to the connected client presentations. This needs to be publicly accessible. You can run your own socket.io server with the commands: npm install node plugin/multiplex Or you use the socket.io server at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/. You'll need to generate a unique secret and token pair for your master and client presentations. To do so, visit http://example.com/token, where http://example.com is the location of your socket.io server. Or if you're going to use the socket.io server at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/, visit https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/token. You are very welcome to point your presentations at the Socket.io server running at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/, but availability and stability are not guaranteed. For anything mission critical I recommend you run your own server. It is simple to deploy to nodejitsu, heroku, your own environment, etc. socket.io server as file static server The socket.io server can play the role of static file server for your client presentation, as in the example at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/. (Open https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/ in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match.) Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({     // other options...      multiplex: {         // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.         secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation         id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server         url: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server     },      // Don't forget to add the dependencies     dependencies: [         { src: '//cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.3.5.js', async: true },         { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true }          // other dependencies...     ] It can also play the role of static file server for your master presentation and client presentations at the same time (as long as you don't want to use speaker notes). (Open https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/ in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match. Navigate through the slides on the second, and the first will update to match.) This is probably not desirable, because you don't want your audience to mess with your slides while you're presenting. ;) Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({     // other options...      multiplex: {         // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.         secret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation         id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server         url: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server     },      // Don't forget to add the dependencies     dependencies: [         { src: '//cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.3.5.js', async: true },         { src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true },         { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true }          // other dependencies...     ] }); MathJax If you want to display math equations in your presentation you can easily do so by including this plugin. The plugin is a very thin wrapper around the MathJax library. To use it you'll need to include it as a reveal.js dependency, find our more about dependencies here. The plugin defaults to using LaTeX but that can be adjusted through the math configuration object. Note that MathJax is loaded from a remote server. If you want to use it offline you'll need to download a copy of the library and adjust the mathjax configuration value. Below is an example of how the plugin can be configured. If you don't intend to change these values you do not need to include the math config object at all. Reveal.initialize({      // other options ...      math: {         mathjax: 'https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js',         config: 'TeX-AMS_HTML-full'  // See http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/config-files.html     },      dependencies: [         { src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true }     ]  }); Read MathJax's documentation if you need HTTPS delivery or serving of specific versions for stability. Installation The basic setup is for authoring presentations only. The full setup gives you access to all reveal.js features and plugins such as speaker notes as well as the development tasks needed to make changes to the source. Basic setup The core of reveal.js is very easy to install. You'll simply need to download a copy of this repository and open the index.html file directly in your browser. Download the latest version of reveal.js from https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases Unzip and replace the example contents in index.html with your own Open index.html in a browser to view it Full setup Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code. Install Node.js (1.0.0 or later) Clone the reveal.js repository $ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git Navigate to the reveal.js folder $ cd reveal.js Install dependencies $ npm install Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes $ npm start Open http://localhost:8000 to view your presentation You can change the port by using npm start -- --port 8001.

The core library sets up the presentation, provides a simple control API and manages events. Any other functionality is implemented as a plugin. Joining the Bespoke.js ecosystem is simple with the suite of official Yeoman generators: Bespoke.js Generator Bespoke.js Plugin Generator Bespoke.js Theme Generator Creating a Presentation Due to the highly modular nature of Bespoke.js, the quickest way to get started is with Bespoke.js Generator, a Yeoman generator that scaffolds a boilerplate presentation with a Gulp build system. Assuming you have Node.js installed, in a blank directory: $ npm install -g generator-bespoke $ yo bespoke In your newly scaffolded project, you can use the following Gulp tasks: $ gulp serve to run a preview server with LiveReload. $ gulp deploy to deploy to GitHub Pages. $ gulp to compile static assets to 'public'. For more detailed instructions, check out the Bespoke.js Generator repo. If you'd prefer to craft a new presentation from scratch, you can install Bespoke.js from npm with npm install bespoke, Bower with bower install bespoke.js, or manually download either the production version or the development version. The Bespoke.js core is extremely lightweight, so you'll probably want to include some plugins. Basic Usage Loading Bespoke Bespoke.js is shipped in a UMD format, meaning that bespoke and its plugins are available as CommonJS/AMD modules or browser globals. Markup It's completely up to you which tags you use, but the following is a good starting point: <article id=""presentation"">   <section>Slide 1</section>   <section>Slide 2</section>   <section>Slide 3</section> </article> JavaScript To create a new presentation, Bespoke.js provides the from(selector[, plugins]) method, which takes a selector or element reference and an array of plugins, and returns a deck instance. var deck = bespoke.from('#presentation', [plugins]);  // Next slide deck.next();  // Previous slide deck.prev();  // Go to a specific slide deck.slide(0);  // Get the active slide index deck.slide(); // 0 By default, all non-script child elements of the resolved parent element become slides. Plugins Official Plugins All official plugins can be installed from npm or Bower, e.g. $ npm install bespoke-keys or $ bower install bespoke-touch bespoke-keys for keyboard interaction. bespoke-touch for touch interaction. bespoke-classes for deck status classes. bespoke-bullets for animated bullet lists. bespoke-scale for responsive slide scaling. bespoke-hash for hash routing. bespoke-backdrop for animated backdrop elements. bespoke-state for slide-specific deck styles. bespoke-progress for progress bars. bespoke-forms for form element support. bespoke-loop for looped presentations. bespoke-vcr for recording and playback. All Plugins You can view the full list of Bespoke.js plugins on npm by browsing the bespoke-plugin keyword. Using Plugins All official plugins are provided in a UMD format, meaning they are available as CommonJS/AMD modules or browser globals. For example, if you're using CommonJS modules via browserify or webpack, it would look something like this: var bespoke = require('bespoke'),   classes = require('bespoke-classes'),   keys = require('bespoke-keys'),   touch = require('bespoke-touch');  var deck = bespoke.from('#presentation', [   classes(),   keys(),   touch() ]); If you're using browser globals, all official plugins are added to the bespoke.plugins object, for example: var deck = bespoke.from('#presentation', [   bespoke.plugins.classes(),   bespoke.plugins.keys(),   bespoke.plugins.touch() ]); Themes Official Themes Cube — (view demo) Voltaire — (view demo) Nebula — (view demo) As with plugins, all official themes can be installed from npm or Bower, e.g. $ npm install bespoke-theme-cube or $ bower install bespoke-theme-voltaire All Themes You can view the full list of Bespoke.js themes on npm by browsing the bespoke-theme keyword. Using Themes Themes are included just like any other plugin: var bespoke = require('bespoke'),   cube = require('bespoke-theme-cube'),   keys = require('bespoke-keys'),   touch = require('bespoke-touch');  var deck = bespoke.from('#presentation', [   cube(),   keys(),   touch() ]); If you're using browser globals, all official themes are added to the bespoke.themes object, for example: var deck = bespoke.from('#presentation', [   bespoke.themes.cube(),   bespoke.plugins.keys(),   bespoke.plugins.touch() ]); Advanced Usage From HTMLElement If you already have a reference to a DOM node, you can pass it directly to the from method. bespoke.from(element); Slide Selector You can specify which elements become slides by passing an options Hash containing the key parent and, optionally, the key slides) to the from method. The value of either key can be a CSS selector or a DOM node. bespoke.from({ parent: selectorOrElement, slides: selectorOrElementList }); For example: bespoke.from({ parent: '#presentation', slides: '#presentation > section' }); This advanced usage allows you to include auxilary HTML inside the parent element, skip slides that don't match the selector or explicitly filter out slides before passing on the collection. Deck Instances Deck instances are provided to plugins and returned when instantiating a presentation. The following properties are available on each instance. Note: The optional eventData parameter is an object that will be merged with the event object in subsequent event handlers. next([eventData]) Next slide. prev([eventData]) Previous slide. slide([index[, eventData]]) Get or set the active slide index. on(event, callback) Attach event handlers off(event, callback) Unbind event handlers fire(event[, eventData]) Fire custom events. This method is primarily designed for plugin authors. parent The deck's parent element slides An array of slide elements Events Binding Events Events are bound via the deck instance. Each event is passed an event object containing a reference to the relevant slide and its index. deck.on(eventName, function(event) {   event.slide; // Relevant slide   event.index; // Index of relevant slide    // Prevent default functionality (for deck interaction events only)   return false; }); Standard Events In most cases, you will only need to use these standard events. activate A slide has been activated. event.slide is the activated slide. deactivate A slide has been deactivated. event.slide is the deactivated slide. Deck Interaction Events These events are fired when the deck has been interacted with, but before the interaction has had any effect. This allows you to intercept the default behaviour by returning false from the event handler. next The next slide has been requested, even if last slide is active. event.slide is the current slide. prev The previous slide has been requested, even if first slide is active. event.slide is the current slide. slide A specific slide has been requested. event.slide is the requested slide. Unbinding events When binding events, the on method returns a function that can be used to remove the event handler. var off = deck.on('activate', function() {   // ... });  // Unbind event off(); You can also use the off method. However, you must use the same function reference that was used when registering the event. // Bind event deck.on('activate', onActivate);  // Unbind event deck.off('activate', onActivate); Creating Plugins Want a boilerplate plugin? Use the official Bespoke.js Plugin Generator. If you'd like to learn by example, check out the list of existing plugins. Basic Plugins Plugins are simply functions that are called when presentations are created. They are passed a deck instance which allows you to interact with the deck's state, bind events and modify its elements. To be consistent with the suite of official Bespoke.js plugins, it is highly recommended that you implement your plugin as a function that takes configuration and returns a plugin function. // Creating the plugin var myPlugin = function() {   return function() {     deck.on('activate', function(e) {       console.log('Activated slide ' + (e.index + 1) + ' of ' + deck.slides.length);     });   } }; The plugin can now be provided in the plugins array when using the from(selector[, plugins]) method. // Using the plugin bespoke.from('#presentation', [   myPlugin() ]); Plugins with Options If your plugin needs some configurability, your plugin factory function can take options and return a configured plugin function. // Creating the plugin with options var myPlugin = function(options) {   return function(deck) {     var showTotal = options && options.showTotal;      deck.on('activate', function(e) {       console.log('Activated slide ' + (e.index + 1) +         (showTotal ? ' of ' + deck.slides.length : ''));     });   } };  // Using the plugin with options bespoke.from('#presentation', [   myPlugin({ showTotal: true }) ]); Custom Event Data Additional event data can be supplied to next, prev and slide, which is merged with the final event object in subsequent event handlers. This functionality is particularly useful if you need to differentiate between events caused by your plugin, and those caused by your end users or other plugins. var myPlugin = function() {   return function(deck) {      // Differentiating our plugin's events     deck.on('activate', function(event) {       if (event.foo === 'bar') {         // Triggered by my plugin...       } else {         // Triggered by end user, or another plugin...       }     });      // Providing custom event data     deck.next({       foo: 'bar'     });    }; } Creating Themes Themes are essentially just plugins that also happen to insert styles into the page. You can quickly scaffold a boilerplate theme project with the official Bespoke.js Theme Generator.

Check out the ImpressJS demo presentation: http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/#/bored Start using Strut! http://strut.io/editor/ (works in Firefox, Chrome and Safari with basic support for IE10) Official Website: http://strut.io Learn a bit about Strut http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTpiDXEIulg previous video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA5s8wwme44 Twitter: @StrutPresents Mailing List strut-presentation-editor@googlegroups.com Development/Building To build your own version of Strut you'll need Grunt v0.4.0 or later. Install the latest Grunt: npm install -g grunt-cli Clone Strut: git clone git://github.com/tantaman/Strut.git cd Strut Install Strut's development dependencies: npm install Run Strut: grunt server (the server runs at localhost:9000) To make a production build of Strut run grunt build. The resulting build will be located in Strut/dist. RELEASE NOTES v0.5.3 - Positioning and transformations of components in edit mode now exactly match the positioning and transformations of components in the final presentation. Contributing Strut is composed of several bundles which provide distinct features to Strut. The set of bundles that compose Strut are defined in https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/blob/master/app/scripts/features.js This design allows features to be added and removed from Strut just by adding or removing bundles from the list in features.js. E.g., if you wanted a build of Strut without RemoteStorage you can just remove the RemoteStorage bundle from features.js. If you didn't want any slide components for some reason then you can remove strut/slide_components/main from features.js. Bundles contribute functionality to Strut by registering that functionality with the ServiceRegistry. You can take a look at the RemoteStorage bundle for an example: https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/blob/master/app/bundles/common/tantaman.web.remote_storage/main.js If a service is missing Strut continues to run without the functionality provided by that service. New development that isn't essential to the core of Strut should follow this pattern in order to keep the code modular and allow the removal of features that don't pan out or can only exist in specific environments. For example, RemoteStorage can't be loaded if Strut is being served from a file:// url. The ServiceRegistry also allows for runtime modularity. I.e., services can be added and removed at runtime and Strut will update to reflect the current set of features & services that are isntalled. Try to keep in mind the fact that services won't necessarily be present or if they are present they might go away. This approach allows the user to add and remove plugins from 3rd parties at runtime.

This plugin will take a list of figure elements containing an image and a figcaption element and automagically insert navigation and color the figcaption background color and the navigation according to the main color found in the current image in the slider/carousel. Demo Author: Creative Punch Installation You can get this plugin either through the repository, or with Bower bower install adaptiveslider  Usage First, be sure to add rgbaster.js and jQuery to your project. Next, make sure you have a list of images, with a figure element inside of the list item and a figcaption containing a description.   <ul class=""adaptive-slider"">         <!-- Slider Item -->     <li>       <figure>         <img src=""images/4.jpg"">         <figcaption>           <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>           <p>             Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.           </p>         </figcaption>       </figure>     </li>     <!-- End Slider Item -->     ...   </ul> Now you can simply initialize the slider with the following JavaScript: $(function() {     $('.adaptive-slider').adaptiveSlider({         opacity: 0.7,         normalizedTextColors: {             light: '#f1f1f1',             dark: '#222'         }     }); }); Both of the options are optional. Let's go over them! Options opacity: This will allow you to set the opacity of the figcaption. This defaults to 1 (full opacity) normalizedTextColors: An array. This allows you to configure what color the light text (on a dark background) should have, and vice versa. Contributing Feel free to contribute by forking this project and sending me a pull request!

No dependencies required. Tested on Chrome 26.0, Firefox 20.0, Safari 5.1.7, IE 10, Opera 16.0. Limited support for IE8/9. Check out the demo here. Features Add as many Slidr's as you want - even place them within each other. Dynamic resizing - adapts to the size of its content, unless you don't want it to. Keyboard navigation - move your cursor on top of a Slidr, and hit the arrow keys! Touch navigation (mobile) - change slides by swiping left, right, up or down! Instructions Include either slidr.js or slidr.min.js somewhere at the bottom of your html page, after the body content. <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/path/to/slidr.min.js""></script> HTML slidr.js works on any inline, inline-block or block elements with an id defined. Valid slides include any first-level children elements with the data-slidr attribute set to some unique value within the parent scope. For example: <ul id=""slidr-ul"" style=""display: inline"">   <li data-slidr=""one"">apple</li>   <li data-slidr=""two"">banana</li>   <li data-slidr=""three"">coconut</li> </ul>  <div id=""slidr-img"" style=""display: inline-block"">   <img data-slidr=""one"" src=""/static/images/apple.png""/>   <img data-slidr=""two"" src=""/static/images/banana.png""/>   <img data-slidr=""three"" src=""/static/images/coconut.png""/> </div>  <div id=""slidr-div"" style=""dislay: block"">   <div data-slidr=""one"">apple</div>   <div data-slidr=""two"">banana</div>   <div data-slidr=""three"">coconut</div> </div> are all valid html markup for creating three different Slidr's within the same page. (inline elements are transformed into inline-blocks in order to apply transitions). Javascript A global slidr object is available for calling. The most minimal way of creating a slidr is this: slidr.create('slidr-id').start(); create() accepts an optional settings parameter as its second argument. A call with all the settings toggled looks like so: slidr.create('slidr-id', {   after: function(e) { console.log('in: ' + e.in.slidr); },   before: function(e) { console.log('out: ' + e.out.slidr); },   breadcrumbs: true,   controls: 'corner',   direction: 'vertical',   fade: false,   keyboard: true,   overflow: true,   theme: '#222',   timing: { 'cube': '0.5s ease-in' },   touch: true,   transition: 'cube' }).start(); Settings Full details on available settings listed below: Parameter Type Default Description after function no-op Callback function after a slide transition finishes. before function no-op Callback function before a slide transition begins. breadcrumbs bool false Show or hide breadcrumbs on start(). true or false. controls string border Show or hide control arrows on start(). border, corner or none. direction string horizontal The default direction for new slides. horizontal or h, vertical or v. fade bool true Whether slide transitions should fade in/out. true or false. keyboard bool false Whether to enable keyboard navigation upon mouseover. true or false. overflow bool false Whether to overflow transitions at slidr borders. true or false. pause bool false Whether to pause on mouseover when running in auto(). true or false. theme string #fff Sets color theme for breadcrumbs/controls. #hexcode or rgba(value). timing object {} Custom animation timings to apply. {'transition': 'timing'}. touch bool false Whether to enable touch navigation for mobile devices. true or false. transition string linear The default transition to apply. cube, linear, fade, or none. The before and after callback functions return the following metadata: {   id: ""slidr-id"",   in: {     el: #<HTMLElement>,     slidr: ""data-slidr-in"",     trans: ""transition-in"",     dir: ""direction-in""   },   out: {     el: #<HTMLElement>,     slidr: ""data-slidr-out"",     trans: ""transition-out"",     dir: ""direction-out""   } } Global API The global slidr namespace provides the following function calls: /**  * Current version.  * @return {string} major.minor.patch.  */  function version() {};  /**  * Available transitions.  * @return {Array} of transitions.  */  function transitions() {};  /**  * Creates and returns a Slidr.  * Calling create on the same element twice returns the already instantiated Slidr.  * @param {string} id The element id to turn into a Slidr.  * @param {Object=} opt_settings Settings to apply.  */  function create(id, opt_settings) {}; Slidr API For javascript control, you can save a reference to the Slidr object as follows: // Initialize a Slidr.  // Display breadcrumbs, overflow transitions, use cube transition. var s = slidr.create('slidr-api-demo', {   breadcrumbs: true,   overflow: true });  // Add horizontal slides with default linear transition. // The extra ""one"" allows the slidr to circle back and loop infinitely. s.add('h', ['one', 'two', 'three', 'one']);  // Add vertical slides using a cube transition. s.add('v', ['five', 'four', 'three', 'five'], 'cube');  // Now start. s.start(); Slidr functions are fully chainable (where it makes sense to do so). The following is equivalent: var s = slidr.create('slidr-api-demo', {   breadcrumbs: true,   overflow: true }).add('h', ['one', 'two', 'three', 'one'])   .add('v', ['five', 'four', 'three', 'five'], 'cube')   .start(); The full list of available functions in a Slidr object is listed below: /**  * Start the Slidr!  * Automatically finds slides to create if nothing was added prior to calling start().  * @param {string} opt_start `data-slidr` id to start on.  * @return {this}  */  function start(opt_start) {};  /**  * Check whether we can slide.  * @param {string} next a direction ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right') or a `data-slidr` id.  * @return {boolean}  */  function canSlide(next) {};  /**  * Slide!  * @param {string} next a direction ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right') or a `data-slidr` id.  * @return {this}  */  function slide(next) {};  /**  * Adds a set of slides.  * @param {string} direction `horizontal || h` or `vertical || v`.  * @param {Array} ids A list of `data-slidr` id's to add to Slidr. Slides must be direct children of the Slidr.  * @param {string=} opt_transition The transition to apply between the slides, or uses the default.  * @param {boolean=} opt_overwrite Whether to overwrite existing slide mappings/transitions if conflicts occur.  * @return {this}  */  function add(direction, ids, opt_transition, opt_overwrite) {};  /**  * Automatically advance to the next slide after a certain timeout. Calls start() if not already called.  * @param {int=} opt_msec The number of millis between each slide transition. Defaults to 5000 (5 seconds).  * @param {string=} opt_direction 'up', 'down', 'left', or 'right'. Defaults to 'right'.  * @param {string=} opt_start The `data-slidr` id to start at (only works if auto is called to start the Slidr).  * @return {this}  */  function auto(opt_msec, opt_direction, opt_start) {};  /**  * Stop auto transition if it's turned on.  * @return {this}  */  function stop() {};  /**  * Set custom animation timings.  * @param {string|Object} transition Either a transition name (i.e. 'cube'), or a {'transition': 'timing'} object.  * @param {string=} opt_timing The new animation timing (i.e ""0.5s ease-in""). Not required if transition is an object.  * @return {this}  */  function timing(transition, opt_timing) {};  /**  * Toggle breadcrumbs.  * @return {this}  */  function breadcrumbs() {};  /**  * Toggle controls.  * @param {string=} opt_scheme Toggle on/off if not present, else change layout. 'border', `corner` or `none`.  * @return {this}  */  function controls(opt_scheme) {}; CSS Temporary scrollbar during transitions On some browsers, Slidr's that transition beyond the viewport might force an unwanted temporary scrollbar to appear (although this won't affect the page, the flickering can still be annoying). To fix this, add the following CSS: body {   overflow: hidden; } Dynamic resize Slidr follows a fairly straightforward heuristic for figuring out what it's width or height should be. If the width and height is explicitly set, Slidr will not resize. Otherwise, it will always adapt to the size of its content. You can also set just one and it'll dynamic resize the other. If min-width and min-height is defined, Slidr will only resize if the content exceeds those bounds. Dynamically resizing (no width/height set): <div id=""slidr-inline-dynamic"" style=""display: inline"">   <div data-slidr=""one"">good</div>   <div data-slidr=""two"">gorgeous</div>   <div data-slidr=""three"">unbelievable</div> </div> Static sizing (width and height set): <div id=""slidr-inline-static"" style=""display: inline; width: 155px; height: 30px"">   <div data-slidr=""one"">good</div>   <div data-slidr=""two"">gorgeous</div>   <div data-slidr=""three"">unbelievable</div> </div> Slidr controllers Slidr controllers are marked up like so: <aside id=""{slidr-id}-control"">   <div class=""slidr-control up""></div>   <div class=""slidr-control down""></div>   <div class=""slidr-control left""></div>   <div class=""slidr-control right""></div> </aside> You can customize the look of Slidr controls through CSS selectors like below: // Customizing a specific controller arrow. aside[id=""{slidr-id}-control""] .slidr-control.right {   width: 50px !important;   height: 50px !important;   top: 50% !important;   margin-top: -25px !important;   right: -25px !important;   border-radius: 25px;   background: url('/static/images/arrow_right.png') 14px 13px no-repeat black;   opacity: 0.4; }  aside[id=""{slidr-id}-control""] .slidr-control.right:hover {   opacity: 1; } Note: controller arrows make use of the :after psuedo element. To hide the default triangular arrow, use the following CSS: // Hide a single arrow within a single controller. aside[id=""{slidr-id}-control""] .slidr-control.right:after {   border-color: transparent !important; }  // Hide all arrows within a single controller. aside[id=""{slidr-id}-control""] .slidr-control:after {   border-color: transparent !important; }  // Hide all Slidr arrows. aside[id*=""-control""] .slidr-control:after {   border-color: transparent !important;    } Slidr breadcrumbs Slidr breadcrumbs have a similar HTML markup. Each ul denotes an entire row, while each li denotes an individual breadcrumb: <aside id=""{slidr-id}-breadcrumbs"">   <ul class=""slidr-breadcrumbs"">     <li></li>     <li class=""normal""></li>     <li class=""normal active""></li>   </ul>   ... </aside> Thus you can configure them like so: // Customize the position, size, border color and background color. aside[id=""{slidr-id}-breadcrumbs""] {   right: 50% !important;   margin-right: -41px !important; }  aside[id=""{slidr-id}-breadcrumbs""] .slidr-breadcrumbs li {   width: 15px !important;   height: 15px !important;   margin: 3px !important; }  aside[id=""{slidr-id}-breadcrumbs""] .slidr-breadcrumbs li.normal {   border-color: white !important; }  aside[id=""{slidr-id}-breadcrumbs""] .slidr-breadcrumbs li.active {   background-color: black !important; } In the worst case, feel free to create your own controllers and access via the Slidr API instead!

It features cross-browser support, a wide range of options and support for a bunch of touch devices. It has been tested on Android phones, iPhone & iPad, Windows phone and touch-screen laptops and tablets and desktops. All modern browsers and IE8+ are supported. The end result? A lean, extendible and bloat-less plugin that'll just do its job. The best part? noUiSlider has no dependencies! As of version 8, jQuery is no longer required! Oh, and the licensing terms are simple: just Do What the Fuck You Want with it. Documentation An extensive documentation, including examples, options and configuration details, is available here: noUiSlider documentation. Changelog 8.5.1 (latest) Fix: class mixup in 8.5.0 merge Change: position pips markers relatively 8.5.0 Added: ability to completely override the classes used by the slider Fix: removed invalid stopPropagation loop Fix: source properly lints 8.4.0 Fix: don't assume window exists. #503, #533, #617 and #628 Fix: :focus style applied to wrong element. #631 Fix: step option is lost on updating. #619 Fix: exposed options should be the original options, not the parsed set. #607 Added: handle animation time configurable. #629 Added: slider values can be updated without firing set. #602 Change: internal value calculations no longer limited to 7 decimals. #614 8.3.0 Expose several internal features, including options and pips. Add a fifth argument to all events, containing the handle offsets. Fixed margin: 0 throwing an error. Fixed set firing when calling slider.noUiSlider.set with a null value. Fix and clarify some examples 8.2.1 Fixed #568 and #569 8.2.0 Added 'start', 'end' and 'hover' events Added better tooltip formatting options Bugfixes, including an issue where a mouseup would be missed 8.1.0 Fixed Microsoft Edge support Merged several pull requests containing bug fixes Fixed an issue where a slider handle could get 'stuck' to a mouse cursor after moving out of a window. Combed through code using a profiler, fixed some performance issues. Added support for basic tooltips. 8.0.0 Removed jQuery dependency! For more info and other changes, see the release information. Devices Devices/browsers tested: Surface Pro 3 (Windows 10) iPad Air 2 (iOS 9.0) iPad 3 (iOS 8.4) Moto E (Android 5.1, Chrome) Lumia 930 (WP8.1, IE10 mobile) Asus S400C (Windows 10, Touch + mouse) Chrome Firefox Edge IE11 IE10 (Emulated) IE9 (Emulated) Bower Bower users can install all compiled and minified files easily using bower install nouislider --save. Supporting bower unfortunately means keeping all compiled and minified versions in the repository. Browserify This library is UMD compatible, so you can use it in this way: var noUiSlider = require('nouislider');  var slider = document.getElementById('slider');  noUiSlider.create(slider, {   start: 40,   connect: ""lower"",   range: {     min: 0,     max: 100   } }); Browser support All major browsers are supported. To support IE8 you'll need to shim several ES5 features. You can use polyfill.io to easily do so: <meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=Edge""> <!--[if lte IE 8]> <script src=""https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js""></script> <![endif]--> Version numbering Version numbering follows the 'Semantic versioning' style. You'll find an excellent documentation at Semver.org. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc. Terms Privacy Security Status Help Something went wrong with that request.

The typeahead.js library consists of 2 components: the suggestion engine, Bloodhound, and the UI view, Typeahead. The suggestion engine is responsible for computing suggestions for a given query. The UI view is responsible for rendering suggestions and handling DOM interactions. Both components can be used separately, but when used together, they can provide a rich typeahead experience. Getting Started How you acquire typeahead.js is up to you. Preferred method: Install with Bower: $ bower install typeahead.js Other methods: Download zipball of latest release. Download the latest dist files individually: bloodhound.js (standalone suggestion engine) typeahead.jquery.js (standalone UI view) typeahead.bundle.js (bloodhound.js + typeahead.jquery.js) typeahead.bundle.min.js Note: both bloodhound.js and typeahead.jquery.js have a dependency on jQuery 1.9+. Documentation Typeahead Docs Bloodhound Docs Examples For some working examples of typeahead.js, visit the examples page. Browser Support Chrome Firefox 3.5+ Safari 4+ Internet Explorer 8+ Opera 11+ NOTE: typeahead.js is not tested on mobile browsers. Customer Support For general questions about typeahead.js, tweet at @typeahead. For technical questions, you should post a question on Stack Overflow and tag it with typeahead.js. Issues Discovered a bug? Please create an issue here on GitHub! https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/issues Versioning For transparency and insight into our release cycle, releases will be numbered with the following format: <major>.<minor>.<patch> And constructed with the following guidelines: Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch For more information on semantic versioning, please visit http://semver.org/. Testing Tests are written using Jasmine and ran with Karma. To run the test suite with PhantomJS, run $ npm test. Developers If you plan on contributing to typeahead.js, be sure to read the contributing guidelines. A good starting place for new contributors are issues labeled with entry-level. Entry-level issues tend to require minor changes and provide developers a chance to get more familiar with typeahead.js before taking on more challenging work. In order to build and test typeahead.js, you'll need to install its dev dependencies ($ npm install) and have grunt-cli installed ($ npm install -g grunt-cli). Below is an overview of the available Grunt tasks that'll be useful in development. grunt build – Builds typeahead.js from source. grunt lint – Runs source and test files through JSHint. grunt watch – Rebuilds typeahead.js whenever a source file is modified. grunt server – Serves files from the root of typeahead.js on localhost:8888. Useful for using test/playground.html for debugging/testing. grunt dev – Runs grunt watch and grunt server in parallel. Maintainers Jake Harding @JakeHarding GitHub You?

Mar 10, 2013 README.markdown Tag-it: a jQuery UI plugin Tag-it is a simple and configurable tag editing widget with autocomplete support. Homepage Demo Check the examples.html for several demos and the prototype.js file for a JavaScript prototype with all options and events. Usage First, load jQuery (v1.4 or greater), jQuery UI (v1.8 or greater), and the plugin: <script src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.2/jquery.min.js"" type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8""></script> <script src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.12/jquery-ui.min.js"" type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8""></script> <script src=""js/tag-it.js"" type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8""></script>  If you're using a custom jQuery UI build, it must contain the Core, Widget, Position, and Autocomplete components. The Effects Core with ""Blind"" and ""Highlight"" Effect components are optional, but used if available. The plugin requires either a jQuery UI theme or a Tag-it theme to be present, as well as its own included base CSS file (jquery.tagit.css). Here we use the Flick theme as an example: <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/flick/jquery-ui.css""> <link href=""css/jquery.tagit.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"">  Now, let's attach it to an existing <ul> box: <script type=""text/javascript"">     $(document).ready(function() {         $(""#myTags"").tagit();     }); </script>  <ul id=""myTags"">     <!-- Existing list items will be pre-added to the tags -->     <li>Tag1</li>     <li>Tag2</li> </ul>  This will turn the list into a tag-it widget. There are several other possible configurations and ways to instantiate the widget, including one that uses a single comma-delimited input field rather than one per tag, so see the Options documentation below as well as the examples page (and its source) which demonstrates most of them, as well as the Tag-it Zendesk theme used in the screenshot above. Theming Tag-it is as easily themeable as any jQuery UI widget, using your own theme made with Themeroller, or one of the jQuery UI premade themes. The old ZenDesk-like theme is included as an optional CSS file (tagit.ui-zendesk.css). Options Tag-it accepts several options to customize its behaviour: fieldName (String) Each tag's hidden input field will have this name. If you're using PHP, you may want to use something like itemName[fieldName][] for this option's value. $(""#myTags"").tagit({     fieldName: ""skills"" });  Defaults to tags. availableTags (Array) Used as source for the autocompletion, unless autocomplete.source is overridden. $(""#myTags"").tagit({     availableTags: [""c++"", ""java"", ""php"", ""javascript"", ""ruby"", ""python"", ""c""] });  If you define your own autocomplete.source, this option is unused (unless you choose to reference it yourself from your custom autocomplete.source of course.) Defaults to an empty array []. autocomplete (Object) Allows overriding the source and select options that are set by default, as well as adding any other options you want to pass to the jQuery UI Autocomplete widget, such as minLength or delay. The autocomplete.source should be overridden if you want to use custom autocompletion sources, like an Ajax / XHR response. For example: $(""#myTags"").tagit({     autocomplete: {delay: 0, minLength: 2} });  The default autocomplete.source function filters the strings in availableTags and subtracts the already assigned tags. It also positions autocomplete underneath tag input. See the full list of available options here. showAutocompleteOnFocus (boolean) Shows autocomplete when the tag input first receives focus, before the user even types anything. If enabled, this will also make autocomplete.minLength default to 0 unless you override that, so that autocomplete can show up with a blank search. Defaults to false. removeConfirmation (boolean) When removeConfirmation is enabled the user has to press the backspace key twice to remove the last tag. After the first keypress the last tag receives a remove css class which can be used to visually highlight the tag. Defaults to false. caseSensitive (boolean) whether the duplication check should do a case sensitive check or not. Defaults to true. allowDuplicates (boolean) Allows duplicate tags to be created. One implication of this is that removeTagByLabel will remove all tags which match the given label. Defaults to false. allowSpaces (boolean) When allowSpaces is enabled the user is not required to wrap multi-word tags in quotation marks. For example, the user can enter John Smith instead of ""John Smith"". Defaults to false. readOnly (boolean) When enabled, tag-it just render tags. It disables the ability to edit tags. Defaults to false. tagLimit (integer) Limits the total number of tags that can be entered at once. Note that if you use this option with preloaded data, it may truncate the number of preloaded tags. Set to null for unlimited tags. See the onTagLimitExceeded callback for customizing this behavior. Defaults to null. singleField (boolean) When enabled, will use a single hidden field for the form, rather than one per tag. It will delimit tags in the field with singleFieldDelimiter. Defaults to false, unless Tag-it was created on an input element, in which case singleField will be overridden as true. singleFieldDelimiter (String) Defaults to "","" singleFieldNode (DomNode) Set this to an input DOM node to use an existing form field. Any text in it will be erased on init. But it will be populated with the text of tags as they are created, delimited by singleFieldDelimiter. If this is not set, we create an input node for it, with the name given in fieldName. Defaults to null, unless Tag-it was created on an input element, in which case singleFieldNode will be overridden with that element. tabIndex (integer) Optionally set a tabindex attribute on the input that gets created for tag-it user input. Defaults to null placeholderText (String) Optionally set a placeholder attribute on the input that gets created for tag-it user input. Defaults to null Events beforeTagAdded (function, Callback) Can be used to add custom behaviour before the tag is added to the DOM. The function receives a null event, and an object containing the properties tag, tagLabel, and duringInitialization. duringInitialization is a boolean indicating whether the tag was added during the initial construction of this widget, e.g. when initializing tag-it on an input with preloaded data. You can use this to tell whether the event was initiated by the user or by the widget's initialization. To cancel a tag from being added, simply return false in your event callback to bail out from adding the tag and stop propagation of the event. $(""#myTags"").tagit({     beforeTagAdded: function(event, ui) {         // do something special         console.log(ui.tag);     } });  afterTagAdded (function, Callback) Behaves the same as beforeTagAdded except that it fires after the tag has been added to the DOM. It too receives the duringInitialization parameter — see beforeTagAdded for details. beforeTagRemoved (function, Callback) Can be used to add custom behaviour before the tag is removed from the DOM. To cancel a tag from being removed, simply return false in your event callback to bail out from removing the tag and stop propagation of the event. The function receives a null event, and an object with tag and tagLabel properties. $(""#myTags"").tagit({     beforeTagRemoved: function(event, ui) {         // do something special         console.log(ui.tag);     } });  afterTagRemoved (function, Callback) Behaves the same as beforeTagRemoved except that it fires after the tag has been removed from the DOM. onTagExists (function, Callback) Triggered when attempting to add a tag that has already been added in the widget. The callback receives a null event, and an object containing the properties existingTag and duringInitialization, since technically you could try to preload duplicate tags during the widget initialization. If the allowDuplicates option is enabled, this will not be triggered. By default it will visually highlight the existing tag, unless you return false in your callback. onTagClicked (function, Callback) Can be used to add custom behaviour when the tag is clicked. The function receives the click event and an objecting containing tag and tagLabel properties. $(""#myTags"").tagit({     onTagClicked: function(event, ui) {         // do something special         console.log(ui.tag);     } });  onTagLimitExceeded (function, Callback) Called when attempting to create a tag while the tag limit has already been reached. Receives a null event, and an object with the property duringInitialization. This can only be called if tagLimit is set. Methods assignedTags() Returns an array of the text values of all the tags currently in the widget. $(""#myTags"").tagit(""assignedTags"");  createTag(tagLabel, additionalClass) Adds new tag to the list. The additionalClass parameter is an optional way to add classes to the tag element. $(""#myTags"").tagit(""createTag"", ""brand-new-tag"");  preprocessTag(function, Callback) Set a function to be called before tag is created. Callback receives the value of the tag created. // ensure all tags are capitalized $(#tag-it"").tagit(""preprocessTag"", function(val) {   if (!val) { return ''; }   return val[0].toUpperCase() + val.slice(1, val.length); }); // foo -> Foo  removeTagByLabel(tagLabel, animate) Finds the tag with the label tagLabel and removes it. If no such tag is found, it'll throw an exception. $(""#myTags"").tagit(""removeTagByLabel"", ""my-tag"");  removeAll() Clears the widget of all tags — removes each tag it contains, so the beforeTagRemoved / afterTagRemoved event callbacks (if set) will be called for each. $(""#myTags"").tagit(""removeAll"");  Properties tagInput The <input> field which is used for entering new tags. It's a jQuery object, so you may use it to add a class or anything to it, e.g.: $(""#myTags"").data(""ui-tagit"").tagInput.addClass(""fancy"");  Authors Levy Carneiro Jr. original author Martin Rehfeld Tobias Schmidt Skylar Challand Alex Ehlke current maintainer License tag-it is released under the MIT license.

Placeholder attributes are valid on input elements of various types and textarea elements. Placeholders.js is licensed under the MIT License. See the unminified file for the full license text. Get it! The polyfill is available through Bower: bower install placeholders  Alternatively, you can download the polyfill and get a whole load of information and instructions at our website. If you're using Ruby on Rails, you can also try out our gem. Supported Browsers Placeholders.js aims to support the widest range of browsers possible. The idea is that you will be able to use the native placeholder attribute along with Placeholders.js and your users on any platform will get the same experience. This table will be updated as and when further browsers are tested. Mobile browser testing is a big one that's high on the list. Currently tested and working in the following browsers on (where applicable) both Windows 7 and CentOS 6: Internet Explorer 6 - 9 (with Placeholders.js) Firefox 1 - 3 (with Placeholders.js), 4+ (native) Opera 7 - 10 (with Placeholders.js), 11+ (native) Safari 3.2 (with Placeholders.js), 4+ (native) Chrome 4+ (native) Flock 1.0+ (with Placeholders.js) Konqueror 4.3 (with Placeholders.js) SeaMonkey 1+ (with Placeholders.js) Maxthon 1+ (with Placeholders.js) SlimBrowser 5 (with Placeholders.js) K-Meleon 0.7+ (with Placeholders.js) Do you use some obscure browser that doesn't have native placeholder attribute support? If so, please let me know so I can make sure Placeholders.js works with it. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

This plugin will turn your boring tag list into a magical input that turns each tag into a style-able object with its own delete link. The plugin handles all the data - your form just sees a comma-delimited list of tags! Get it from Github View Demo Test it yourself using this jsFiddle Demo Created by XOXCO Instructions First, add the Javascript and CSS files to your tag: <script src=""jquery.tagsinput.js""></script> <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""jquery.tagsinput.css"" />  Create a real input in your form that will contain a comma-separated list of tags. You can put any default or existing tags in the value attribute, and they'll be handled properly. <input name=""tags"" id=""tags"" value=""foo,bar,baz"" />  Then, simply call the tagsInput function on any field that should be treated as a list of tags. $('#tags').tagsInput();  If you want to use jQuery.autocomplete, you can pass in a parameter with the autocomplete url. $('#tags').tagsInput({   autocomplete_url:'http://myserver.com/api/autocomplete' });  If you're using the bassistance jQuery.autocomplete, which takes extra parameters, you can also send in options to the autocomplete plugin, as described here. $('#tags').tagsInput({   autocomplete_url:'http://myserver.com/api/autocomplete',   autocomplete:{selectFirst:true,width:'100px',autoFill:true} });  You can add and remove tags by calling the addTag() and removeTag() functions. $('#tags').addTag('foo'); $('#tags').removeTag('bar');  You can import a list of tags using the importTags() function... $('#tags').importTags('foo,bar,baz');  You can also use importTags() to reset the tag list... $('#tags').importTags('');  And you can check if a tag exists using tagExist()... if ($('#tags').tagExist('foo')) { ... }  If additional functionality is required when a tag is added or removed, you may specify callback functions via the onAddTag and onRemoveTag parameters. Both functions should accept a single tag as the parameter. If you do not want to provide a way to add tags, or you would prefer to provide an alternate interface for adding tags to the box, you may pass an false into the optional 'interactive' parameter. The tags will still be rendered as per usual, and the addTag and removeTag functions will operate as expected. If you want a function to be called every time a tag is updated/deleted, set it as the 'onChange' option. By default, if the cursor is immediately after a tag, hitting backspace will delete that tag. If you want to override this, set the 'removeWithBackspace' option to false. Options $(selector).tagsInput({    'autocomplete_url': url_to_autocomplete_api,    'autocomplete': { option: value, option: value},    'height':'100px',    'width':'300px',    'interactive':true,    'defaultText':'add a tag',    'onAddTag':callback_function,    'onRemoveTag':callback_function,    'onChange' : callback_function,    'delimiter': [',',';'],   // Or a string with a single delimiter. Ex: ';'    'removeWithBackspace' : true,    'minChars' : 0,    'maxChars' : 0, // if not provided there is no limit    'placeholderColor' : '#666666' });  Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Now you can use a simple and pure javascript lib to mask your input elements, without need to load jQuery or Zepto to do it. Let's live a lightweight client-side world using micro libraries as VanillaMasker is! Don't worry about where this will work, because this is a cross-browser and cross-device library. And if you find any bug, please let us know about it reporting an issue. If you wanna see how this lib works, click to test this demo page. How to install Download script development version (6.2 Kbytes); minified version (3.24 Kbytes); gzipped version (1.3 Kbytes); We have the following CDN available, for development or minified versions: //cdn.jsdelivr.net/vanilla-masker/1.1.0/vanilla-masker.js //cdn.jsdelivr.net/vanilla-masker/1.1.0/vanilla-masker.min.js We intent to automatically send new versions to the CDN, but keep in mind that the version you want might not be available there. Of course you can always download and put it in your own site. NPM For npm users you just run this command: npm install vanilla-masker --save Bower You can install it via bower too, using this command: bower install --save vanilla-masker Meteor And you can install inside your meteor projects with this command: meteor add bankfacil:vanilla-masker How to use Loading the lib Like I said, you need to download and put this lib in your own site, using this tag below: <html>    <head></head>    <body>       <input type=""text"">       <!-- Loading the vanilla-masker lib -->       <script src=""vanilla-masker.min.js""></script>    </body> </html> Common uses Money format // Masking input element to money.

Dynamic mask Sometimes you need swap the mask according with value. You can see the sample below on codepen.io function inputHandler(masks, max, event) {   var c = event.target;   var v = c.value.replace(/\D/g, '');   var m = c.value.length > max ? 1 : 0;   VMasker(c).unMask();   VMasker(c).maskPattern(masks[m]);   c.value = VMasker.toPattern(v, masks[m]); }  var telMask = ['(99) 9999-99999', '(99) 99999-9999']; var tel = document.querySelector('#tel'); VMasker(tel).maskPattern(telMask[0]); tel.addEventListener('input', inputHandler.bind(undefined, telMask, 14), false);  var docMask = ['999.999.999-999', '99.999.999/9999-99']; var doc = document.querySelector('#doc'); VMasker(doc).maskPattern(docMask[0]); doc.addEventListener('input', inputHandler.bind(undefined, docMask, 14), false); Meteor uses If your app is built on top of Meteor framework, you can use the lib in this way... <body>   <h1>Welcome to Meteor!</h1>   {{> myTemplate}} </body>  <template name=""myTemplate"">   <input type=""text"" placeholder=""Money"" data-vm-mask-money>   <input type=""text"" placeholder=""Number"" data-vm-mask-number>   <input type=""text"" placeholder=""Date"" data-vm-mask-date> </template>  You just need to bind the elements into the template rendered function... if (Meteor.isClient) {   Template.myTemplate.rendered = function() {     VMasker(this.find(""[data-vm-mask-money]"")).maskMoney();     VMasker(this.find(""[data-vm-mask-number]"")).maskNumber();     VMasker(this.find(""[data-vm-mask-date]"")).maskPattern(""99/99/9999"");   }; } How to run localhost Install node.js - http://nodejs.org/download Clone this repository - git clone git@github.com:BankFacil/vanilla-masker.git Install Grunt - npm install -g grunt-cli Install Grunt dependencies - cd vanilla-masker && npm install Running development mode - grunt dev Open the browser - http://localhost:4500 Run test Run the command: grunt test Build project Run the command: grunt build TODO - we need pull requests :] Test Opera mini browser; Beautify Demo Page; Bind mask using data-vm attributes; Compatibility Desktop browsers: Chrome 4.0+ Firefox 2.0+ Safari 4.0+ Opera 10.0+ Internet Explorer 8+ Mobile browsers: Android browser 2.2+ Chrome mobile 35.0+ Firefox mobile 29.0+ Opera mobile 10.0+ iOS Safari 3.2+ Windows Phone browsers Contributors Caio Ribeiro Pereira - caio.ribeiro.pereira@gmail.com Leandro Alvares da Costa - leandroadacosta@gmail.com Bobby - squidz.bee@gmail.com Henrique Antonini Silvério - contato@henriquesilverio.com Joilson Marques - joilsonmarques@gmail.com Leonardo Andrade - leonardopandrade@gmail.com Thiago Lagden - lagden@gmail.com Changelog 1.1.0 - 13/08/2015 Improved demo page layout - See this pull request Fixed bower.json - See this pull request When backspace is pressed the pattern is kept - See this pull request Enabled sauce-labs on Travis - See this pull request 1.0.9 - 07/04/2015 Added optional placeholder feature for patterns - See this pull request 1.0.8 - 27/01/2015 Bug fix #29 - See this pull request 1.0.7 - 26/01/2015 Bug fix #28 - See this issue 1.0.6 - 19/12/2014 Bug fix #26 - See this pull request Bug fix #24 - See this pull request 1.0.5 - 06/12/2014 Bug fix - See this pull request 1.0.4 - 02/12/2014 Added unbindElementToMask() function.

Basic Usage Before you try anything, you need to include awesomplete.css and awesomplete.js in your page, via the usual tags: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""awesomplete.css"" /> <script src=""awesomplete.js"" async></script> Then you can add an Awesomplete widget by adding the following input tag: <input class=""awesomplete""        data-list=""Ada, Java, JavaScript, Brainfuck, LOLCODE, Node.js, Ruby on Rails"" /> Add class=""awesomplete"" for it to be automatically processed (you can still specify many options via HTML attributes) Otherwise you can instantiate with a few lines of JS code, which allow for more customization. There are many ways to link an input to a list of suggestions. The simple example above could have also been made with the following markup, which provides a nice native fallback in case the script doesn’t load: <input class=""awesomplete"" list=""mylist"" /> <datalist id=""mylist"">     <option>Ada</option>     <option>Java</option>     <option>JavaScript</option>     <option>Brainfuck</option>     <option>LOLCODE</option>     <option>Node.js</option>     <option>Ruby on Rails</option> </datalist> Or the following, if you don’t want to use a <datalist>, or if you don’t want to use IDs (since any selector will work in data-list): <input class=""awesomplete"" data-list=""#mylist"" /> <ul id=""mylist"">     <li>Ada</li>     <li>Java</li>     <li>JavaScript</li>     <li>Brainfuck</li>     <li>LOLCODE</li>     <li>Node.js</li>     <li>Ruby on Rails</li> </ul> There are multiple customizations and properties able to be instantiated within the JS.

As it stands, there are quite a few issues are that ready to be resolved and merged, but I would like help from someone in championing it forward. If it sounds like you are up to the challenge, shoot met an email at reach@amsul.ca with a link to your Github account 🙏. Library files The lib folder includes the library files with a compressed folder containing the minified counter-parts. These files are minified using Grunt. Pickers There are three picker files: picker.js The core file (required before any other picker) picker.date.js The date picker picker.time.js The time picker To support old browsers, namely IE8, also include the legacy.js file. Themes All themes are generated using LESS and compiled from the lib/themes-source folder into the lib/themes folder. There are two themes: default.css The default modal-style theme classic.css The classic dropdown-style theme Based on the theme, pick the relevant picker styles: default.date.css and default.time.css when using the default theme classic.date.css and classic.time.css when using the classic theme ** For languages with text flowing from right-to-left, also include the rtl.css stylesheet. Translations The translations live in the lib/translations folder. There are currently 43 language translations included. Building with Grunt Grunt ~0.4.5 is used to build the project files. To get started, clone the project and then run: npm install to get the required node modules. grunt test --verbose to confirm you have all the dependencies. Type out grunt --help to see a list of all the tasks available. The generally used tasks are: grunt develop compiles the LESS files and watches for any source changes. grunt package compiles and then minifies the source files. grunt test tests the entire package. Styling with LESS The picker themes are built using LESS with Grunt. To customize the CSS output, read the _variables.less file in the lib/themes-source folder. You can specify: colors for the theme, sizes for the picker, media-query breakpoints, and a whole bunch of other stuff. Make sure to run the grunt develop task before making any changes to compile it into CSS. Versioning To maintain consistency in the sort of changes to expect with version bumps, Semantic Versioning guidelines is followed as closely as possible: <major>.<minor>.<patch> Constructed as such: major: breaks backward compatibility (resets the minor and patch) minor: new additions with backward compatibility (resets the patch) patch: bug fixes and misc changes If a version bump is due, make sure to update the version with a project-wide search and replace. Bugs Before opening a new issue, please search the existing Issues for anything similar – there might already be an answer to your problem. You might also wanna check out the Contributing guide. Contributing Before contributing any code to the project, please take a look at the Contributing guide. If there’s anything you’d like to discuss, we like to hang out on Gitter.

Since version 1.0.0 Pikaday is stable and used in production. If you do however find bugs or have feature requests please submit them to the GitHub issue tracker. Also see the changelog Usage Pikaday can be bound to an input field: <input type=""text"" id=""datepicker""> Add the JavaScript to the end of your document: <script src=""pikaday.js""></script> <script>     var picker = new Pikaday({ field: document.getElementById('datepicker') }); </script> If you're using jQuery make sure to pass only the first element: var picker = new Pikaday({ field: $('#datepicker')[0] }); If the Pikaday instance is not bound to a field you can append the element anywhere: var field = document.getElementById('datepicker'); var picker = new Pikaday({     onSelect: function(date) {         field.value = picker.toString();     } }); field.parentNode.insertBefore(picker.el, field.nextSibling); For advanced formatting load Moment.js prior to Pikaday: See the moment.js example for a full version. <input type=""text"" id=""datepicker"" value=""9 Oct 2014"">  <script src=""moment.js""></script> <script src=""pikaday.js""></script> <script>     var picker = new Pikaday({         field: document.getElementById('datepicker'),         format: 'D MMM YYYY',         onSelect: function() {             console.log(this.getMoment().format('Do MMMM YYYY'));         }     }); </script> Configuration As the examples demonstrate above Pikaday has many useful options: field bind the datepicker to a form field trigger use a different element to trigger opening the datepicker, see trigger example (default to field) bound automatically show/hide the datepicker on field focus (default true if field is set) position preferred position of the datepicker relative to the form field, e.g.: top right, bottom right Note: automatic adjustment may occur to avoid datepicker from being displayed outside the viewport, see positions example (default to 'bottom left') reposition can be set to false to not reposition datepicker within the viewport, forcing it to take the configured position (default: true) container DOM node to render calendar into, see container example (default: undefined) format the default output format for .toString() and field value (requires Moment.js for custom formatting) formatStrict the default flag for moment's strict date parsing (requires Moment.js for custom formatting) defaultDate the initial date to view when first opened setDefaultDate make the defaultDate the initial selected value firstDay first day of the week (0: Sunday, 1: Monday, etc) minDate the minimum/earliest date that can be selected (this should be a native Date object - e.g. new Date() or moment().toDate()) maxDate the maximum/latest date that can be selected (this should be a native Date object - e.g. new Date() or moment().toDate()) disableWeekends disallow selection of Saturdays or Sundays disableDayFn callback function that gets passed a Date object for each day in view. Should return true to disable selection of that day. yearRange number of years either side (e.g. 10) or array of upper/lower range (e.g. [1900,2015]) showWeekNumber show the ISO week number at the head of the row (default false) isRTL reverse the calendar for right-to-left languages i18n language defaults for month and weekday names (see internationalization below) yearSuffix additional text to append to the year in the title showMonthAfterYear render the month after year in the title (default false) showDaysInNextAndPreviousMonths render days of the calendar grid that fall in the next or previous months to the current month instead of rendering an empty table cell (default: false) numberOfMonths number of visible calendars mainCalendar when numberOfMonths is used, this will help you to choose where the main calendar will be (default left, can be set to right). Only used for the first display or when a selected date is not already visible theme define a classname that can be used as a hook for styling different themes, see theme example (default null) onSelect callback function for when a date is selected onOpen callback function for when the picker becomes visible onClose callback function for when the picker is hidden onDraw callback function for when the picker draws a new month jQuery Plugin The normal version of Pikaday does not require jQuery, however there is a jQuery plugin if that floats your boat (see plugins/pikaday.jquery.js in the repository). This version requires jQuery, naturally, and can be used like other plugins: See the jQuery example for a full version. <script src=""//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js""></script> <script src=""pikaday.js""></script> <script src=""plugins/pikaday.jquery.js""></script> <script>  // activate datepickers for all elements with a class of `datepicker` $('.datepicker').pikaday({ firstDay: 1 });  // chain a few methods for the first datepicker, jQuery style! $('.datepicker').eq(0).pikaday('show').pikaday('gotoYear', 2042);  </script> AMD support If you use a modular script loader than Pikaday is not bound to the global object and will fit nicely in your build process. You can require Pikaday just like any other module. See the AMD example for a full version. require(['pikaday'], function(Pikaday) {     var picker = new Pikaday({ field: document.getElementById('datepicker') }); }); The same applies for the jQuery plugin mentioned above. See the jQuery AMD example for a full version. require(['jquery', 'pikaday.jquery'], function($) {     $('#datepicker').pikaday(); }); CommonJS module support If you use a CommonJS compatible environment you can use the require function to import Pikaday. var pikaday = require('pikaday'); When you bundle all your required modules with Browserify and you don't use Moment.js specify the ignore option: browserify main.js -o bundle.js -i moment Ruby on Rails If you're using Ruby on Rails, make sure to check out the Pikaday gem. Methods You can control the date picker after creation: var picker = new Pikaday({ field: document.getElementById('datepicker') }); Get and set date picker.toString('YYYY-MM-DD') Returns the selected date in a string format. If Moment.js exists (recommended) then Pikaday can return any format that Moment understands, otherwise you're stuck with JavaScript's default. picker.getDate() Returns a basic JavaScript Date object of the selected day, or null if no selection. picker.setDate('2015-01-01') Set the current selection. This will be restricted within the bounds of minDate and maxDate options if they're specified. You can optionally pass a boolean as the second parameter to prevent triggering of the onSelect callback (true), allowing the date to be set silently. picker.getMoment() Returns a Moment.js object for the selected date (Moment must be loaded before Pikaday). picker.setMoment(moment('14th February 2014', 'DDo MMMM YYYY')) Set the current selection with a Moment.js object (see setDate for details). Change current view picker.gotoDate(new Date(2014, 1)) Change the current view to see a specific date. This example will jump to February 2014 (month is a zero-based index). picker.gotoToday() Shortcut for picker.gotoDate(new Date()) picker.gotoMonth(2) Change the current view by month (0: January, 1: Februrary, etc). picker.nextMonth() picker.prevMonth() Go to the next or previous month (this will change year if necessary). picker.gotoYear() Change the year being viewed. picker.setMinDate() Update the minimum/earliest date that can be selected. picker.setMaxDate() Update the maximum/latest date that can be selected. picker.setStartRange() Update the range start date. For using two Pikaday instances to select a date range. picker.setEndRange() Update the range end date. For using two Pikaday instances to select a date range. Show and hide datepicker picker.isVisible() Returns true or false. picker.show() Make the picker visible. picker.adjustPosition() Recalculate and change the position of the picker. picker.hide() Hide the picker making it invisible. picker.destroy() Hide the picker and remove all event listeners — no going back! Internationalization The default i18n configuration format looks like this: i18n: {     previousMonth : 'Previous Month',     nextMonth     : 'Next Month',     months        : ['January','February','March','April','May','June','July','August','September','October','November','December'],     weekdays      : ['Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday'],     weekdaysShort : ['Sun','Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat'] } You must provide 12 months and 7 weekdays (with abbreviations). Always specify weekdays in this order with Sunday first. You can change the firstDay option to reorder if necessary (0: Sunday, 1: Monday, etc). You can also set isRTL to true for languages that are read right-to-left. Extensions Timepicker Pikaday is a pure datepicker. It will not support picking a time of day. However, there have been efforts to add time support to Pikaday. See #1 and #18. These reside in their own fork. You can use the work @owenmead did most recently at owenmead/Pikaday A more simple time selection approach done by @xeeali at xeeali/Pikaday is based on version 1.2.0.

Opt-in UI, no jQuery! Rome wasn't built in a day. Browser support includes every sane browser and IE7+. Demo! You can see a live demo here. Oh, rome synchronizes in real-time with inputs, never steals focus, and its CSS is entirely customizable! Rome depends on moment. It doesn't depend on jQuery or other weird frameworks, though. Install From npm or Bower. npm install --save rome bower install --save rome Note that if you're using the standalone version, the API is published under the rome global. If you're using CJS, then you'll have to require('rome'). Setup You can use your own distribution of moment, using rome.standalone.js. <script src='moment.js'></script> <script src='rome.standalone.js'></script> You could just use the bundled rome.js distribution, which comes with moment in it. <script src='rome.js'></script> If you need to do anything regarding internationalization, refer to moment for that. Ideally, make those changes before starting to create Rome calendar components. API The API in rome exposes a few properties. rome.find(elem) If a calendar is associated to the provided elem, then that calendar is returned, otherwise returns null. DOM elements can only have one associated calendar. rome(elem, options={}) This method creates a calendar instance and associates it to the provided elem. This association can't be undone even by .destroy()ing the rome instance, because it can be .restore()d later. Subsequent calls to rome(elem) will return the associated calendar, instead of creating a new one (see rome.find(elem)). Think of this as a ""caching feature"". Creating a calendar has a ton of options. These have reasonable defaults that are easy to adjust, too. The options are listed below. Option Description appendTo DOM element where the calendar will be appended to. Takes 'parent' as the parent element autoClose When set to true, the calendar is auto-closed when picking a day _(or a time if time: true and date: false). A value of 'time' will only auto-close the calendar when a time is picked. autoHideOnBlur Hides the calendar when focusing something other than the input field autoHideOnClick Hides the calendar when clicking away date The calendar shows days and allows you to navigate between months dateValidator Function to validate that a given date is considered valid. Receives a native Date parameter. dayFormat Format string used to display days on the calendar initialValue Value used to initialize calendar. Takes string, Date, or moment inputFormat Format string used for the input field as well as the results of rome invalidate Ensures the date is valid when the field is blurred strictParse Compares input strictly against inputFormat, and partial matches are discarded max Disallow dates past max. Takes string, Date, or moment min Disallow dates before min. Takes string, Date, or moment monthFormat Format string used by the calendar to display months and their year monthsInCalendar How many months get rendered in the calendar required Is the field required or do you allow empty values? styles CSS classes applied to elements on the calendar time The calendar shows the current time and allows you to change it using a dropdown timeFormat Format string used to display the time on the calendar timeInterval Seconds between each option in the time dropdown timeValidator Function to validate that a given time is considered valid. Receives a native Date parameter. weekdayFormat Format used to display weekdays. Takes min (Mo), short (Mon), long (Monday), or an array with seven strings of your choosing. weekStart Day considered the first of the week. Range: Sunday 0 - Saturday 6 Note that in the case of input fields, when initialValue isn't provided the initial value is inferred from elem.value instead. In the case of inline calendars, new Date() will be used as a default if none is provided. Inlining the Calendar If you pass in an element other than an input tag, then this method behaves slightly differently. The difference is that appendTo becomes the provided elem, and the calendar won't attach itself to an input element. The options listed below will be ignored. autoHideOnBlur, because there is no input field that can be tracked for blur events invalidate, because there is no input field to keep consistent with the calendar component required, because you can easily do that on an input field styles.positioned, because the calendar will be considered inlined All of the other options still apply, and identical behavior should be expected. Default Options If you don't set an option, the default will be used. You can look up the defaults here, or below. {   ""appendTo"": document.body,   ""autoClose"": true,   ""autoHideOnBlur"": true,   ""autoHideOnClick"": true,   ""date"": true,   ""dateValidator"": Function.prototype,   ""dayFormat"": ""DD"",   ""initialValue"": null,   ""inputFormat"": ""YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm"",   ""invalidate"": true,   ""max"": null,   ""min"": null,   ""monthFormat"": ""MMMM YYYY"",   ""monthsInCalendar"": 1,   ""required"": false,   ""strictParse"": false,   ""styles"": {     ""back"": ""rd-back"",     ""container"": ""rd-container"",     ""date"": ""rd-date"",     ""dayBody"": ""rd-days-body"",     ""dayBodyElem"": ""rd-day-body"",     ""dayConcealed"": ""rd-day-concealed"",     ""dayDisabled"": ""rd-day-disabled"",     ""dayHead"": ""rd-days-head"",     ""dayHeadElem"": ""rd-day-head"",     ""dayRow"": ""rd-days-row"",     ""dayTable"": ""rd-days"",     ""month"": ""rd-month"",     ""next"": ""rd-next"",     ""positioned"": ""rd-container-attachment"",     ""selectedDay"": ""rd-day-selected"",     ""selectedTime"": ""rd-time-selected"",     ""time"": ""rd-time"",     ""timeList"": ""rd-time-list"",     ""timeOption"": ""rd-time-option""   },   ""time"": true,   ""timeFormat"": ""HH:mm"",   ""timeInterval"": 1800,   ""timeValidator"": Function.prototype,   ""weekdayFormat"": ""min"",   ""weekStart"": moment().weekday(0).day() } Rome API When you create a calendar with rome(elem), you'll get a cal instance back. This has a few API methods. Most of these methods return the calendar instance whenever possible, allowing for method chaining. .show() Shows the calendar. If associated with an input, the calendar gets absolutely position right below the input field. .hide() Hides the calendar. .id Auto-generated unique identifier assigned to this instance of Rome. .container The DOM element that contains the calendar. .associated The associated DOM element assigned to this calendar instance. This is the input field or parent element that you used to create the calendar. .getDate() Returns the current date, as defined by the calendar, in a native Date object. If required: false you'll get null when the input field is empty. .getDateString(format?) Returns the current date, as defined by the calendar, using the provided options.inputFormat format string or a format of your choosing. If required: false you'll get null when the input field is empty. .getMoment() Returns a copy of the moment object underlying the current date in the calendar. If required: false you'll get null when the input field is empty. .destroy() Removes the calendar from the DOM and all of its associated DOM event listeners. The only responsive API method becomes the .restore method described below, the rest of the API becomes no-op methods. After emitting the destroyed event, all event listeners are removed from the instance. .destroyed Returns true when the calendar is in a destroyed state and false otherwise. .restore(options?) Restores the calendar, using the provided options (or the default options). The associated DOM element can't be changed. The API methods are restored to their original functionality. .options(options?) If an options object is provided, it destroys the calendar and initializes it with the provided options. Effectively the same as calling .restore(options) immediately after calling .destroy(). If no options object is provided, a copy of the current options is returned. .options.reset() Resets the options to the factory defaults. Effectively the same as calling .options({}) while preserving the appendTo option. .emitValues() Emits all of the data events listed below. Mostly used internally, should be avoided in consumer-land. .setValue(value) Sets the current date to the provided value, but only if that value is valid according to the rules defined by the calendar. Takes string, Date, or moment. Mostly used internally, and it doesn't emit any events. .refresh() Forces a refresh of the calendar. This method will redraw the month and update the dates that can be selected in accordance with dateValidator and timeValidator. .back() Steps the calendar display back by one month. Equivalent to clicking the 'back' button. Returns undefined. .next() Steps the calendar display forward by one month. Equivalent to clicking the 'next' button. Returns undefined. Events Rome calendars also provide a few events you can subscribe to. These events are published through an event emitter created using contra. These events are listed below. Event Arguments Description ready [options] The calendar has been .restored destroyed [] The calendar has been .destroyed data [value] The date may have been updated by the calendar. Value of .getDateString() is provided year [year] The year may have been updated by the calendar. Value of moment.year() is provided month [month] The month may have been updated by the calendar. Value of moment.month() is provided day [day] The day may have been updated by the calendar. Value of moment.date() is provided time [time] The time may have been updated by the calendar. Formatted time string is provided show [] The calendar has been displayed hide [] The calendar has been hidden back [month] The calendar view has been moved back a month to the value moment.month() next [month] The calendar view has been moved forward a month to the value moment.month() Date and Time Validator Please note that dateValidator and timeValidator both receive a native Date object as a parameter. These methods are expected to return undefined or true if the date is deemed valid, and false in case the date is invalid. If dateValidator returns false, the validation process will try to find a valid date near the desired date. If dateValidator passes for a given date, the timeValidator will attempt to validate that date as well. If the time is invalid, the day will be probed for a valid time. This validation starts at the desired time, and grows in timeInterval increments. When the end of the day is reached, validation resumes at the start of the day instead of leaping to the next day. rome.val There are a few default validator factories provided by Rome to make your life easier. These methods take a moment, a Date, a string that can be parsed into a moment using inputFormat, or a DOM element that Rome could use to look up another Rome instance. If you passed in a DOM element, the validator will look up the associated Rome instance and validate using its value. The first time the validator is executed on any inline calendar, the 'data' event for that calendar will be hooked to refresh the related calendar. For usage examples you can refer to the demos. rome.val.afterEq(value) Returns whether the date is after the provided value. The comparison uses >=, meaning it's inclusive. rome.val.after(value) Returns whether the date is after the provided value. The comparison uses >, meaning it's exclusive. rome.val.beforeEq(value) Returns whether the date is before the provided value. The comparison uses <=, meaning it's inclusive. rome.val.before(value) Returns whether the date is before the provided value. The comparison uses <, meaning it's exclusive. rome.val.except(left, right) Returns whether the date is any date except the provided value. You can provide a wide variety of input values. Keep in mind Date, string, moment, and the DOM element used to find another calendar are all valid input types. Providing left only means ""any date except this one"" If you use rome.val.except('2014-08-09'), then '2014-08-09' is invalid. Providing left and right means ""any date that's not in this range"" If you use rome.val.except('2014-08-09', '2014-09-01'), then anything between '2014-08-09' and '2014-09-01' is invalid. If left is an array, each element in the array is treated as the simple case described above In this case, right is completely ignored. Every item in the array is treated as follows. If the item is single, then a rule is built on that single date Using rome.val.except(['2014-08-09', '2014-09-01']) means that '2014-08-09' and '2014-09-01' are both invalid dates. If the item is an array, the first two items are used to determine a date range Using rome.val.except([['2014-08-09', '2014-09-01']]) means anything between '2014-08-09' and '2014-09-01' is invalid. These two types of entries can be combined in any way you like. Each entry will exclude additional dates. For instance, [['2014-04-05', '2014-04-15'], ['2014-04-25', '2014-04-30'], '2014-05-05'] means that April 05 to 15, and April 25 to 30, along with May 05 are all invalid dates. rome.val.only(left, right) Identical behavior to rome.val.except, except for the fact that the selected dates become the only valid dates, rather than the only invalid dates. rome.moment Exposes the moment instance used by Rome. To change the moment instance, refer to rome.use(moment). rome.use(moment) Sets the instance of moment used by Rome.

It supports searching, remote data sets, and pagination of results. To get started, checkout examples and documentation at https://select2.github.io/ Use cases Enhancing native selects with search. Enhancing native selects with a better multi-select interface. Loading data from JavaScript: easily load items via AJAX and have them searchable. Nesting optgroups: native selects only support one level of nesting. Select2 does not have this restriction. Tagging: ability to add new items on the fly. Working with large, remote datasets: ability to partially load a dataset based on the search term. Paging of large datasets: easy support for loading more pages when the results are scrolled to the end. Templating: support for custom rendering of results and selections. Browser compatibility IE 8+ Chrome 8+ Firefox 10+ Safari 3+ Opera 10.6+ Select2 is automatically tested on the following browsers. Usage You can source Select2 directly from a CDN like JSDliver or CDNJS, download it from this GitHub repo, or use one of the integrations below. Integrations Third party developers have create plugins for platforms which allow Select2 to be integrated more natively and quickly. For many platforms, additional plugins are not required because Select2 acts as a standard <select> box. Plugins Django django-easy-select2 django-select2 Meteor - meteor-select2 Ruby on Rails - select2-rails Wicket - wicketstuff-select2 Yii 2 - yii2-widget-select2 Themes Bootstrap 3 - select2-bootstrap-theme Flat UI - select2-flat-theme Metro UI - select2-metro Missing an integration? Modify this README and make a pull request back here to Select2 on GitHub. Internationalization (i18n) Select2 supports multiple languages by simply including the right language JS file (dist/js/i18n/it.js, dist/js/i18n/nl.js, etc.) after dist/js/select2.js. Missing a language? Just copy src/js/select2/i18n/en.js, translate it, and make a pull request back to Select2 here on GitHub.

Supports cross-domain, chunked and resumable file uploads and client-side image resizing. Works with any server-side platform (PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, Java, Node.js, Go etc.) that supports standard HTML form file uploads. Setup How to setup the plugin on your website How to use only the basic plugin (minimal setup guide). Features Multiple file upload: Allows to select multiple files at once and upload them simultaneously. Drag & Drop support: Allows to upload files by dragging them from your desktop or filemanager and dropping them on your browser window. Upload progress bar: Shows a progress bar indicating the upload progress for individual files and for all uploads combined. Cancelable uploads: Individual file uploads can be canceled to stop the upload progress. Resumable uploads: Aborted uploads can be resumed with browsers supporting the Blob API. Chunked uploads: Large files can be uploaded in smaller chunks with browsers supporting the Blob API. Client-side image resizing: Images can be automatically resized on client-side with browsers supporting the required JS APIs. Preview images, audio and video: A preview of image, audio and video files can be displayed before uploading with browsers supporting the required APIs. No browser plugins (e.g. Adobe Flash) required: The implementation is based on open standards like HTML5 and JavaScript and requires no additional browser plugins. Graceful fallback for legacy browsers: Uploads files via XMLHttpRequests if supported and uses iframes as fallback for legacy browsers. HTML file upload form fallback: Allows progressive enhancement by using a standard HTML file upload form as widget element. Cross-site file uploads: Supports uploading files to a different domain with cross-site XMLHttpRequests or iframe redirects. Multiple plugin instances: Allows to use multiple plugin instances on the same webpage. Customizable and extensible: Provides an API to set individual options and define callBack methods for various upload events. Multipart and file contents stream uploads: Files can be uploaded as standard ""multipart/form-data"" or file contents stream (HTTP PUT file upload). Compatible with any server-side application platform: Works with any server-side platform (PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, Java, Node.js, Go etc.) that supports standard HTML form file uploads. Requirements Mandatory requirements jQuery v. 1.6+ jQuery UI widget factory v. 1.9+ (included): Required for the basic File Upload plugin, but very lightweight without any other dependencies from the jQuery UI suite. jQuery Iframe Transport plugin (included): Required for browsers without XHR file upload support. Optional requirements JavaScript Templates engine v. 2.5.4+: Used to render the selected and uploaded files for the Basic Plus UI and jQuery UI versions. JavaScript Load Image library v. 1.13.0+: Required for the image previews and resizing functionality. JavaScript Canvas to Blob polyfill v. 2.1.1+:Required for the image previews and resizing functionality. blueimp Gallery v. 2.15.1+: Used to display the uploaded images in a lightbox. Bootstrap v. 3.2.0+ Glyphicons The user interface of all versions except the jQuery UI version is built with Bootstrap and icons from Glyphicons. Cross-domain requirements Cross-domain File Uploads using the Iframe Transport plugin require a redirect back to the origin server to retrieve the upload results. The example implementation makes use of result.html as a static redirect page for the origin server. The repository also includes the jQuery XDomainRequest Transport plugin, which enables limited cross-domain AJAX requests in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9 (IE 10 supports cross-domain XHR requests). The XDomainRequest object allows GET and POST requests only and doesn't support file uploads. It is used on the Demo to delete uploaded files from the cross-domain demo file upload service. Custom Backends You can add support for various backends by adhering to the specification outlined here. Browsers Desktop browsers The File Upload plugin is regularly tested with the latest browser versions and supports the following minimal versions: Google Chrome Apple Safari 4.0+ Mozilla Firefox 3.0+ Opera 11.0+ Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0+ Mobile browsers The File Upload plugin has been tested with and supports the following mobile browsers: Apple Safari on iOS 6.0+ Google Chrome on iOS 6.0+ Google Chrome on Android 4.0+ Default Browser on Android 2.3+ Opera Mobile 12.0+ Supported features For a detailed overview of the features supported by each browser version, please have a look at the Extended browser support information.

This means that a user can drag and drop a file onto it, and the file gets uploaded to the server via AJAX. If you want support, please use stackoverflow with the dropzone.js tag and not the GitHub issues tracker. Only post an issue here if you think you discovered a bug or have a feature request. Please read the contributing guidelines before you start working on Dropzone! >> Download << Starting with version 2.0.0 this library does no longer depend on jQuery (but it still works as a jQuery module). Dropzone is compatible with component, there's a standalone version and an AMD module that's compatible with RequireJS in the downloads folder. Main features Image thumbnail previews. Simply register the callback thumbnail(file, data) and display the image wherever you like Retina enabled Multiple files and synchronous uploads Progress updates Support for large files Complete theming. The look and feel of Dropzone is just the default theme. You can define everything yourself by overwriting the default event listeners. Well tested Documentation For the full documentation and installation please visit www.dropzonejs.com Please also refer to the FAQ. Examples For examples, please see the GitHub wiki. Usage Implicit creation: <form id=""my-awesome-dropzone"" action=""/target"" class=""dropzone""></form> That's it. Really! Dropzone will automatically attach to it, and handle file drops. Want more control? You can configure dropzones like this: // ""myAwesomeDropzone"" is the camelized version of the ID of your HTML element Dropzone.options.myAwesomeDropzone = { maxFilesize: 1 }; ...or instantiate dropzone manually like this: new Dropzone(""div#my-dropzone"", { /* options */ }); Note that dropzones don't have to be forms. But if you choose another element you have to pass the url parameter in the options. For configuration options please look at the documentation on the website or at the source. Register for events If you want to register to some event you can do so on the dropzone object itself: Dropzone.options.myDropzone({   init: function() {     this.on(""error"", function(file, message) { alert(message); });   } }); // or if you need to access a Dropzone somewhere else: var myDropzone = Dropzone.forElement(""div#my-dropzone""); myDropzone.on(""error"", function(file, message) { alert(message); }); For a list of all events, please look at the chapter »Events« in the documentation or at the source. Browser support Chrome 7+ Firefox 4+ IE 10+ Opera 12+ (Version 12 for MacOS is disabled because their API is buggy) Safari 6+ For all the other browsers, dropzone provides an oldschool file input fallback. Why another library? I realize that there are already other libraries out there but the reason I decided to write my own are the following: I didn't want it to be too big, and to cumbersome to dive into. I want to design my own elements. I only want to register callbacks so I can update my elements accordingly. Big files should get uploaded without a problem. I wanted a callback for image previews, that don't kill the browser if too many too big images are viewed. I want to use the latest API of browsers. I don't care if it falls back to the normal upload form if the browser is too old. I don't think that it's necessary anymore to depend on libraries such as jQuery (especially when providing functionality that isn't available in old browsers anyway).

The library is designed to introduce fault-tolerance into the upload of large files through HTTP. This is done by splitting each file into small chunks. Then, whenever the upload of a chunk fails, uploading is retried until the procedure completes. This allows uploads to automatically resume uploading after a network connection is lost either locally or to the server. Additionally, it allows for users to pause, resume and even recover uploads without losing state because only the currently uploading chunks will be aborted, not the entire upload. Flow.js does not have any external dependencies other than the HTML5 File API. This is relied on for the ability to chunk files into smaller pieces. Currently, this means that support is limited to Firefox 4+, Chrome 11+, Safari 6+ and Internet Explorer 10+. Samples and examples are available in the samples/ folder. Please push your own as Markdown to help document the project. Can I see a demo? Flow.js + angular.js file upload demo - ng-flow extension page https://github.com/flowjs/ng-flow JQuery and node.js backend demo https://github.com/flowjs/flow.js/tree/master/samples/Node.js How can I install it? Download a latest build from https://github.com/flowjs/flow.js/releases it contains development and minified production files in dist/ folder. or use bower: bower install flow.js#~2 or use git clone git clone https://github.com/flowjs/flow.js How can I use it? A new Flow object is created with information of what and where to post: var flow = new Flow({   target:'/api/photo/redeem-upload-token',    query:{upload_token:'my_token'} }); // Flow.js isn't supported, fall back on a different method if(!flow.support) location.href = '/some-old-crappy-uploader'; To allow files to be either selected and drag-dropped, you'll assign drop target and a DOM item to be clicked for browsing: flow.assignBrowse(document.getElementById('browseButton')); flow.assignDrop(document.getElementById('dropTarget')); After this, interaction with Flow.js is done by listening to events: flow.on('fileAdded', function(file, event){     console.log(file, event); }); flow.on('fileSuccess', function(file,message){     console.log(file,message); }); flow.on('fileError', function(file, message){     console.log(file, message); }); How do I set it up with my server? Most of the magic for Flow.js happens in the user's browser, but files still need to be reassembled from chunks on the server side. This should be a fairly simple task and can be achieved in any web framework or language, which is able to receive file uploads. To handle the state of upload chunks, a number of extra parameters are sent along with all requests: flowChunkNumber: The index of the chunk in the current upload. First chunk is 1 (no base-0 counting here). flowTotalChunks: The total number of chunks. flowChunkSize: The general chunk size. Using this value and flowTotalSize you can calculate the total number of chunks. Please note that the size of the data received in the HTTP might be lower than flowChunkSize of this for the last chunk for a file. flowTotalSize: The total file size. flowIdentifier: A unique identifier for the file contained in the request. flowFilename: The original file name (since a bug in Firefox results in the file name not being transmitted in chunk multipart posts). flowRelativePath: The file's relative path when selecting a directory (defaults to file name in all browsers except Chrome). You should allow for the same chunk to be uploaded more than once; this isn't standard behaviour, but on an unstable network environment it could happen, and this case is exactly what Flow.js is designed for. For every request, you can confirm reception in HTTP status codes (can be change through the permanentErrors option): 200, 201, 202: The chunk was accepted and correct. No need to re-upload. 404, 415. 500, 501: The file for which the chunk was uploaded is not supported, cancel the entire upload. Anything else: Something went wrong, but try reuploading the file. Handling GET (or test() requests) Enabling the testChunks option will allow uploads to be resumed after browser restarts and even across browsers (in theory you could even run the same file upload across multiple tabs or different browsers). The POST data requests listed are required to use Flow.js to receive data, but you can extend support by implementing a corresponding GET request with the same parameters: If this request returns a 200, 201 or 202 HTTP code, the chunks is assumed to have been completed. If request returns a permanent error status, upload is stopped. If request returns anything else, the chunk will be uploaded in the standard fashion. After this is done and testChunks enabled, an upload can quickly catch up even after a browser restart by simply verifying already uploaded chunks that do not need to be uploaded again. Full documentation Flow Configuration The object is loaded with a configuration options: var r = new Flow({opt1:'val', ...}); Available configuration options are: target The target URL for the multipart POST request. This can be a string or a function. If a function, it will be passed a FlowFile, a FlowChunk and isTest boolean (Default: /) singleFile Enable single file upload. Once one file is uploaded, second file will overtake existing one, first one will be canceled. (Default: false) chunkSize The size in bytes of each uploaded chunk of data. The last uploaded chunk will be at least this size and up to two the size, see Issue #51 for details and reasons. (Default: 1*1024*1024) forceChunkSize Force all chunks to be less or equal than chunkSize. Otherwise, the last chunk will be greater than or equal to chunkSize. (Default: false) simultaneousUploads Number of simultaneous uploads (Default: 3) fileParameterName The name of the multipart POST parameter to use for the file chunk (Default: file) query Extra parameters to include in the multipart POST with data. This can be an object or a function. If a function, it will be passed a FlowFile, a FlowChunk object and a isTest boolean (Default: {}) headers Extra headers to include in the multipart POST with data. If a function, it will be passed a FlowFile, a FlowChunk object and a isTest boolean (Default: {}) withCredentials Standard CORS requests do not send or set any cookies by default. In order to include cookies as part of the request, you need to set the withCredentials property to true. (Default: false) method Method to use when POSTing chunks to the server (multipart or octet) (Default: multipart) testMethod HTTP method to use when chunks are being tested. If set to a function, it will be passed a FlowFile and a FlowChunk arguments. (Default: GET) uploadMethod HTTP method to use when chunks are being uploaded. If set to a function, it will be passed a FlowFile and a FlowChunk arguments. (Default: POST) allowDuplicateUploads Once a file is uploaded, allow reupload of the same file. By default, if a file is already uploaded, it will be skipped unless the file is removed from the existing Flow object. (Default: false) prioritizeFirstAndLastChunk Prioritize first and last chunks of all files. This can be handy if you can determine if a file is valid for your service from only the first or last chunk. For example, photo or video meta data is usually located in the first part of a file, making it easy to test support from only the first chunk. (Default: false) testChunks Make a GET request to the server for each chunks to see if it already exists. If implemented on the server-side, this will allow for upload resumes even after a browser crash or even a computer restart. (Default: true) preprocess Optional function to process each chunk before testing & sending. To the function it will be passed the chunk as parameter, and should call the preprocessFinished method on the chunk when finished. (Default: null) initFileFn Optional function to initialize the fileObject. To the function it will be passed a FlowFile and a FlowChunk arguments. readFileFn Optional function wrapping reading operation from the original file. To the function it will be passed the FlowFile, the startByte and endByte, the fileType and the FlowChunk. generateUniqueIdentifier Override the function that generates unique identifiers for each file. (Default: null) maxChunkRetries The maximum number of retries for a chunk before the upload is failed. Valid values are any positive integer and undefined for no limit. (Default: 0) chunkRetryInterval The number of milliseconds to wait before retrying a chunk on a non-permanent error. Valid values are any positive integer and undefined for immediate retry. (Default: undefined) progressCallbacksInterval The time interval in milliseconds between progress reports. Set it to 0 to handle each progress callback. (Default: 500) speedSmoothingFactor Used for calculating average upload speed. Number from 1 to 0. Set to 1 and average upload speed wil be equal to current upload speed. For longer file uploads it is better set this number to 0.02, because time remaining estimation will be more accurate. This parameter must be adjusted together with progressCallbacksInterval parameter. (Default 0.1) successStatuses Response is success if response status is in this list (Default: [200,201, 202]) permanentErrors Response fails if response status is in this list (Default: [404, 415, 500, 501]) Properties .support A boolean value indicator whether or not Flow.js is supported by the current browser. .supportDirectory A boolean value, which indicates if browser supports directory uploads. .opts A hash object of the configuration of the Flow.js instance. .files An array of FlowFile file objects added by the user (see full docs for this object type below). Methods .assignBrowse(domNodes, isDirectory, singleFile, attributes) Assign a browse action to one or more DOM nodes. domNodes array of dom nodes or a single node. isDirectory Pass in true to allow directories to be selected (Chrome only, support can be checked with supportDirectory property). singleFile To prevent multiple file uploads set this to true. Also look at config parameter singleFile. attributes Pass object of keys and values to set custom attributes on input fields. For example, you can set accept attribute to image/*. This means that user will be able to select only images. Full list of attributes: http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/input.file.html#input.file-attributes Note: avoid using a and button tags as file upload buttons, use span instead. .assignDrop(domNodes) Assign one or more DOM nodes as a drop target. .unAssignDrop(domNodes) Unassign one or more DOM nodes as a drop target. .on(event, callback) Listen for event from Flow.js (see below) .off([event, [callback]]): .off() All events are removed. .off(event) Remove all callbacks of specific event. .off(event, callback) Remove specific callback of event. callback should be a Function. .upload() Start or resume uploading. .pause() Pause uploading. .resume() Resume uploading. .cancel() Cancel upload of all FlowFile objects and remove them from the list. .progress() Returns a float between 0 and 1 indicating the current upload progress of all files. .isUploading() Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the instance is currently uploading anything. .addFile(file) Add a HTML5 File object to the list of files. .removeFile(file) Cancel upload of a specific FlowFile object on the list from the list. .getFromUniqueIdentifier(uniqueIdentifier) Look up a FlowFile object by its unique identifier. .getSize() Returns the total size of the upload in bytes. .sizeUploaded() Returns the total size uploaded of all files in bytes. .timeRemaining() Returns remaining time to upload all files in seconds. Accuracy is based on average speed. If speed is zero, time remaining will be equal to positive infinity Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY Events .fileSuccess(file, message, chunk) A specific file was completed. First argument file is instance of FlowFile, second argument message contains server response. Response is always a string. Third argument chunk is instance of FlowChunk. You can get response status by accessing xhr object chunk.xhr.status. .fileProgress(file, chunk) Uploading progressed for a specific file. .fileAdded(file, event) This event is used for file validation. To reject this file return false. This event is also called before file is added to upload queue, this means that calling flow.upload() function will not start current file upload. Optionally, you can use the browser event object from when the file was added. .filesAdded(array, event) Same as fileAdded, but used for multiple file validation. .filesSubmitted(array, event) Same as filesAdded, but happens after the file is added to upload queue. Can be used to start upload of currently added files. .fileRemoved(file) The specific file was removed from the upload queue. Combined with filesSubmitted, can be used to notify UI to update its state to match the upload queue. .fileRetry(file, chunk) Something went wrong during upload of a specific file, uploading is being retried. .fileError(file, message, chunk) An error occurred during upload of a specific file. .uploadStart() Upload has been started on the Flow object. .complete() Uploading completed. .progress() Uploading progress. .error(message, file, chunk) An error, including fileError, occurred. .catchAll(event, ...)

Properties .flowObj A back-reference to the parent Flow object. .file The correlating HTML5 File object. .name The name of the file. .relativePath The relative path to the file (defaults to file name if relative path doesn't exist) .size Size in bytes of the file. .uniqueIdentifier A unique identifier assigned to this file object. This value is included in uploads to the server for reference, but can also be used in CSS classes etc when building your upload UI. .averageSpeed Average upload speed, bytes per second. .currentSpeed Current upload speed, bytes per second. .chunks An array of FlowChunk items. You shouldn't need to dig into these. .paused Indicated if file is paused. .error Indicated if file has encountered an error. Methods .progress(relative) Returns a float between 0 and 1 indicating the current upload progress of the file. If relative is true, the value is returned relative to all files in the Flow.js instance. .pause() Pause uploading the file. .resume() Resume uploading the file. .cancel() Abort uploading the file and delete it from the list of files to upload. .retry() Retry uploading the file. .bootstrap() Rebuild the state of a FlowFile object, including reassigning chunks and XMLHttpRequest instances. .isUploading() Returns a boolean indicating whether file chunks is uploading. .isComplete() Returns a boolean indicating whether the file has completed uploading and received a server response. .sizeUploaded() Returns size uploaded in bytes. .timeRemaining() Returns remaining time to finish upload file in seconds. Accuracy is based on average speed. If speed is zero, time remaining will be equal to positive infinity Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY .getExtension() Returns file extension in lowercase. .getType() Returns file type.

Basically, a set of tools that will help you to build a reliable and visually appealing file uploader in minutes. Historically, Plupload comes from a dark and hostile age of no HTML5, hence all the alternative fallbacks, like Flash, Silverlight and Java (still in development). It is meant to provide an API, that will work anywhere and in any case, in one way or another. While having very solid fallbacks, Plupload is built with the future of HTML5 in mind.

Internally, browsers only had the input[type=""file""] element. It was ugly and clunky at the same time. One couldn't even change it's visuals, without hiding it and coding another one on top of it from scratch. And then there was no progress indication for the upload process... Sounds pretty crazy today. It was very logical for developers to look for alternatives and writing their own implementations, using Flash and Java, in order to somehow extend limited browser capabilities. And so did we, in our search for a reliable and flexible file uploader for our TinyMCE's MCImageManager. Quickly enough though, Plupload grew big. It easily split into a standalone project. With major version 2.0 it underwent another huge reconstruction, basically from the ground up, as all the low-level runtime logic has been extracted into separate File API and XHR L2 pollyfills (currently known under combined name of mOxie), giving Plupload a chance to evolve further. Structure Currently, Plupload may be considered as consisting of three parts: low-level pollyfills, Plupload API and Widgets (UI and Queue). Initially, Widgets were meant only to serve as examples of the API, but quickly formed into fully-functional API implementations that now come bundled with the Plupload API. This has been a source for multiple misconceptions about the API as Widgets were easily mistaken for the Plupload itself. They are only implementations, such as any of you can build by yourself out of the API. Low-level pollyfills (mOxie) - have their own code base and documentation on GitHub. Plupload API UI Widget Queue Widget Building instructions Plupload depends on File API and XHR2 L2 pollyfills that currently have their own repository on GitHub. However, in most cases you shouldn't care as we bundle the latest build of mOxie, including full and minified JavaScript source and pre-compiled SWF and XAP components, with every release. You can find everything you may need under js/ folder. There are cases where you might need a custom build, for example free of unnecessary runtimes, half the original size, etc. The difficult part of this task comes from mOxie and its set of additional runtimes that require special tools on your workstation in order to compile. Consider build instructions for mOxie - everything applies to Plupload as well. First of all, if you want to build custom Plupload packages you will require Node.js, as this is our build environment of choice. Node.js binaries (as well as Source) are available for all major operating systems. Plupload includes mOxie as a submodule, it also depends on some other repositories for building up it's dev environment - to avoid necessity of downloading them one by one, we recommended you to simply clone Plupload with git recursively (you will require git installed on your system for this operation to succeed): git clone --recursive https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload.git  And finalize the preparation stage with: npm install - this will install all additional modules, including those required by dev and test environments. In case you would rather keep it minimal, add a --production flag. Note: Currently, for an unknown reason, locally installed Node.js modules on Windows, may not be automatically added to the system PATH. So, if jake commands below are not recognized you will need to add them manually: set PATH=%PATH%;%CD%\node_modules\.bin\  Support We are actively standing behind the Plupload and now that we are done with major rewrites and refactoring, the only real goal that we have ahead is making it as reliable and bulletproof as possible. We are open to all the suggestions and feature requests. We ask you to file bug reports if you encounter any. We may not react to them instantly, but we constantly bear them in my mind as we extend the code base. In addition to dedicated support for those who dare to buy our OEM licenses, we got discussion boards, which is like an enormous FAQ, covering every possible application case. Of course, you are welcome to file a bug report or feature request, here on GitHub. Sometimes it is easier to notice the problem when bug report is accompained by the actual code. Consider providing a Plupload fiddle for the troublesome code. Contributing We are open to suggestions and code revisions, however there are some rules and limitations that you might want to consider first. Code that you contribute will automatically be licensed under the GPL, but will not be limited to GPL. Although all contributors will get the credit for their work, copyright notices will be changed to Ephox. Third party code will be reviewed, tested and possibly modified before being released. These basic rules help us earn a living and ensure that code remains Open Source and compatible with GPL license. All contributions will be added to the changelog and appear in every release and on the site. An easy place to start is to translate Plupload to your language. You can read more about how to contribute at: http://www.plupload.com/contributing License Copyright 2016, Ephox Released under GPLv2 License. We also provide commercial license.

The main methods, ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit, gather information from the form element to determine how to manage the submit process. Both of these methods support numerous options which allows you to have full control over how the data is submitted. No special markup is needed, just a normal form. Submitting a form with AJAX doesn't get any easier than this! API jqXHR The jqXHR object is stored in element data-cache with the jqxhr key after each ajaxSubmit call. It can be accessed like this: var form = $('#myForm').ajaxSubmit({ /* options */ }); var xhr = form.data('jqxhr');  xhr.done(function() { ... }); ajaxForm( options ) Prepares a form to be submitted via AJAX by adding all of the necessary event listeners. It does not submit the form. Use ajaxForm in your document's ready function to prepare existing forms for AJAX submission, or with the delegation option to handle forms not yet added to the DOM. Use ajaxForm when you want the plugin to manage all the event binding for you. // prepare all forms for ajax submission $('form').ajaxForm({     target: '#myResultsDiv' }); ajaxSubmit( options ) Immediately submits the form via AJAX. In the most common use case this is invoked in response to the user clicking a submit button on the form. Use ajaxSubmit if you want to bind your own submit handler to the form. // bind submit handler to form $('form').on('submit', function(e) {     e.preventDefault(); // prevent native submit     $(this).ajaxSubmit({         target: 'myResultsDiv'     }) }); Options Note: all standard $.ajax options can be used. beforeSerialize Callback function invoked prior to form serialization. Provides an opportunity to manipulate the form before its values are retrieved. Returning false from the callback will prevent the form from being submitted. The callback is invoked with two arguments: the jQuery wrapped form object and the options object. beforeSerialize: function($form, options) {      // return false to cancel submit                   } beforeSubmit Callback function invoked prior to form submission. This provides an opportunity to manipulate the form before it's values are retrieved. Returning false from the callback will prevent the form from being submitted. The callback is invoked with three arguments: the form data in array format, the jQuery wrapped form object, and the options Oobject. beforeSubmit: function(arr, $form, options) {      // form data array is an array of objects with name and value properties     // [ { name: 'username', value: 'jresig' }, { name: 'password', value: 'secret' } ]      // return false to cancel submit                   } clearForm Boolean flag indicating whether the form should be cleared if the submit is successful data An object containing extra data that should be submitted along with the form. data: { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' } dataType Expected data type of the response. One of: null, 'xml', 'script', or 'json'. The dataType option provides a means for specifying how the server response should be handled. This maps directly to jQuery's dataType method. The following values are supported: 'xml': server response is treated as XML and the 'success' callback method, if specified, will be passed the responseXML value 'json': server response will be evaluted and passed to the 'success' callback, if specified 'script': server response is evaluated in the global context delegation true to enable support for event delegation requires jQuery v1.7+ // prepare all existing and future forms for ajax submission $('form').ajaxForm({     delegation: true }); error Callback function to be invoked upon error. forceSync Only applicable when explicity using the iframe option or when uploading files on browses that don't support XHR2. Set to true to remove the short delay before posting form when uploading files. The delay is used to allow the browser to render DOM updates prior to performing a native form submit. This improves usability when displaying notifications to the user, such as ""Please Wait..."" iframe Boolean flag indicating whether the form should always target the server response to an iframe instead of leveraging XHR when possible. iframeSrc String value that should be used for the iframe's src attribute when/if an iframe is used. iframeTarget Identifies the iframe element to be used as the response target for file uploads. By default, the plugin will create a temporary iframe element to capture the response when uploading files. This options allows you to use an existing iframe if you wish. When using this option the plugin will make no attempt at handling the response from the server. replaceTarget Optionally used along with the the target option. Set to true if the target should be replaced or false if only the target contents should be replaced. resetForm Boolean flag indicating whether the form should be reset if the submit is successful semantic Boolean flag indicating whether data must be submitted in strict semantic order (slower). Note that the normal form serialization is done in semantic order with the exception of input elements of type=""image"". You should only set the semantic option to true if your server has strict semantic requirements and your form contains an input element of type=""image"". success Callback function to be invoked after the form has been submitted. If a success callback function is provided it is invoked after the response has been returned from the server. It is passed the following arguments: responseText or responseXML value (depending on the value of the dataType option). statusText xhr (or the jQuery-wrapped form element if using jQuery < 1.4) jQuery-wrapped form element (or undefined if using jQuery < 1.4) target Identifies the element(s) in the page to be updated with the server response. This value may be specified as a jQuery selection string, a jQuery object, or a DOM element. type The method in which the form data should be submitted, 'GET' or 'POST'. uploadProgress Callback function to be invoked with upload progress information (if supported by the browser). The callback is passed the following arguments: event; the browser event position (integer) total (integer) percentComplete (integer) url URL to which the form data will be submitted. Utility Methods formSerialize Serializes the form into a query string. This method will return a string in the format: name1=value1&name2=value2 var queryString = $('#myFormId').formSerialize(); fieldSerialize Serializes field elements into a query string. This is handy when you need to serialize only part of a form. This method will return a string in the format: name1=value1&name2=value2 var queryString = $('#myFormId .specialFields').fieldSerialize(); fieldValue Returns the value(s) of the element(s) in the matched set in an array. This method always returns an array. If no valid value can be determined the array will be empty, otherwise it will contain one or more values. resetForm Resets the form to its original state by invoking the form element's native DOM method. clearForm Clears the form elements. This method emptys all of the text inputs, password inputs and textarea elements, clears the selection in any select elements, and unchecks all radio and checkbox inputs. It does not clear hidden field values. clearFields Clears selected field elements. This is handy when you need to clear only a part of the form. File Uploads The Form Plugin supports use of XMLHttpRequest Level 2 and FormData objects on browsers that support these features. As of today (March 2012) that includes Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. On these browsers (and future Opera and IE10) files uploads will occur seamlessly through the XHR object and progress updates are available as the upload proceeds. For older browsers, a fallback technology is used which involves iframes.

Countable is a zero-dependency library and comes in at 1KB when minified and gzipped. View the Demo Installation The preferred method of installation is bower. bower install Countable  Alternatively, you can download the latest zipball or copy the script directly. Usage Countable is available as a Node / CommonJS module, an AMD module and as a global. All methods are accessed on the Countable object directly. Callbacks The live and once methods both accept a callback. The given callback is then called whenever needed with a single parameter that carries all the relevant data. this is bound to the current element. Take the following code for an example. var area = document.getElementById('text')  Countable.once(area, function (counter) {   console.log(this, counter) }) => <textarea id=""text""></textarea>, { all: 0, characters: 0, paragraphs: 0, words: 0 }  Property Meaning paragraphs The number of paragraphs. Paragraphs can be separated by either a soft or a hard (two line breaks) return. To use hard returns, set the corresponding option (hardReturns). words The number of words. Words are split using spaces. characters The number of characters (without spaces). This contains all non-whitespace characters. all The number of characters including whitespace. This is the total number of all characters in the element. Countable.live(elements, callback, options) Bind the callback to all given elements. The callback gets called every time the element's value or text is changed. Countable.live(area, function (counter) {   console.log(counter) }) Countable.die(elements) Remove the bound callback from all given elements. Countable.die(area) Countable.once(elements, callback, options) Similar to Countable.live(), but the callback is only executed once, there are no events bound. Countable.once(area, function (counter) {   console.log(counter) }) Countable.enabled(element) Checks the live-counting functionality is bound to the given. Countable.enabled(area) Options Countable.live() and Countable.once() both accept a third argument, an options object that allows you to change how Countable treats certain aspects of your element's text. {   hardReturns: false,   stripTags: false,   ignoreReturns: false } By default, paragraphs are split by a single return (a soft return). By setting hardReturns to true, Countable splits paragraphs after two returns. Depending on your application and audience, you might need to strip HTML tags from the text before counting it. You can do this by setting stripTags to true. In most cases, returns should be counted as part of the all property. Set ignoreReturns to false to remove them from the counter. Browser Support Countable supports all modern browsers. Internet Explorer is supported down to version 7. Note that some browsers don't implement the oninput event consistently so there might be differences in the way Countable works in different browsers. Upgrading from version 1 Upgrading from version 1.x.x is easy. Most likely, you've used something like the following: var area = document.getElementById('area')  new Countable(area, function (counter) {   console.log(counter) }, { stripTags: true }) The new syntax offers more functions as described above, but to keep the live-counting functionality, you just write this: var area = document.getElementById('area')  Countable.live(area, function (counter) {   console.log(counter) }, { stripTags: true }) The callback parameter is no longer optional options.once has been replaced with Countable.once() Countable.live() and Countable.once() both accept one or more elements, rather than just a single one Inside the callback, this is now bound to the current element Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Everything is created with pure CSS, HTML, and Javascript — no images required. Usage (without jQuery) To use, you'll need to include the Card JavaScript files into your HTML. You can find the necessary file at /lib/js/card.js and include it in your HTML like so. <!-- at the end of BODY --> <script src=""/path/to/card.js""></script> Once you've included those files, you can initialize Card. var card = new Card({     // a selector or DOM element for the form where users will     // be entering their information     form: 'form', // *required*     // a selector or DOM element for the container     // where you want the card to appear     container: '.card-wrapper', // *required*      formSelectors: {         numberInput: 'input#number', // optional — default input[name=""number""]         expiryInput: 'input#expiry', // optional — default input[name=""expiry""]         cvcInput: 'input#cvc', // optional — default input[name=""cvc""]         nameInput: 'input#name' // optional - defaults input[name=""name""]     },      width: 200, // optional — default 350px     formatting: true, // optional - default true      // Strings for translation - optional     messages: {         validDate: 'valid\ndate', // optional - default 'valid\nthru'         monthYear: 'mm/yyyy', // optional - default 'month/year'     },      // Default placeholders for rendered fields - optional     placeholders: {         number: '•••• •••• •••• ••••',         name: 'Full Name',         expiry: '••/••',         cvc: '•••'     },      // if true, will log helpful messages for setting up Card     debug: false // optional - default false }); Installing card from npm If you're using npm, you can install card.js with: npm install --save card  var $ = require(""jquery""); // The current card.js code does not explictly require jQuery, but instead uses the global, so this line is needed. window.jQuery = $; var card = require(""card"");  Using multiple inputs for one field Card can be used in forms where you have multiple inputs that render to a single field (i.e. you have a first and last name input). To use Card with this functionality, just pass in a selector that selects the fields in the correct order. For example, <html> <body> <div class='card-wrapper'></div> <script src=""/path/to/card.js""></script> <form>     <input type=""text"" name=""number"">     <input type=""text"" name=""first-name""/>     <input type=""text"" name=""last-name""/>     <input type=""text"" name=""expiry""/>     <input type=""text"" name=""cvc""/> </form> <script> var card = new Card({     form: 'form',     container: '.card-wrapper',      formSelectors: {         nameInput: 'input[name=""first-name""], input[name=""last-name""]'     } }); </script> </body> </html> Rendering with different initial card placeholders Card renders with default placeholders for card name, number, expiry, and cvc. To override these placeholders, you can pass in a placeholders object. <html> <body> <div class='card-wrapper'></div> <script src=""/path/to/card.js""></script> <form>     <input type=""text"" name=""number"">     <input type=""text"" name=""name""/>     <input type=""text"" name=""expiry""/>     <input type=""text"" name=""cvc""/> </form> <script>  var card = new Card({     form: 'form',     container: '.card-wrapper',      placeholders: {         number: '**** **** **** ****',         name: 'Arya Stark',         expiry: '**/****',         cvc: '***'     } }); </script> </body> </html> Translation To render the card with the strings in a different language, you can pass in a messages object. <html> <body> <div class='card-wrapper'></div> <script src=""/path/to/card.js""></script> <form>     <input type=""text"" name=""number"">     <input type=""text"" name=""name""/>     <input type=""text"" name=""expiry""/>     <input type=""text"" name=""cvc""/> </form> <script>  var card = new Card({     form: 'form',     container: '.card-wrapper',      messages: {         validDate: 'expire\ndate',         monthYear: 'mm/yy'     } }); </script> </body> </html> Using with jQuery To use with jQuery, you'll need to include the jquery.card.js file into your HTML. You can find the necessary file at /lib/js/jquery.card.js and include it in your HTML like so. <!-- at the end of BODY --> <script src=""/path/to/jquery.card.js""></script> Once you've included those files, you can initialize Card with jQuery. $('form').card({     // a selector or DOM element for the container     // where you want the card to appear     container: '.card-wrapper', // *required*      // all of the other options from above });  Using with other javascript libraries Card has wrappers that make it easy to use with other javascript libraries: Angular angular-card Ember ember-credit-card React react-credit-card card-react Development To contribute, follow this steps: $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/jessepollak/card.git $ cd card $ git submodule init && git submodule update $ npm install $ npm start Now, if you go to localhost:8080/example in your browser, you should see the demo page.

Features It supports: Stems (little pointers) Automatic content download with AJAX Different styles Automatic repositioning of the tooltip if it's not in the viewport of the browser anymore All kind of triggers (The tooltip can be triggered by mouse over, click, form submit,... everything you can think of really) CSS3 Animations Well tested, with over 200 unit tests As of Version 2.0 Opentip does no longer depend on Prototype. You can choose any adapter you want so you can work with the framework of your choice. Supported frameworks are: Native. You can use this one if you don't use any framework. Ender Component jQuery Prototype If you want to contribute, please read on in the contribute file. If you are migrating from version 1.x please refer to the migration section Build status Master Develop Installation jQuery, Prototype, Native Just download lib/opentip.js and lib/adapter.FRAMEWORK.js and include them in this order. You can also take the already minified and combined files in the downloads/ folder. Component The easiest and recommended way to install opentip is with component. Just add enyo/opentip as dependency in your component.json and rebuild it. Simply requiring opentip then activates the tooltips: require ""opentip""; Ender If you prefer ender as package manager just install it like this: $ ender build opentip Bower Another package manager supported is bower: $ bower install opentip You should include opentip's CSS as well. It's in css/opentip.css. (Except for component of course which automatically bundles the css.) If you want to work it with <=IE8, you have to include excanvas as well. Please refer to the installation guide. Usage Version 2.4.6 With HTML data attributes: <div data-ot=""Tooltip content"" data-ot-show-on=""click"">Click me</div> or with the Javascript API: $('elementId').opentip('Content', { showOn: ""click"", ...options... }); For the complete documentation please visit www.opentip.org. Future plans Become library independant. I'm currently working on extracting all prototype functionality, so I can switch library easily. The next library I'll support will be jquery, and then mootools. Add more skins. Add cooler loading animation. Implement unit tests. If you have ideas, please contact me! Contribute Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING readme. Migrating from Opentip 1.x to 2.x Those are the major changes you should look out for when migrating from 1.x to 2.x: There's no Tip or Tips object anymore. Everything is done through Opentip The recommend way to create opentips now is to call new Opentip(element, content, title, options), or with the framework of your choice (eg, ender: $(""#my-div"").opentip(content, title options)) The instantiation of new tips inside an event (eg: onclick, onmouseover) is no longer supported! This would create new opentips everytime the event is fired. Opentip.debugging = true; does no longer exist. Use Opentip.debug = true; Positions are no longer of the weird form [ ""left"", ""top"" ] but simply strings like ""top left"" or ""right"" stem.size has been dropped in favor of stem.length and stem.base Most of the design is now done in JS since the whole thing is a canvas now. The way close buttons are defined has completely changed. Please refer to the docs for more information. Tagging Tagging in this project is done with my tag script.

Also it uses BEM naming convention particularly for the modifiers. If you find this useful and want to show some love & encouragement, I am on Gratipay. Get Started Get the library using one of the following ways: GitHub Full build [unminified] : https://raw.github.com/chinchang/hint.css/master/hint.css [minified] : https://raw.github.com/chinchang/hint.css/master/hint.min.css Base build (Does not include color themes and fancy effects) [unminified] : https://raw.github.com/chinchang/hint.css/master/hint.base.css [minified] : https://raw.github.com/chinchang/hint.css/master/hint.base.min.css Bower : bower install hint.css npm: npm install --save hint.css CDN: http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!hint.css or https://cdnjs.com/libraries/hint.css Now include the library in the HEAD tag of your page: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""hint.css""></link> or <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""hint.min.css""></link> Now, all you need to do is give your element any position class and tooltip text using the aria-label attribute. Note, if you don't want to use aria-label attribute, you can also specify the tooltip text using the data-hint attribute, but its recommended to use aria-label in support of accessibility. Read more about aria-label. Hello Sir, <span class=""hint--bottom"" aria-label=""Thank you!"">hover me.</span> Use it with other available modifiers in various combinations. Available modifiers: Colors - hint--error, hint--info, hint--warning, hint--success Sizes - hint--small, hint--medium, hint--large hint--always hint--rounded hint--no-animate hint--bounce Upgrading from v1.x If you are already using v1.x, you may need to tweak certain position classes because of the way tooltips are positioned in v2. Changing the prefix for class names Don't like BEM naming (hint--) or want to use your own prefix for the class names? Simply update src/hint-variables.scss and change the $hintPrefix variable. To generate the css file, please read the contributing page. Who's Using This? Webflow Playground Panda chrome app Tolks Tridiv Prototyp Tradus Formspree Stackshare TypeScript Builder Fiverr's Devflow codeMagic Are you using hint.css in your awesome project too? Just tweet it out to @hint_css or let us know on the mailing list. Browser Support hint.css works on all latest browsers, though the transition effect is supported only on IE10+, Chrome 26+ and FF4+ at present. Chrome - basic + transition effects Firefox - basic + transition effects Opera - basic Safari - basic IE 10+ - basic + transition effects IE 8 & 9 - basic Contributing hint.css is developed in SASS and the source files can be found in the src/ directory.

See it in action here: http://gristmill.github.com/jquery-popbox/example.html Usage jQuery PopBox requires a specific HTML structure in order to work. There is also a small stylesheet that can be used. jQuery is a dependency. <head>   <script type='text/javascript' charset='utf-8' src='jquery.js'></script>   <script type='text/javascript' charset='utf-8' src='popbox.js'></script>   <link rel='stylesheet' href='popbox.css' type='text/css'> </head> The HTML structure looks like this. <div class='popbox'>   <a class='open' href='#'>Click Here!</a>    <div class='collapse'>     <div class='box'>       <div class='arrow'></div>       <div class='arrow-border'></div>        Content in PopBox goes here :)        <a href=""#"" class=""close"">close</a>     </div>   </div> </div> Invoke the plugin by calling it on a selector like normal. <script type='text/javascript'>    $(document).ready(function(){      $('.popbox').popbox();    }); </script> If there are any CSS class name conflicts, they can be overridden. <script type='text/javascript'>    $(document).ready(function(){      $('.popbox').popbox({        'open'          : '.open',        'box'           : '.box',        'arrow'         : '.arrow',        'arrow_border'  : '.arrow_border',        'close'         : '.close'       });    }); </script> Screenshot Credits jQuery PopBox developed by Sean Behan at Gristmill.io It is inspired by the balloon UI element found in 37Signals Highrise CRM.

It uses new concept showing depth between popup and page. It works in all modern browsers and gracefully degrade in those that do not support CSS transitions and transformations. Tested with jQuery versions 1.4+ File size of minified version is ~1Kb. Usage You can simply include javascript file and init Avgrund with one line: $('element').avgrund(); and linking avgrund.css file to the project: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""path/to/your/avgrund.css""> If you use bower then you can simply install it as: bower install jquery.avgrund Using plugin with Browserify At first install plugin via NPM: npm install jquery.avgrund npm install jquery-browserify In your server-side node.js (e.g. express app): app.use(require('browserify')({     require : ['jquery-browserify', 'jquery.avgrund'] })); And in your browser-side you can init plugin now: var $ = require('jquery-browserify'); require('jquery.avgrund')($); Options You're also able to use some of the options that let you customize it as you wish: $('element').avgrund({     width: 380, // max is 640px     height: 280, // max is 350px     showClose: false, // switch to 'true' for enabling close button     showCloseText: '', // type your text for close button     closeByEscape: true, // enables closing popup by 'Esc'..     closeByDocument: true, // ..and by clicking document itself     holderClass: '', // lets you name custom class for popin holder..     overlayClass: '', // ..and overlay block     enableStackAnimation: false, // enables different type of popin's animation     onBlurContainer: '', // enables blur filter for specified block     openOnEvent: true, // set to 'false' to init on load     setEvent: 'click', // use your event like 'mouseover', 'touchmove', etc.     onLoad: function (elem) { ... }, // set custom call before popin is inited..     onUnload: function (elem) { ... }, // ..and after it was closed     template: 'Your string content goes here..' // or function (elem) { ... }, or selector $('.content') }); More detailed information on every option you can find here. Documentation Here is the list of available avgrund options: width - string | number, default: '380px' Set popup width (currently stict to max 640px). height - string | number, default: '280px' Set popup height (currently strict to max 350px). showClose - boolean, default: false Show/hide close button. showCloseText - string If you decided to show close button then you probably want to add close text to it. closeByEscape - boolean, default: true Allow users to close popup by clicking Esc button. closeByDocument - boolean, default: true Allow users to close popup by clicking everywhere on document (except popup of course). holderClass - string Adds custom css classes to avgrund popup, example: $(element).avgrund({     holderClass: 'my-custom-class' }); results in adding this class to avgrund container: <div class=""avgrund-popin my-custom-class"">...</div> overlayClass - string Adds custom css classes to avgrund overlay container. enableStackAnimation - boolean, default: false Possibility to add a bit different popup hiding animation type. onBlurContainer - string Class name for container element that will be blurred when popup appears, example: $(element).avgrund({     onBlurContainer: '#my-container' }); Please note that currently css blur is not supported in all modern browsers. openOnEvent - boolean, default: true If you want to show avgrund on page load set this option value to false, example: $(document).avgrund({     openOnEvent: false }); setEvent - string, default: 'click' With this option you can manage events that will open popup on certain element: $(element).avgrund({     setEvent: 'mouseover' // will open popin on element's mouseover }); onLoad - function If you need to make some preparations or whatever before avgrund popup will be shown, example: $(element).avgrund({     onLoad: function (element) {         console.log('This function will be called before dialog is initialized');     } }); onUnload - function This function will be executed after popup was closed, example: $(element).avgrund({     onUnload: function (element) {         console.log('This message will be shown after dialog is closed');     } }); template - string | function | jQuery object Specify your content for popin here, it can be string value: $(element).avgrund({     template: '<p>This is popin content!</p>' }); or function that returns content itself: $(element).avgrund({     template: function (element) {         // return 'your content..'     } }); Also it accepts jQuery objects (dynamic as well), so you can create element with content inside your app: <div class=""content"" style=""display: none;"">     My content for popin! </div> and use it in template of popin: $('element').avgrund({     template: $('.content') }); Demo Check the example here: http://labs.voronianski.com/jquery.avgrund.js/ Inspired by Hakim's demo: https://github.com/hakimel/avgrund/ Changelog Update (Sep 28, 2013) Added AMD and CommonJS styles support. Update (Sep 22, 2013) Added support jQuery selectors in template option. Update (June 15, 2013) Better fix for overlay and long content pages, minor add-ons. Update (May 26, 2013) Few fixes, and plugin is available as bower package now. So you can simply install it as: Update (Feb 25, 2013) A bunch of small but very useful fixes and updates, including multiple avgrund popins on a page, removing popins from DOM after deactivation (also fixed an issue to make sure avgrund close effect works) and position:fixed/transform/overflow issue for scrolled pages in -webkit. Update (Nov 18, 2012) Get 2 new useful options for popin that were missed before. Now you can set your custom functions before Avgrund dialog is open and after it was closed. Update (Sep 30, 2012) Some new updates include initializing popin without event. Also now you can set up your own event for an element. Added ability to use a custom function inside avgrund's template option. Thanks to juice49 for pull request. Update (Aug 31, 2012) New options added - disable closing popup by 'Esc' and 'Document click'. Blur css filter for browsers that support it (seems only webkit ones for now). Contribution We still have some issues to fix and make avgrund better, if you have any suggestions raise them in issues please. MIT Licensed enjoy!

Currently I believe the default BS3 modal addresses some of the bigger issues and is not worth maintaining two versions of this plugin. Bootstrap Modal v2.2.6 See live demo here. Extends Bootstrap's native modals to provide additional functionality. Introduces a ModalManager class that operates behind the scenes to handle multiple modals by listening on their events. A single ModalManager is created by default on body and can be accessed through the jQuery plugin interface. $('body').modalmanager('loading');  Bootstrap-Modal can be used as a replacement for Bootstrap's Modal class or as a patch to the library. Bootstrap 3 If you're using BS3, I've provided a compatible css patch. Include bootstrap-modal-bs3patch.css before the main bootstrap-modal.css file to use this plugin with Bootstrap 3. If you're using the loading spinner functionality you may also need to change the default template to be compatible in js: $.fn.modal.defaults.spinner = $.fn.modalmanager.defaults.spinner =      '<div class=""loading-spinner"" style=""width: 200px; margin-left: -100px;"">' +         '<div class=""progress progress-striped active"">' +             '<div class=""progress-bar"" style=""width: 100%;""></div>' +         '</div>' +     '</div>';  Overview Backwards compatible Responsive Stackable Full width Load content via AJAX Disable background scrolling Installation Include css/bootstrap-modal.css after the main bootstrap css files. Include js/bootstrap-modalmanager.js and js/bootstrap-modal.js after the main bootstrap js files. Options In addition to the standard bootstrap options, you now have access to the following options Modal width Set the initial width of the modal. height Set the initial height of the modal. maxHeight Set the max-height of the modal-body. loading Toggle the loading state. spinner Provide a custom image or animation for the loading spinner. backdropTemplate Provide a custom modal backdrop. consumeTab Used to enable tabindexing for modals with data-tabindex. This is set to true by default. focusOn The element or selector to set the focus to once the modal is shown. replace If set to true, the modal will replace the topmost modal when opened. attentionAnimation Set the animation used by the attention method. Any animation in animate.css is supported but only the shake animation is included by default. modalOverflow Set this property to true for modals with highly dynamic content. This will force the modal to behave as if it is larger than the viewport. manager Set the modal's manager. By default this is set to the GlobalModalManager and will most likely not need to be overridden. ModalManager loading Toggle the loading state. backdropLimit Limit the amount of backdrops that will appear on the page at the same time. spinner Provide a custom image or animation for the loading spinner. backdropTemplate Provide a custom modalmanager backdrop. This backdrop is used when $element.modalmanager('loading') is called. Getting a reference to the modal manager If you did not created your own ModalManager, perhaps you'll need a reference to it. That can be easily accomplished using the following snippet:     var modalManager = $(""body"").data(""modalmanager"");     var openModals = modalManager.getOpenModals();     modalManager.removeLoading(); After that, you'll be able to call any methods that modal manager has, such as: removeLoading (remove the loading and backdrop window); getOpenModals (to get the modals that are already open); etc; Disable Background Scrolling If you want to prevent the background page from scrolling (see demo for example) you must wrap the page contents in a <div class=""page-container"">. For example: <body>     <div class=""page-container"">         <div class=""navbar navbar-fixed-top"">...</div>         <div class=""container"">...</div>     </div> </body>  The reason for doing this instead of just simply setting overflow: hidden when a modal is open is to avoid having the page shift as a result of the scrollbar appearing/disappearing. This also allows the document to be scrollable when there is a tall modal but only to the height of the modal, not the entire page. Constrain Modal to Window Size You can bind the height of the modal body to the window with something like this: $.fn.modal.defaults.maxHeight = function(){     // subtract the height of the modal header and footer     return $(window).height() - 165;  }  Note: This will be overwritten by the responsiveness and is only set when the modal is displayed, not when the window is resized. Tab Index for Modal Forms You can use data-tabindex instead of the default tabindex to specify the tabindex within a modal. <input type=""text"" data-tabindex=""1"" /> <input type=""text"" data-tabindex=""2"" />  See the stackable example on the demo page for an example.

Jun 6, 2016 modal.scss Move animations into separate SCSS file for better control Oct 12, 2014 package.json v1.5.0 May 12, 2016 README.md CSS Modals Modals built out of pure CSS Please visit the website to read more about this project and refer to the FAQ in case of a question. Gratipay me (aka. Gittip) if you enjoy this plugin. What is it Built with pure CSS: CSS Modal is built out of pure CSS. JavaScript is only for sugar. This makes them perfectly accessible. Optimized for mobile: The modals are designed using responsive web design methods. They work on all screen sizes from a small mobile phone up to high resolution screens. Use as Sass plugin: You can use CSS Modal as Sass plugin and apply it to your custom classes. No need to understand all the code. A few other advantages: Accessible, cross-browser, media-adaptive, small and fast! How to use Please be aware that modals get stacked above each other if you open one modal from within another. You can add a data-attribute data-stackable=""false"" to the modal in order to make it non-stackable. Markup You need to include the markup and content for modals in your website. This has a positive effect on SEO. The example code: <section class=""modal--show"" id=""modal-text"" tabindex=""-1""         role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""modal-label"" aria-hidden=""true"">      <div class=""modal-inner"">         <header id=""modal-label""><!-- Header --></header>         <div class=""modal-content""><!-- The modals content --></div>         <footer><!-- Footer --></footer>     </div>      <a href=""#!"" class=""modal-close"" title=""Close this modal"" data-close=""Close""         data-dismiss=""modal"">?</a> </section> The id attribute is the one which identifies the modal. You can link to this ID from everywhere. Please note that the ID cannot include the / character since this one is needed for identifying stacked modals. Using header and footer is optional. Just remove the tags if you don't want them in a modal. You should leave the link's href attribute that way to close the modal in order to prevent the page from scrolling to top when clicking on it. Please remember to set a unique ID for the header and change the aria-labelledby attribute to the same value. You link to a modal by simply setting the ID to a link element's href like this: <a href=""#modal"">Modal</a> If you want to decouple the modal call from the location's hash you need to add data-cssmodal-nohash to the link. Sass If you use Sass you can use the file modal.scss and include it into your project. Here is an example: @import ""modules/modal""; CSS Modals uses Sass's placeholders. You can use them by calling them via @extend in your modal's class name. The snippet looks something like that: .my-awesome-class-name {     @extend %modal; } JavaScript As stated above you don't need JavaScript to get a good experience out of CSS Modals. But there are some issues where JavaScript helps: IE 8 compatibility (please include jQuery if you need full compatibility). Pressing escape: If you press ESC on your keyboard while the modal is visible it closes itself. This behavior cannot be achieved with CSS only. Preventing background page from scrolling: If you scroll within the modal and you reach the end you don't want the page in the background to scroll. To prevent this JavaScript pushes a CSS class selector to the body element. Being accessible: To get the browser's focus to the modal and back after closing. Firing events: When a modal opens a custom event is fired called cssmodal:show. When the modal is hidden, an event called cssmodal:hide is triggered. To add this behavior to your website, please include the JavaScript file modal.js right before the closing body-tag: <script src=""js/modal.js""></script> Browser Support This modal is designed to work on all modern browsers. Unfortunately this does not include Internet Explorer 7 or lower. But we deal with IE 8 – well,… at least it works. On mobile Safari for iOS and Android 4+ it is tested pretty well, while Android 2.3 has some problems (biggest issue is scrolling). It's also working on Windows Phone 8. In numbers: Chrome Firefox Safari 6.x Opera 12+ Internet Explorer 8 (functional, include jQuery if you want support for events) Internet Explorer 9+ iOS 6 Android 2.3 (functional) Android 4.x Windows Phone 8 Media Please be aware that you need to stop playing videos or audio manually after hiding the modal. We have a plugin for this though. Events There is an event cssmodal:show fired on the modal itself after the modal is shown. Another event cssmodal:hide is fired after the modal is hidden. You can use the events by subscribing to them as if they were click events or something. Here is an example using jQuery: $(document).on('cssmodal:show', function (event) {     console.log(event); }); There events are not fired in IE8. Please be aware of that and use jQuery or something else to create custom events. Plugins We have a couple for the modal to enhance it: Resize - Resizes modal to size of input elements Gallery - A lightbox plugin (in connection with resize) HTML5 Video - Load videos within the modal Maximum Width - Set a custom maximum width on a per-modal basis Bug reports and feature requests If you got something that's worth including into the project please open an issue for further discussion.

See it in action! Learn how to use it! Usage You can install SweetAlert through bower: bower install sweetalert Or through npm: npm install sweetalert Alternatively, download the package and reference the JavaScript and CSS files manually: <script src=""dist/sweetalert.min.js""></script> <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""dist/sweetalert.css""> Note: If you're using an older version than v1.0.0, the files are lib/sweet-alert.min.js and lib/sweet-alert.css Tutorial The easiest way to get started is follow the SweetAlert tutorial on Ludu! Examples The most basic message: swal(""Hello world!""); A message signaling an error: swal(""Oops..."", ""Something went wrong!"", ""error""); A warning message, with a function attached to the ""Confirm""-button: swal({   title: ""Are you sure?"",   text: ""You will not be able to recover this imaginary file!"",   type: ""warning"",   showCancelButton: true,   confirmButtonColor: ""#DD6B55"",   confirmButtonText: ""Yes, delete it!"",   closeOnConfirm: false,   html: false }, function(){   swal(""Deleted!"",   ""Your imaginary file has been deleted."",   ""success""); }); A prompt modal where the user's input is logged: swal({   title: ""An input!"",   text: 'Write something interesting:',   type: 'input',   showCancelButton: true,   closeOnConfirm: false,   animation: ""slide-from-top"" }, function(inputValue){   console.log(""You wrote"", inputValue); }); Ajax request example: swal({   title: 'Ajax request example',   text: 'Submit to run ajax request',   type: 'info',   showCancelButton: true,   closeOnConfirm: false,   disableButtonsOnConfirm: true,   confirmLoadingButtonColor: '#DD6B55' }, function(inputValue){   setTimeout(function() {     swal('Ajax request finished!');   }, 2000); }); View more examples Themes SweetAlert can easily be themed to fit your site's design. SweetAlert comes with three example themes that you can try out: facebook, twitter and google. They can be referenced right after the intial sweetalert-CSS: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""dist/sweetalert.css""> <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""themes/twitter/twitter.css""> Browser compatibility SweetAlert works in most major browsers (yes, even IE). Some details: IE8: (Dropped since v1.0.0-beta) IE9: Works, but icons are not animated. IE10+: Works! Safari 4+: Works! Firefox 3+: Works! Chrome 14+: Works! Opera 15+: Works! Contributing If you want to contribute: Fork the repo Make sure you have Node, NPM and Gulp installed. When in the SweetAlert directory, run npm install to install the dependencies. Then run gulp while working to automatically minify the SCSS and JS-files. Keep in mind that SweetAlert uses Browserify in order to compile ES6-files. For easy debugging, make sure you reference the file dist/sweetalert-dev.js instead of sweetalert.js. After you're done, make a pull request and wait for approval! :) Related projects SweetAlert for Android SweetAlert for Bootstrap SweetAlert for AngularJS SweetAlert for RubyOnRails Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Include them somewhere in your document: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/baguetteBox.min.css""> <script src=""js/baguetteBox.min.js"" async></script> Usage Initialize the script by running: baguetteBox.run('.gallery'); where the first argument is a selector to a gallery (or galleries) containing a tags. The HTML code may look like this: <div class=""gallery"">     <a href=""img/2-1.jpg"" data-caption=""Image caption"">         <img src=""img/thumbs/2-1.jpg"" alt=""First image"">     </a>     <a href=""img/2-2.jpg"">         <img src=""img/thumbs/2-2.jpg"" alt=""Second image"">     </a>     ... </div> To use captions put a title or data-caption attribute on the a tag. Customization You can pass an object with custom options as the second parameter. baguetteBox.run('.gallery', {     // Custom options }); The following options are available: Option Type Default Description captions Boolean | function(element) true Display image captions. Passing a function will use a string returned by this callback. The only argument is a element containing the image. Invoked in the context of the current gallery array buttons Boolean | 'auto' 'auto' Display buttons. 'auto' hides buttons on touch-enabled devices or when only one image is available fullScreen Boolean false Enable full screen mode noScrollbars Boolean false Hide scrollbars when gallery is displayed titleTag Boolean false Use caption value also in the gallery img.title attribute async Boolean false Load files asynchronously preload Number 2 How many files should be preloaded animation 'slideIn' | 'fadeIn' | false 'slideIn' Animation type afterShow function null Callback to be run after showing the overlay afterHide function null Callback to be run after hiding the overlay onChange function(currentIndex, imagesCount) null Callback to be run when image changes overlayBackgroundColor String 'rgba (0,0,0,.8)' Background color for the lightbox overlay filter RegExp /.+\.(gif|jpe?g|png|webp)/i Pattern to match image files. Applied to the a.href attribute API run - initialize baguetteBox.js showNext - switch to the next image showPrevious - switch to the previous image destroy - remove the plugin with any event bindings The first two methods return true on success or false if there are no more images to be loaded. Responsive images To use this feature, simply put data-at-{width} attributes on a tags with a value being the path to the desired image. {width} should be the maximum screen width the image can be displayed at. The script chooses the first image with {width} greater than or equal to the current screen width for best user experience. That last data-at-X image is also used in the case of a screen larger than X. Here's an example of what the HTML code can look like: <a href=""img/2-1.jpg""   data-at-450=""img/thumbs/2-1.jpg""   data-at-800=""img/small/2-1.jpg""   data-at-1366=""img/medium/2-1.jpg""   data-at-1920=""img/big/2-1.jpg"">     <img src=""img/thumbs/2-1.jpg""> </a> If you have 1366x768 resolution baguetteBox.js will choose ""img/medium/2-1.jpg"". If, however, it's 1440x900 it'll choose ""img/big/2-1.jpg"". Keep the href attribute as a fallback (link to a bigger image e.g. of HD size) for older browsers. Compatibility IE 8+ Chrome Firefox 3.6+ Opera 12+ Safari 5+ Notes Feel free to report any issues! Credits Creation of baguetteBox.js was inspired by a great jQuery plugin touchTouch.

Version 1.4.2 - 2013/2/18 Removed $.contains for compatibility with jQuery 1.3.x Version 1.4.1 - 2013/2/14 Ignored left and right arrow keypresses if combined with the alt key. Version 1.4.0 - 2013/2/12 Better accessibility: Replaced div controls with buttons Tabbed navigation confined to modal window Added aria role Version 1.3.34 - 2013/2/4 Updated manifest for plugins.jquery.com Version 1.3.33 - 2013/2/4 Added retina display properties: retinaImage, retinaUrl, retinaSuffix Fixed iframe scrolling on iOS devices.

Version 1.3.26 - 2013/1/23 Minor bugfix: clear the onload event handler after photo has loaded. Version 1.3.25 - 2013/1/23 Removed grunt file & added Bower component.json. Version 1.3.24 - 2013/1/22 Added generated files (jquery.colorbox.js / jquery.colorbox-min.js) back to the repository. Version 1.3.23 - 2013/1/18 Minor bugfix for calling Colorbox on empty jQuery collections without a selector. Version 1.3.22 - 2013/1/17 Recommit for plugins.jquery.com Version 1.3.21 - 2013/1/15 Files Changed: *.js Fixed compatibility issues with jQuery 1.9 Version 1.3.20 - August 15 2012 Files Changed:jquery.colorbox.js Added temporary workaround for jQuery-UI 1.8 bug (http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12273) Added *.jpe extension to the list of image types. Version 1.3.19 - December 08 2011 Files Changed:jquery.colorbox.js, colorbox.css (all) Fixed bug related to using the 'fixed' property. Optimized the setup procedure to be more efficient. Removed $.colorbox.init() as it will no longer be needed (will self-init when called). Removed use of $.browser. Version 1.3.18 - October 07 2011 Files Changed:jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js, colorbox.css (all) and example 1's controls.png Fixed a regression where Flash content displayed in Colorbox would be reloaded if the browser window was resized. Added safety check to make sure that Colorbox's markup is only added to the DOM a single time, even if $.colorbox.init() is called multiple times. This will allow site owners to manually initialize Colorbox if they need it before the DOM has finished loading. Updated the example index.html files to be HTML5 compliant. Changed the slideshow behavior so that it immediately moves to the next slide when the slideshow is started. Minor regex bugfix to allow automatic detection of image URLs that include fragments. Version 1.3.17 - May 11 2011 Files Changed:jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Added properties ""top"", ""bottom"", ""left"" and ""right"" to specify a position relative to the viewport, rather than using the default centering. Added property ""data"" to specify GET or POST data when using Ajax. Colorbox's ajax functionality is handled by jQuery's .load() method, so the data property works the same way as it does with .load(). Added property ""fixed"" which can provide fixed positioning for Colorbox, rather than absolute positioning. This will allow Colorbox to remain in a fixed position within the visitors viewport, despite scrolling. IE6 support for this was not added, it will continue to use the default absolute positioning. Fixed ClearType problem with IE7. Minor fixes. Version 1.3.16 - March 01 2011 Files Changed:jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js, colorbox.css (all) and example 4 background png files Better IE related transparency workarounds. IE7 and up now uses the same background image sprite as other browsers. Added error handling for broken image links. A message will be displayed telling the user that the image could not be loaded. Added new property: 'fastIframe' and set it to true by default. Setting to fastIframe:false will delay the loading graphic removal and onComplete event until iframe has completely loaded. Ability to redefine $.colorbox.close (or prev, or next) at any time. Version 1.3.15 - October 27 2010 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Minor fixes for specific cases. Version 1.3.14 - October 27 2010 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js In IE6, closing an iframe when using HTTPS no longer generates a security warning. Version 1.3.13 - October 22 2010 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Changed the index.html example files to use YouTube's new embedded link format. By default, Colorbox returns focus to the element it was launched from once it closes. This can now be disabled by setting the 'returnFocus' property to false. Focus was causing problems for some users who had their anchor elements inside animated containers. Minor bug fix involved in using a combination of slideshow and non-slideshow content. Version 1.3.12 - October 20 2010 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Minor bug fix involved in preloading images when using a function as a value for the href property. Version 1.3.11 - October 19 2010 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Fixed the slideshow functionality that broke with 1.3.10 The slideshow now respects the loop property. Version 1.3.10 - October 16 2010 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Fixed compatibility with jQuery 1.4.3 The 'open' property now accepts a function as a value, like all of the other properties. Preloading now loads the correct href for images when using a dynamic (function) value for the href property. Fixed bug in Safari 3 for Win where Colorbox centered on the document, rather than the visitor's viewport. May have fixed an issue in Opera 10.6+ where Colorbox would rarely/randomly freeze up while switching between photos in a group. Some functionality better encapsulated & minor performance improvements. Version 1.3.9 - July 7 2010 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js/ all colorbox.css (the core styles) Fixed a problem where iframed youtube videos would cause a security alert in IE. More code is event driven now, making the source easier to grasp. Removed some unnecessary style from the core CSS. Version 1.3.8 - June 21 2010 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Fixed a bug in Chrome where it would sometimes render photos at 0 by 0 width and height (behavior introduced in recent update to Chrome). Fixed a bug where the onClosed callback would fire twice (only affected 1.3.7). Fixed a bug in IE7 that existed with some iframed websites that use JS to reposition the viewport caused Colorbox to move out of position. Abstracted the identifiers (HTML ids & classes, and JS plugin name, method, and events) so that the plugin can be easily rebranded. Small changes to improve either code readability or compression. Version 1.3.7 - June 13 2010 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js/index.html $.colorbox can now be used for direct calls and accessing public methods. Example: $.colorbox.close(); Resize now accepts 'width', 'innerWidth', 'height' and 'innerHeight'. Example: $.colorbox.resize({width:""100%""}) Added option (loop:false) to disable looping in a group. Added options (escKey:false, arrowKey:false) to disable esc-key and arrow-key bindings. Added method for removing Colorbox from a document: $.colorbox.remove(); Fixed a bug where iframed URLs would be truncated if they contained an unencoded apostrophe. Now uses the exact href specified on an anchor, rather than the version returned by 'this.href'. This was causing ""#example"" to be normalized to ""http://domain/#example"" which interfered with how some users were setting up links to inline content. Changed example documents over to HTML5. Version 1.3.6 - Jan 13 2010 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Small change to make Colorbox compatible with jQuery 1.4 Version 1.3.5 - December 15 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3.4 with IE7's display of example 2 and 3, and auto-width in Opera. Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3.4 where colorbox could not be launched by triggering an element's click event through JavaScript. Minor refinements. Version 1.3.4 - December 5 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Event delegation is now used for elements that Colorbox is assigned to, rather than individual click events. Additional callbacks have been added to represent other stages of Colorbox's lifecycle. Available callbacks, in order of their execution: onOpen, onLoad, onComplete, onCleanup, onClosed These take place at the same time as the event hooks, but will be better suited than the hooks for targeting specific instances of Colorbox. Ajax content is now immediately added to the DOM to be more compatible if that content contains script tags. Focus is now returned to the calling element on closing. Fixed a bug where maxHeight and maxWidth did not work for non-photo content. Direct calls no longer need 'open:true', it is assumed. Example: $.colorbox({html:'<p>Hi</p>'}); Version 1.3.3 - November 7 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Changed $.colorbox.element() to return a jQuery object rather the DOM element. jQuery.colorbox-min.js is compressed with Google's Closure Compiler rather than YUI Compressor. Version 1.3.2 - October 27 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Added 'innerWidth' and 'innerHeight' options to allow people to easily set the size dimensions for Colorbox, without having to anticipate the size of the borders and buttons. Renamed 'scrollbars' option to 'scrolling' to be in keeping with the existing HTML attribute. The option now also applies to iframes. Bug fix: In Safari, positioning occassionally incorrect when using '100%' dimensions. Bug fix: In IE6, the background overlay is briefly not full size when first viewing. Bug fix: In Firefox, opening Colorbox causes a split second shift with a small minority of webpage layouts. Simplified code in a few areas. Version 1.3.1 - September 16 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js/colorbox.css/colorbox-ie.css(removed) Removed the IE-only stylesheets and conditional comments for example styles 1 & 4. All CSS is handled by a single CSS file for all examples. Removed user-agent sniffing from the js and replaced it with feature detection. This will allow correct rendering for visitors masking their agent type. Version 1.3.0 - September 15 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js/colorbox.css Added $.colorbox.resize() method to allow Colorbox to resize it's height if it's contents change. Added 'scrollbars' option to allow users to turn off scrollbars when using the resize() method. Renamed the 'resize' option to be less ambiguous. It's now 'scalePhotos'. Renamed the 'cbox_close' event to be less ambiguous. It's now 'cbox_cleanup'. It is the first thing to happen in the close method while the 'cbox_closed' event is the last to happen. Fixed a bug with the slideshow mouseover graphics that appeared after Colorbox is opened a 2nd time. Fixed a bug where ClearType may not work in IE6&7 if using the fade transition. Minor code optimizations to increase compression. Version 1.2.9 - August 7 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Minor change to enable use with $.getScript(); Minor change to the timing of the 'cbox_load' event so that it is more useful. Added a direct link to a YouTube video to the examples. Version 1.2.8 - August 5 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Fixed a bug with the overlay in IE6 Fixed a bug where left & right keypress events might be prematurely unbound. Version 1.2.7 - July 31 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js, example stylesheets and background images (core styles have not changed and the updates will not affect existing user themes / old example themes) Code cleanup and reduction, better organization and documentation in the full source. Added ability to use functions in place of static values for Colorbox's options (thanks Ken!). Added an option for straight HTML. Example: $.colorbox({html:'<p>Howdy</p>', open:true}) Added an event for the beginning of the closing process. This is in addition to the event that already existed for when Colorbox had completely closed. 'cbox_close' and 'cbox_closed' respectively. Fixed a minor bug in IE6 that would cause a brief content shift in the parent document when opening Colorbox. Fixed a minor bug in IE6 that would reveal select elements that had a hidden visibility after closing Colorbox. The 'esc' key is unbound now when Colorbox is not open, to avoid any potential conflicts. Used background sprites for examples 1 & 4. Put IE-only (non-sprite) background images in a separate folder. Example themes 1, 3, & 4 received slight visual tweaks. Optimized pngs for smaller file size. Added slices, grid, and correct sizing to the Adobe Illustrator file, all theme files are now export ready! Version 1.2.6 - July 15 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Fixed a bug with fixed width/height images in Opera 9.64. Fixed a bug with trying to set a value for rel during a direct call to Colorbox. Example: $.colorbox({rel:'foo', open:true}); Changed how href/rel/title settings are determined to avoid users having to manually update Colorbox settings if they use JavaScript to update any of those attributes, after Colorbox has been defined. Fixed a FF3 bug where the back button was disabled after closing an iframe. Version 1.2.5 - June 23 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js Changed the point at which iframe srcs are set (to eliminate the need to refresh the iframe once it has been added to the DOM). Removed unnecessary return values for a very slight code reduction. Version 1.2.4 - June 9 2009 Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js, jquery.colorbox-min.js Fixed an issue where Colorbox may not close completely if it is closed during a transition animation. Minor code reduction. Version 1.2.3 - June 4 2009 Fixed a png transparency stacking issue in IE. More accurate Ajax auto-sizing if the user was depending on the #cboxLoadedContent ID for CSS styling. Added a public function for returning the current html element that Colorbox is associated with. Example use: var that = $.colorbox.element(); Added bicubic scaling for resized images in the original IE7. Removed the IE6 stylesheet and png files from Example 3. It now uses the same png file for the controls that the rest of the browsers use (an alpha transparency PNG8). This example now only has 2 graphics files and 1 stylesheet. Version 1.2.2 - May 28 2009 Fixed an issue with the 'resize' option. Version 1.2.1 - May 28 2009 Note: If you are upgrading, update your jquery.colorbox.js and colorbox.css files. Added photo resizing. Added a maximum width and maximum height. Example: {height:800, maxHeight:'100%'}, would allow the box to be a maximum potential height of 800px, instead of a fixed height of 800px. With maxHeight of 100% the height of Colorbox cannot exceed the height of the browser window. Added 'rel' setting to add the ability to set an alternative rel for any Colorbox call. This allows the user to group any combination of elements together for a gallery, or to override an existing rel. attribute so those element are not grouped together, without having to alter their rel in the HTML. Added a 'photo' setting to force Colorbox to display a link as a photo. Use this when automatic photo detection fails (such as using a url like 'photo.php' instead of 'photo.jpg', 'photo.jpg#1', or 'photo.jpg?pic=1') Removed the need to ever create disposable elements to call colorbox on. Colorbox can now be called directly, without being associated with any existing element, by using the following format: $.colorbox({open:true, href:'yourLink.xxx'}); Colorbox settings are now persistent and unique for each element. This allows for extremely flexible options for individual elements. You could use this to create a gallery in which each page in the gallery has different settings. One could be a photo with a fade transition, next could be an inline element with an elastic transition with a set width and height, etc. For user callbacks, 'this' now refers to the element colorbox was opened from. Fixed a minor grouping issue with IE6, when transition type is set to 'none'. Added an Adobe Illustrator file that contains the borders and buttons used in the various examples. Version 1.2 - May 13 2009 Added a slideshow feature. Added re-positioning on browser resize. If the browser is resized, Colorbox will recenter itself onscreen. Added hooks for key events: cbox_open, cbox_load, cbox_complete, cbox_closed. Fixed an IE transparency-stacking problem, where transparent PNGs would show through to the background overlay. Fixed an IE iframe issue where the ifame might shift up and to the left under certain circumstances. Fixed an IE6 bug where the loading overlay was not at full height. Removed the delay in switching between same-sized gallery content when using transitions. Changed how iframes are loaded to make it more compatible with iframed pages that use DOM dependent JavaScript. Changed how the JS is structured to be better organized and increase compression. Increased documentation. Changed CSS :hover states to a .hover class. This sidesteps a minor IE8 bug with css hover states and allows easier access to hover state user styles from the JavaScript. Changed: elements added to the DOM have new ID's. The naming is more consistent and less likely to cause conflicts with existing website stylesheets. All stylesheets have been updated. Changed the behavior for prev/next links so that Colorbox does not get hung up on broken links. A visitor can now skip through broken or long-loading links by clicking prev/next buttons. Changed the naming of variables in the parameter map to be more concise and intuitive. Removed colorbox.css. Combined the colorbox.css styles with jquery.colorbox.js: the css file was not large enough to warrant being a separate file. Version 1.1.6 - April 28 2009 Prevented the default action of the next & previous anchors and the left and right keys for gallery mode. Fixed a bug where the title element was being added back to the DOM when closing Colorbox while using inline content. Fixed a bug where IE7 would crash for example 2. Smaller filesize: removed a small amount of unused code and rewrote the HTML injection with less syntax. Added a public method for closing Colorbox: $.colorbox.close(). This will allow iframe users to add an event to close Colorbox without having to create an additional function. Version 1.1.5 - April 11 2009 Fixed minor issues with exiting Colorbox. Version 1.1.4 - April 08 2009 Fixed a bug in the fade transition where Colorbox not close completely if instructed to close during the fade-in portion of the transition. Version 1.1.3 - April 06 2009 Fixed an IE6&7 issue with using Colorbox to display animated GIFs. Version 1.1.2 - April 05 2009 Added ability to change content when Colorbox is already open. Added vertical photo centering now works for all browsers (this feature previously excluded IE6&7). Added namespacing to the esc-key keydown event for people who want to disable it: ""keydown.colorClose"" Added 'title' setting to add the ability to set an alternative title for any Colorbox call. Fixed rollover navigation issue with IE8. (Added JS-based rollover state due to a browser-bug.) Fixed an overflow issue for when the fixed width/height is smaller than the size of a photo. Fixed a bug in the fade transition where the border would still come up if Colorbox was closed mid-transition. Switch from JSMin to Yui Compressor for minification. Minified code now under 7KB. Version 1.1.1 - March 31 2009 More robust image detection regex. Now detects image file types with url fragments and/or query strings. Added 'nofollow' exception to rel grouping. Changed how images are loaded into the DOM to prevent premature size calculation by Colorbox. Added timestamp to iframe name to prevent caching - this was a problem in some browsers if the user had multiple iframes and the visitor left the page and came back, or if they refreshed the page. Version 1.1.0 - March 21 2009 Animation is now much smoother and less resource intensive. Added support for % sizing. Callback option added. Inline content now preserves JavaScript events, and changes made while Colorbox is open are also preserved. Added 'href' setting to add the ability to set an alternative href for any anchor, or to assign the Colorbox event to non-anchors. Example: $('button').colorbox({'href':'process.php'}) Example: $('a[href='http://msn.com']).colorbox({'href':'http://google.com', iframe:true}); Photos are now horizontally centered if they are smaller than the lightbox size. Also vertically centered for browsers newer than IE7. Buttons in the examples are now included in the 'protected zone'. The lightbox will never expand it's borders or buttons beyond an accessible area of the screen. Keypress events don't queue up by holding down the arrow keys. Added option to close Colorbox by clicking on the background overlay. Added 'none' transition setting. Changed 'contentIframe' and 'contentInline' to 'inline' and 'iframe'. Removed 'contentAjax' because it is automatically assumed for non-image file types. Changed 'contentWidth' and 'contentHeight' to 'fixedWidth' and 'fixedHeight'. These sizes now reflect the total size of the lightbox, not just the inner content. This is so users can accurately anticipate % sizes without fear of creating scrollbars. Clicking on a photo will now switch to the next photo in a set. Loading.gif is more stable in it's position. Added a minified version. Code passes JSLint. Version 1.0.5 - March 11 2009 Redo: Fixed a bug where IE would cut off the bottom portion of a photo, if the photo was larger than the document dimensions. Version 1.0.4 - March 10 2009 Added an option to allow users to automatically open the lightbox. Example usage: $("".colorbox"").colorbox({open:true}); Fixed a bug where IE would cut off the bottom portion of a photo, if the photo was larger than the document dimensions. Version 1.0.3 - March 09 2009 Fixed vertical centering for Safari 3.0.x. Version 1.0.2 - March 06 2009 Corrected a typo. Changed the content-type check so that it does not assume all links to photos should actually display photos. This allows for Ajax/inline/and iframe calls on anchors linking to picture file types. Version 1.0.1 - March 05 2009 Fixed keydown events (esc, left arrow, right arrow) for Webkit browsers.

More information and examples: http://www.fancyapps.com/fancybox/ License: http://www.fancyapps.com/fancybox/#license Copyright (c) 2012 Janis Skarnelis - janis@fancyapps.com How to use To get started, download the plugin, unzip it and copy files to your website/application directory. Load files in the section of your HTML document. Make sure you also add the jQuery library. <head>     <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js""></script>     <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""/fancybox/jquery.fancybox.css"" type=""text/css"" media=""screen"" />     <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/fancybox/jquery.fancybox.pack.js""></script> </head>  Create your links with a title (or data-fancybox-title) if you want a title to be shown, and add a class: <a href=""large_image.jpg"" class=""fancybox"" title=""Sample title""><img src=""small_image.jpg"" /></a>  If you have a set of related items that you would like to group, additionally include a group name in the rel (or data-fancybox-group) attribute: <a href=""large_1.jpg"" class=""fancybox"" rel=""gallery"" title=""Sample title 1""><img src=""small_1.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""large_2.jpg"" class=""fancybox"" rel=""gallery"" title=""Sample title 1""><img src=""small_2.jpg"" /></a>  Initialise the script like this: <script>     $(document).ready(function() {         $('.fancybox').fancybox();     }); </script>  May also be passed an optional options object which will extend the default values. Example: <script>     $(document).ready(function() {         $('.fancybox').fancybox({             padding : 0,             openEffect  : 'elastic',             closeBtn: false         });     }); </script>  Tip: Automatically group and apply fancyBox to all images: $(""a[href$='.jpg'],a[href$='.jpeg'],a[href$='.png'],a[href$='.gif']"").attr('rel', 'gallery').fancybox();  Script uses the href attribute of the matched elements to obtain the location of the content and to figure out content type you want to display. You can specify type directly by adding classname (fancybox.image, fancybox.iframe, etc) or data-fancybox-type attribute: //Ajax: <a href=""/example.html"" class=""fancybox fancybox.ajax"">Example</a> //or <a href=""/example.html"" class=""fancybox"" data-fancybox-type=""ajax"">Example</a>  //Iframe: <a href=""example.html"" class=""fancybox fancybox.iframe"">Example</a>  //Inline (will display an element with `id=""example""`) <a href=""#example"" class=""fancybox"">Example</a>  //SWF: <a href=""example.swf"" class=""fancybox"">Example</a>  //Image: <a href=""example.jpg"" class=""fancybox"">Example</a>  Note, ajax requests are subject to the same origin policy. If fancyBox will not be able to get content type, it will try to guess based on 'href' and will quit silently if would not succeed. (this is different from previsous versions where 'ajax' was used as default type or an error message was displayed). Advanced Helpers Helpers provide a simple mechanism to extend the capabilities of fancyBox. There are two built-in helpers - 'overlay' and 'title'. You can disable them, set custom options or enable other helpers. Examples: //Disable title helper $("".fancybox"").fancybox({     helpers:  {         title:  null     } });  //Disable overlay helper $("".fancybox"").fancybox({     helpers:  {         overlay : null     } });  //Change title position and overlay color $("".fancybox"").fancybox({     helpers:  {         title : {             type : 'inside'         },         overlay : {             css : {                 'background' : 'rgba(255,255,255,0.5)'             }         }     } });  //Enable thumbnail helper and set custom options $("".fancybox"").fancybox({     helpers:  {         thumbs : {             width: 50,             height: 50         }     } });  API Also available are event driven callback methods. The this keyword refers to the current or upcoming object (depends on callback method). Here is how you can change title: $("".fancybox"").fancybox({     beforeLoad : function() {         this.title = 'Image ' + (this.index + 1) + ' of ' + this.group.length + (this.title ? ' - ' + this.title : '');          /*             ""this.element"" refers to current element, so you can, for example, use the ""alt"" attribute of the image to store the title:             this.title = $(this.element).find('img').attr('alt');         */     } });  It`s possible to open fancyBox programmatically in various ways: //HTML content: $.fancybox( '<div><h1>Lorem Lipsum</h1><p>Lorem lipsum</p></div>', {     title : 'Custom Title' });  //DOM element: $.fancybox( $(""#inline""), {     title : 'Custom Title' });  //Custom object: $.fancybox({     href: 'example.jpg',     title : 'Custom Title' });  //Array of objects: $.fancybox([     {         href: 'example1.jpg',         title : 'Custom Title 1'     },     {         href: 'example2.jpg',         title : 'Custom Title 2'     } ], {     padding: 0 });  There are several methods that allow you to interact with and manipulate fancyBox, example: //Close fancybox: $.fancybox.close();  There is a simply way to access wrapping elements using JS: $.fancybox.wrap $.fancybox.skin $.fancybox.outer $.fancybox.inner  You can override CSS to customize the look. For example, make navigation arrows always visible, change width and move them outside of area (use this snippet after including fancybox.css): .fancybox-nav span {     visibility: visible; }  .fancybox-nav {     width: 80px; }  .fancybox-prev {     left: -80px; }  .fancybox-next {     right: -80px; }  In that case, you might want to increase space around box: $("".fancybox"").fancybox({     margin : [20, 60, 20, 60] });  Bug tracker Have a bug?

Demo: http://stephanwagner.me/jBox Docs: http://stephanwagner.me/jBox/documentation Tooltips You can use jQuery selectors to add tooltips to elements: $('.tooltip').jBox('Tooltip');  Now elements with class=""tooltip"" will open tooltips: <span class=""tooltip"" title=""My first tooltip"">Hover me!</span> <span class=""tooltip"" title=""My second tooltip"">Hover me!</span>  Modal windows You can set up modal windows the same way as tooltips. But most of times you'd want more variety, like a title or HTML content: new jBox('Modal', {     width: 300,     height: 200,     attach: $('#myModal'),     title: 'My Modal Window',     content: '<i>Hello there!</i>' });  <div id=""myModal"">Click me to open a modal window!</div>  Confirm windows Confirm windows are modal windows which requires the user to confirm a click action on an element. Give an element the attribute data-confirm to attach it: new jBox('Confirm', {     confirmButton: 'Do it!',     cancelButton: 'Nope' });  <div onclick=""doit()"" data-confirm=""Do you really want to do this?"">Click me!</div> <a href=""http://stephanwagner.me"" data-confirm=""Do you really want to leave this page?"">Click me!</a>  Notices A notice will open automatically and destroy itself after some time: new jBox('Notice', {     content: 'Hurray! A notice!' });  Images To create image modal windows you only need following few lines: new jBox('Image');  <a href=""/image-large.jpg"" data-jbox-image=""gallery1"" title=""My image""><img src=""/image.jpg"" alt=""""></a>  Learn more These few examples are very basic.

It does this using watcher objects, which watch an element and trigger events. Watcher objects also contain information about the element they watch, including the element's visibility and location relative to the viewport. The scroll monitor was designed to be very fast. On each scroll event the DOM is only touched twice, once to find the document height and again to find the viewport top. No variables are declared, nor are any objects, arrays, or strings created. The code is based on vanilla javascript and has no external dependencies. Except if you want to put it in the head of the document, then you'll need jQuery for the DOMContentLoaded event. Watchers are very cheap. Create them liberally. Basic Usage var scrollMonitor = require(""./scrollMonitor""); // if you're not using require, you can use the scrollMonitor global. var myElement = document.getElementById(""itemToWatch"");  var elementWatcher = scrollMonitor.create( myElement );  elementWatcher.enterViewport(function() {     console.log( 'I have entered the viewport' ); }); elementWatcher.exitViewport(function() {     console.log( 'I have left the viewport' ); }); Demos Stress Test - Test with as many watchers as you'd like Fixed Positioning and Locking Anchored section headers Complex sidebar behavior Watcher Objects Create watcher objects with scrollMonitor.create( watchItem ). An optional second argument lets you receive events before or after this element enters the viewport. See ""Offsets"". watchItem can be one of the following: DOM Element - the watcher will watch the area contained by the DOM element. Object - obj.top and obj.bottom will be used for watcher.top and watcher.bottom. Number - the watcher will watch a 1px area this many pixels from the top. Negative numbers will watch from the bottom. jQuery object - it will use the first DOM element. NodeList or Array - it will use the first DOM element. string - it will use the string as a CSS selector and watch the first match. Watchers are automatically recalculated on the first scroll event after the height of the document changes. Events Element watchers trigger six events: visibilityChange - when the element enters or exits the viewport. stateChange - similar to visibilityChange but is also called if the element goes from below the viewport to above it in one scroll event or when the element goes from partially to fully visible or vice versa. enterViewport - when the element enters the viewport. fullyEnterViewport - when the element is completely in the viewport [1]. exitViewport - when the element completely leaves the viewport. partiallyExitViewport - when the element goes from being fully in the viewport to only partially [2]. If the element is larger than the viewport fullyEnterViewport will be triggered when the element spans the entire viewport. If the element is larger than the viewport partiallyExitViewport will be triggered when the element no longer spans the entire viewport. Properties elementWatcher.isInViewport - true if any part of the element is visible, false if not. elementWatcher.isFullyInViewport - true if the entire element is visible [1]. elementWatcher.isAboveViewport - true if any part of the element is above the viewport. elementWatcher.isBelowViewport - true if any part of the element is below the viewport. elementWatcher.top - distance from the top of the document to the top of this watcher. elementWatcher.bottom - distance from the top of the document to the bottom of this watcher. elementWatcher.height - top - bottom. elementWatcher.watchItem - the element, number, or object that this watcher is watching. elementWatcher.offsets - an object that determines the offsets of this watcher. See ""Offsets"". If the element is larger than the viewport isFullyInViewport is true when the element spans the entire viewport. Methods elementWatcher.on/off/one - the standard event functions. elementWatcher.recalculateLocation - recalculates the location of the element in relation to the document. elementWatcher.destroy - removes this watcher and clears out its event listeners. elementWatcher.lock - locks this watcher at its current location. See ""Locking"". elementWatcher.unlock - unlocks this watcher. These methods are automatically called by the scrollMonitor, you should never need them: elementWatcher.update - updates the boolean properties in relation to the viewport. Does not trigger events. elementWatcher.triggerCallbacks - triggers any callbacks that need to be called. Locking Sometimes you want to change the element you're watching, but want to continue watching the original area. One common use case is setting position: fixed on an element when it exits the viewport, then removing positioning when it when it reenters. var watcher = scrollMonitor.create( $element ); watcher.lock(); // ensure that we're always watching the place the element originally was  watcher.exitViewport(function() {     $element.addClass('fixed'); }); watcher.enterViewport(function() {     $element.removeClass('fixed'); }); Because the watcher was locked on the second line, the scroll monitor will never recalculate its location. Offsets If you want to trigger an event when the edge of an element is near the edge of the viewport, you can use offsets. The offset is the second argument to scrollMonitor.create. This will trigger events when an element gets within 200px of the viewport: scrollMonitor.create( element, 200 ) This will trigger when the element is 200px inside the viewport: scrollMonitor.create( element, -200 ) If you only want it to affect the top and bottom differently you can send an object in.  scrollMonitor.create( element, {top: 200, bottom: 50}) If you only want it to affect the top and not the bottom you can use only one property in.  scrollMonitor.create( element, {top: 200}) scrollMonitor Module Methods scrollMonitor.create( watchItem, offsets ) - Returns a new watcher. watchItem is a DOM element, jQuery object, NodeList, CSS selector, object with .top and .bottom, or a number. scrollMonitor.update() - update and trigger all watchers. scrollMonitor.recalculateLocations() - recalculate the location of all unlocked watchers and trigger if needed. Properties scrollMonitor.viewportTop - distance from the top of the document to the top of the viewport. scrollMonitor.viewportBottom - distance from the top of the document to the bottom of the viewport. scrollMonitor.viewportHeight - height of the viewport. scrollMonitor.documentHeight - height of the document.

Hide your header until you need it. What's it all about? Headroom.js is a lightweight, high-performance JS widget (with no dependencies!) that allows you to react to the user's scroll. The header on this site is a living example, it slides out of view when scrolling down and slides back in when scrolling up. Why use it? Fixed headers are a popular approach for keeping the primary navigation in close proximity to the user. This can reduce the effort required for a user to quickly navigate a site, but they are not without problems… Large screens are usually landscape-oriented, meaning less vertical than horizontal space. A fixed header can therefore occupy a significant portion of the content area. Small screens are typically used in a portrait orientation. Whilst this results in more vertical space, because of the overall height of the screen a meaningfully-sized header can still be quite imposing. Headroom.js allows you to bring elements into view when appropriate, and give focus to your content the rest of the time. How does it work? At it's most basic headroom.js simply adds and removes CSS classes from an element in response to a scroll event. This means you must supply your own CSS styles separately. The classes that are used in headroom.js that are added and removed are: <!-- initially --> <header class=""headroom"">  <!-- scrolling down --> <header class=""headroom headroom--unpinned"">  <!-- scrolling up --> <header class=""headroom headroom--pinned""> Relying on CSS classes affords headroom.js incredible flexibility. The choice of what to do when scrolling up or down is now entirely yours - anything you can do with CSS you can do in response to the user's scroll. Usage Using headroom.js is really simple. It has a pure JS API, plus an optional jQuery/Zepto plugin and AngularJS directive. Install with npm npm install headroom.js --save Install with bower bower install https://npmcdn.com/headroom.js/bower.zip --save Using Headroom.js with a CDN A universal build (suitable for script tags, CommonJS, and AMD) is available from npmcdn.com: https://npmcdn.com/headroom.js With pure JS Include the headroom.js script in your page, and then: // grab an element var myElement = document.querySelector(""header""); // construct an instance of Headroom, passing the element var headroom  = new Headroom(myElement); // initialise headroom.init(); With jQuery/Zepto Include the headroom.js and jQuery.headroom.js scripts in your page, and then: // simple as this! // NOTE: init() is implicitly called with the plugin $(""header"").headroom(); The plugin also offers a data-* API if you prefer a declarative approach. <!-- selects $(""[data-headroom]"") --> <header data-headroom> Note: Zepto's additional data module is required for compatibility. With AngularJS Include the headroom.js and angular.headroom.js scripts in your page, and include the Headroom module angular.module('app', [ // your requires 'headroom' ]); And then use the directive in your markup: <header headroom></header> <!-- or --> <headroom></headroom> <!-- or with options --> <headroom tolerance='0' offset='0' scroller="".my-scroller"" classes=""{pinned:'headroom--pinned',unpinned:'headroom--unpinned',initial:'headroom'}""></headroom> Note: in AngularJS, you cannot pass a DOM element as a directive attribute. Instead, you have to provide a selector that can be passed to angular.element. If you use default AngularJS jQLite selector engine, here are the compliant selectors. Options Headroom.js can also accept an options object to alter the way it behaves. You can see the default options by inspecting Headroom.options. The structure of an options object is as follows: {     // vertical offset in px before element is first unpinned     offset : 0,     // scroll tolerance in px before state changes     tolerance : 0,     // or scroll tolerance per direction     tolerance : {         down : 0,         up : 0     },     // element which is source of scroll events. Defaults to window     scroller : element,     // css classes to apply     classes : {         // when element is initialised         initial : ""headroom"",         // when scrolling up         pinned : ""headroom--pinned"",         // when scrolling down         unpinned : ""headroom--unpinned"",         // when above offset         top : ""headroom--top"",         // when below offset         notTop : ""headroom--not-top"",         // when at bottom of scoll area         bottom : ""headroom--bottom"",         // when not at bottom of scroll area         notBottom : ""headroom--not-bottom""     },     // callback when pinned, `this` is headroom object     onPin : function() {},     // callback when unpinned, `this` is headroom object     onUnpin : function() {},     // callback when above offset, `this` is headroom object     onTop : function() {},     // callback when below offset, `this` is headroom object     onNotTop : function() {}     // callback at bottom of page, `this` is headroom object     onBottom : function() {},     // callback when moving away from bottom of page, `this` is headroom object     onNotBottom : function() {} } Examples Head over to the headroom.js playroom if you want see some example usages. There you can tweak all of headroom's options and apply different CSS effects in an interactive demo. Browser support Headroom.js is dependent on the following browser APIs: requestAnimationFrame classList Function.prototype.bind All of these APIs are capable of being polyfilled, so headroom.js can work with less-capable browsers if desired. Check the linked resources above to determine if you must polyfill to achieve your desired level of browser support. Contributions & Issues Contributions are welcome.

Direction options, more hotkeys, more fixes Jun 4, 2014 README.md One Page Scroll 1.3.1 by Pete R. Create an Apple-like one page scroll website (iPhone 5S website) with One Page Scroll plugin Created by Pete R., Founder of BucketListly License: Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Requirement jQuery (1.9.0 or later) note: jQuery 1.9.0 or later is strongly recommended because using jQuery less than 1.8.3 and jquery.onepage-scroll.js together turns out to be a hash-based XSS vulnerabiliry. see: http://jsfiddle.net/33WJx/ Demo View demo Compatibility Modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both desktop and smartphones have been tested. Should work fine on IE8 and IE9 as well. Basic Usage One Page Scroll let you transform your website into a one page scroll website that allows users to scroll one page at a time. It is perfect for creating a website in which you want to present something to the viewers. For example, Apple's iPhone 5S website uses the same technique. To add this to your website, simply include the latest jQuery library together with jquery.onepage-scroll.js, onepage-scroll.css into your document's <head> and call the function as follows: <body>   ...   <div class=""main"">     <section>...</section>     <section>...</section>     ...   </div>   ... </body> Container ""Main"" must be one level below the body tag in order to make it work full page. Now call the function to activate as follows: $("".main"").onepage_scroll({    sectionContainer: ""section"",     // sectionContainer accepts any kind of selector in case you don't want to use section    easing: ""ease"",                  // Easing options accepts the CSS3 easing animation such ""ease"", ""linear"", ""ease-in"",                                     // ""ease-out"", ""ease-in-out"", or even cubic bezier value such as ""cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.420, 1.310)""    animationTime: 1000,             // AnimationTime let you define how long each section takes to animate    pagination: true,                // You can either show or hide the pagination. Toggle true for show, false for hide.    updateURL: false,                // Toggle this true if you want the URL to be updated automatically when the user scroll to each page.    beforeMove: function(index) {},  // This option accepts a callback function. The function will be called before the page moves.    afterMove: function(index) {},   // This option accepts a callback function. The function will be called after the page moves.    loop: false,                     // You can have the page loop back to the top/bottom when the user navigates at up/down on the first/last page.    keyboard: true,                  // You can activate the keyboard controls    responsiveFallback: false,        // You can fallback to normal page scroll by defining the width of the browser in which                                     // you want the responsive fallback to be triggered. For example, set this to 600 and whenever                                     // the browser's width is less than 600, the fallback will kick in.    direction: ""vertical""            // You can now define the direction of the One Page Scroll animation. Options available are ""vertical"" and ""horizontal"". The default value is ""vertical"".   }); And that's it. Now, your website should work the same way Apple's iPhone 5S website does. You should be able to swipe up/down as well (thanks to Eike Send for his swipe events!) when viewing your website on mobile phones. Keyboard Shortcuts You can trigger page move with hotkeys as well: Up arrow / Page Up Pressing the up arrow or the page up key allows you to move the page up by one. Down arrow / Page Donw Pressing the down arrow or the page down key allows you to move the page down by one. Spacebar Pressing the space key allows you to move the page down by one. Home Pressing the home key brings you back to the first page. End Pressing the end key brings you to the last page. Public Methods You can also trigger page move programmatically as well: $.fn.moveUp() This method allows you to move the page up by one. This action is equivalent to scrolling up/swiping down.   $("".main"").moveUp(); $.fn.moveDown() This method allows you to move the page down by one. This action is equivalent to scrolling down/swiping up.   $("".main"").moveDown(); $.fn.moveTo(page_index) This method allows you to move to the specified page index programatically.   $("".main"").moveTo(3); Callbacks You can use callbacks to perform actions before or after the page move. beforeMove(current_page_index) This callback gets called before the plugin performs its move.   $("".main"").onepage_scroll({     beforeMove: function(index) {       ...     }   }); afterMove(next_page_index) This callback gets called after the move animation was performed.   $("".main"").onepage_scroll({     afterMove: function(index) {       ...     }   }); If you want to see more of my plugins, visit The Pete Design, or follow me on Twitter and Github.

It works on desktop, mobile and smart TV. It has been vigorously optimized for performance and size so to offer the smoothest result on modern and old devices alike. iScroll does not just scroll. It can handle any element that needs to be moved with user interaction. It adds scrolling, zooming, panning, infinite scrolling, parallax scrolling, carousels to your projects and manages to do that in just 4kb. Give it a broom and it will also clean up your office. Even on platforms where native scrolling is good enough, iScroll adds features that wouldn't be possible otherwise. Specifically: Granular control over the scroll position, even during momentum. You can always get and set the x,y coordinates of the scroller. Animation can be customized with user defined easing functions (bounce, elastic, back, ...). You can easily hook to a plethora of custom events (onBeforeScrollStart, onScrollStart, onScroll, onScrollEnd, flick, ...). Out of the box multi-platform support. From older Android devices to the latest iPhone, from Chrome to Internet Explorer. The many faces of iScroll iScroll is all about optimization. To reach the highest performance it has been divided into multiple versions. You can pick the version that better suits your need. Currently we have the following fragrances: iscroll.js, it is the general purpose script. It includes the most commonly used features and grants very high performance in a small footprint. iscroll-lite.js, it is a stripped down version of the main script. It doesn't support snap, scrollbars, mouse wheel, key bindings. But if all you need is scrolling (especially on mobile) iScroll lite is the smallest, fastest solution. iscroll-probe.js, probing the current scroll position is a demanding task, that's why I decided to build a dedicated version for it. If you need to know the scrolling position at any given time, this is the iScroll for you. (I'm making some more tests, this might end up in the regular iscroll.js script, so keep an eye on it). iscroll-zoom.js, adds zooming to the standard scroll. iscroll-infinite.js, can do infinite and cached scrolling. Handling very long lists of elements is no easy task for mobile devices. iScroll infinite uses a caching mechanism that lets you scroll a potentially infinite number of elements. Getting started So you want to be an iScroll master. Cool, because that is what I'll make you into. The best way to learn the iScroll is by looking at the demos. In the archive you'll find a demo folder stuffed with examples. Most of the script features are outlined there. IScroll is a class that needs to be initiated for each scrolling area. There's no limit to the number of iScrolls you can have in each page if not that imposed by the device CPU/Memory. Try to keep the DOM as simple as possible. iScroll uses the hardware compositing layer but there's a limit to the elements the hardware can handle. The optimal HTML structure is: <div id=""wrapper"">     <ul>         <li>...</li>         <li>...</li>         ...     </ul> </div> iScroll must be applied to the wrapper of the scrolling area. In the above example the UL element will be scrolled. Only the first child of the container element is scrolled, additional children are simply ignored. box-shadow, opacity, text-shadow and alpha channels are all properties that don't go very well together with hardware acceleration. Scrolling might look good with few elements but as soon as your DOM becomes more complex you'll start experiencing lag and jerkiness. Sometimes a background image to simulate the shadow performs better than box-shadow. The bottom line is: experiment with CSS properties, you'll be surprised by the difference in performance a small CSS change can do. The minimal call to initiate the script is as follow: <script type=""text/javascript""> var myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper'); </script> The first parameter can be a string representing the DOM selector of the scroll container element OR a reference to the element itself. The following is a valid syntax too: var wrapper = document.getElementById('wrapper'); var myScroll = new IScroll(wrapper); So basically either you pass the element directly or a string that will be given to querySelector. Consequently to select a wrapper by its class name instead of the ID, you'd do: var myScroll = new IScroll('.wrapper'); Note that iScroll uses querySelector not querySelectorAll, so only the first occurrence of the selector is used. If you need to apply iScroll to multiple objects you'll have to build your own cycle. You don't strictly need to assign the instance to a variable (myScroll), but it is handy to keep a reference to the iScroll. For example you could later check the scroller position or unload unnecessary events when you don't need the iScroll anymore. Initialization The iScroll needs to be initiated when the DOM is ready. The safest bet is to start it on window onload event. DOMContentLoaded or inline initialization are also fine but remember that the script needs to know the height/width of the scrolling area. If you have images that don't have explicit width/height declaration, iScroll will most likely end up with a wrong scroller size. Add position:relative or absolute to the scroll container (the wrapper). That alone usually solves most of the problems with wrongly calculated wrapper dimensions. To sum up, the smallest iScroll configuration is: <head> ... <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""iscroll.js""></script> <script type=""text/javascript""> var myScroll; function loaded() {     myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper'); } </script> </head> ... <body onload=""loaded()""> <div id=""wrapper"">     <ul>         <li>...</li>         <li>...</li>         ...     </ul> </div> </body> Refer to the barebone example for more details on the minimal CSS/HTML requirements. If you have a complex DOM it is sometimes smart to add a little delay from the onload event to iScroll initialization. Executing the iScroll with a 100 or 200 milliseconds delay gives the browser that little rest that can save your ass. Configuring the iScroll iScroll can be configured by passing a second parameter during the initialization phase. var myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper', {     mouseWheel: true,     scrollbars: true }); The example above turns on mouse wheel support and scrollbars. After initialization you can access the normalized values from the options object. Eg: console.dir(myScroll.options); The above will return the configuration the myScroll instance will run on. By normalized I mean that if you set useTransform:true (for example) but the browser doesn't support CSS transforms, useTransform will be false. Understanding the core iScroll uses various techniques to scroll based on device/browser capability. Normally you don't need to configure the engine, iScroll is smart enough to pick the best for you. Nonetheless it is important to understand which mechanisms iScroll works on and how to configure them. options.useTransform By default the engine uses the transform CSS property. Setting this to false scrolls like we were in 2007, ie: using the top/left (and thus the scroller needs to be absolutely positioned). This might be useful when scrolling sensitive content such as Flash, iframes and videos, but be warned: performance loss is huge. Default: true options.useTransition iScroll uses CSS transition to perform animations (momentum and bounce). By setting this to false, requestAnimationFrame is used instead. On modern browsers the difference is barely noticeable. On older devices transitions perform better. Default: true options.HWCompositing This option tries to put the scroller on the hardware layer by appending translateZ(0) to the transform CSS property. This greatly increases performance especially on mobile, but there are situations where you might want to disable it (notably if you have too many elements and the hardware can't catch up). Default: true If unsure leave iScroll decide what's the optimal config. For best performance all the above options should be set to true (or better leave them undefined as they are set to true automatically). You may try to play with them in case you encounter hiccups and memory leaks. Basic features options.bounce When the scroller meets the boundary it performs a small bounce animation. Disabling bounce may help reach smoother results on old or slow devices. Default: true options.click To override the native scrolling iScroll has to inhibit some default browser behaviors, such as mouse clicks. If you want your application to respond to the click event you have to explicitly set this option to true. Please note that it is suggested to use the custom tap event instead (see below). Default: false options.disableMouse options.disablePointer options.disableTouch By default iScroll listens to all pointer events and reacts to the first one that occurs. It may seem a waste of resources but feature detection has proven quite unreliable and this listen-to-all approach is our safest bet for wide browser/device compatibility. If you have an internal mechanism for device detection or you know in advance where your script will run on, you may want to disable all event sets you don't need (mouse, pointer or touch events). For example to disable mouse and pointer events: var myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper', {     disableMouse: true,     disablePointer: true }); Default: false options.eventPassthrough Sometimes you want to preserve native vertical scroll but being able to add an horizontal iScroll (maybe a carousel). Set this to true and the iScroll area will react to horizontal swipes only. Vertical swipes will naturally scroll the whole page. See event passthrough demo on a mobile device. Note that this can be set to 'horizontal' to inverse the behavior (native horizontal scroll, vertical iScroll). options.freeScroll This is useful mainly on 2D scrollers (when you need to scroll both horizontally and vertically). Normally when you start scrolling in one direction the other is locked. Sometimes you just want to move freely with no constrains. In these cases you can set this option to true. See 2D scroll demo. Default: false options.keyBindings Set this to true to activate keyboard (and remote controls) interaction. See the Key bindings section below for more information. Default: false options.invertWheelDirection Meaningful when mouse wheel support is activated, in which case it just inverts the scrolling direction. (ie. going down scrolls up and vice-versa). Default: false options.momentum You can turn on/off the momentum animation performed when the user quickly flicks on screen. Turning this off greatly enhance performance. Default: true options.mouseWheel Listen to the mouse wheel event. Default: false options.preventDefault Whether or not to preventDefault() when events are fired. This should be left true unless you really know what you are doing. See preventDefaultException in the Advanced features for more control over the preventDefault behavior. Default: true options.scrollbars Wheter or not to display the default scrollbars. See more in the Scrollbar section. Default: false. options.scrollX options.scrollY By default only vertical scrolling is enabled. If you need to scroll horizontally you have to set scrollX to true. See horizontal demo. See also the freeScroll option. Default: scrollX: false, scrollY: true Note that scrollX/Y: true has the same effect as overflow: auto. Setting one direction to false helps to spare some checks and thus CPU cycles. options.startX options.startY By default iScroll starts at 0, 0 (top left) position, you can instruct the scroller to kickoff at a different location. Default: 0 options.tap Set this to true to let iScroll emit a custom tap event when the scroll area is clicked/tapped but not scrolled. This is the suggested way to handle user interaction with clickable elements. To listen to the tap event you would add an event listener as you would do for a standard event. Example: element.addEventListener('tap', doSomething, false); \\ Native $('#element').on('tap', doSomething); \\ jQuery You can also customize the event name by passing a string. Eg: tap: 'myCustomTapEvent' In this case you'd listen to myCustomTapEvent. Default: false Scrollbars The scrollbars are more than just what the name suggests. In fact internally they are referenced as indicators. An indicator listens to the scroller position and normally it just shows its position in relation to whole, but what it can do is so much more. Let's start with the basis. options.scrollbars As we mentioned in the Basic features section there's only one thing that you got to do to activate the scrollbars in all their splendor, and that one thing is: var myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper', {     scrollbars: true }); Of course the default behavior can be personalized. options.fadeScrollbars When not in use the scrollbar fades away. Leave this to false to spare resources. Default: false options.interactiveScrollbars The scrollbar becomes draggable and user can interact with it. Default: false options.resizeScrollbars The scrollbar size changes based on the proportion between the wrapper and the scroller width/height. Setting this to false makes the scrollbar a fixed size. This might be useful in case of custom styled scrollbars (see below). Default: true options.shrinkScrollbars When scrolling outside of the boundaries the scrollbar is shrunk by a small amount. Valid values are: 'clip' and 'scale'. 'clip' just moves the indicator outside of its container, the impression is that the scrollbar shrinks but it is simply moving out of the screen. If you can live with the visual effect this option immensely improves overall performance. 'scale' turns off useTransition hence all animations are served with requestAnimationFrame. The indicator is actually varied in size and the end result is nicer to the eye. Default: false Note that resizing can't be performed by the GPU, so scale is all on the CPU. If your application runs on multiple devices my suggestion would be to switch this option to 'scale', 'clip' or false based on the platform responsiveness (eg: on older mobile devices you could set this to 'clip' and on desktop browser to 'scale'). See the scrollbar demo. Styling the scrollbar So you don't like the default scrollbar styling and you think you could do better. Help yourself! iScroll makes dressing the scrollbar a snap. First of all set the scrollbars option to 'custom': var myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper', {     scrollbars: 'custom' }); Then use the following CSS classes to style the little bastards. .iScrollHorizontalScrollbar, this is applied to the horizontal container. The element that actually hosts the scrollbar indicator. .iScrollVerticalScrollbar, same as above but for the vertical container. .iScrollIndicator, the actual scrollbar indicator. .iScrollBothScrollbars, this is added to the container elements when both scrollbars are shown. Normally just one (horizontal or vertical) is visible. The styled scrollbars demo should make things clearer than my lousy explanation. If you set resizeScrollbars: false you could make the scrollbar of a fixed size, otherwise it would be resized based on the scroller length. Please keep reading to the following section for a revelation that will shake your world. Indicators All the scrollbar options above are in reality just wrappers to the low level indicators option. It looks more or less like this: var myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper', {     indicators: {         el: [element|element selector]         fade: false,         ignoreBoundaries: false,         interactive: false,         listenX: true,         listenY: true,         resize: true,         shrink: false,         speedRatioX: 0,         speedRatioY: 0,     } }); options.indicators.el This is a mandatory parameter which holds a reference to the scrollbar container element. The first child inside the container will be the indicator. Note that the scrollbar can be anywhere on your document, it doesn't need to be inside the scroller wrapper. Do you start perceiving the power of such tool? Valid syntax would be: indicators: {     el: document.getElementById('indicator') } Or simply: indicators: {     el: '#indicator' } options.indicators.ignoreBoundaries This tells the indicator to ignore the boundaries imposed by its container. Since we can alter the speed ratio of the scrollbar, it is useful to just let the scrollbar go. Say you want the indicator to go twice as fast as the scroller, it would reach the end of its run very quickly. This option is used for parallax scrolling. Default: false options.indicators.listenX options.indicators.listenY To which axis the indicator listens to. It can be just one or both. Default: true options.indicators.speedRatioX options.indicators.speedRatioY The speed the indicator moves in relation to the main scroller size. By default this is set automatically. You rarely need to alter this value. Default: 0 options.indicators.fade options.indicators.interactive options.indicators.resize options.indicators.shrink These are the same options we explored in the scrollbars section, I'm not going to insult your intelligence and repeat them here. Do not cross the streams. It would be bad! Do not mix the scrollbars syntax (options.scrollbars, options.fadeScrollbars, options.interactiveScrollbars, ...) with the indicators! Use one or the other. Have a look at the minimap demo to get a glance at the power of the indicators option. The wittiest of you would have noticed that indicators is actually plural... Yes, exactly, passing an array of objects you can have a virtually infinite number of indicators. I don't know what you may need them for, but hey! who am I to argue about your scrollbar preferences? Parallax scrolling Parallax scrolling is just a collateral damage of the Indicators functionality. An indicator is just a layer that follows the movement and animation applied to the main scroller. If you see it like that you'll understand the power behind this feature. To this add that you can have any number of indicators and the parallax scrolling is served. Please refer to the parallax demo. Scrolling programmatically You silly! Of course you can scroll programmaticaly! scrollTo(x, y, time, easing) Say your iScroll instance resides into the myScroll variable. You can easily scroll to any position with the following syntax: myScroll.scrollTo(0, -100); That would scroll down by 100 pixels. Remember: 0 is always the top left corner. To scroll you have to pass negative numbers. time and easing are optional. They regulates the duration (in ms) and the easing function of the animation respectively. The easing functions are available in the IScroll.utils.ease object. For example to apply a 1 second elastic easing you'd do: myScroll.scrollTo(0, -100, 1000, IScroll.utils.ease.elastic); The available options are: quadratic, circular, back, bounce, elastic. scrollBy(x, y, time, easing) Same as above but X and Y are relative to the current position. myScroll.scrollBy(0, -10); Would scroll 10 pixels down. If you are at -100, you'll end up at -110. scrollToElement(el, time, offsetX, offsetY, easing) You're gonna like this. Sit tight. The only mandatory parameter is el. Pass an element or a selector and iScroll will try to scroll to the top/left of that element. time is optional and sets the animation duration. offsetX and offsetY define an offset in pixels, so that you can scroll to that element plus a the specified offset. Not only that. If you set them to true the element will be centered on screen. Refer to the scroll to element example. easing works the same way as per the scrollTo method. Snap iScroll can snap to fixed positions and elements. options.snap The simplest snap config is as follow: var myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper', {     snap: true }); This would automatically split the scroller into pages the size of the container. snap also takes a string as a value. The string will be the selector to the elements the scroller will be snapped to. So the following var myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper', {     snap: 'li' }); would snap to each and every LI tag. To help you navigate through the snap points iScroll grants access to a series of interesting methods. goToPage(x, y, time, easing) x and y represent the page number you want to scroll to in the horizontal or vertical axes (yeah, it's the plural of axis, I checked). If the scroller in mono-dimensional, just pass 0 to the axis you don't need. time is the duration of the animation, easing the easing function used to scroll to the point. Refer to the option.bounceEasing in the Advanced features. They are both optional. myScroll.goToPage(10, 0, 1000); This would scroll to the 10th page on the horizontal axis in 1 second. next() prev() Go to the next and previous page based on current position. Zoom To use the pinch/zoom functionality you better use the iscroll-zoom.js script. options.zoom Set this to true to activate zoom. Default: false options.zoomMax Maximum zoom level. Default: 4 options.zoomMin Minimum zoom level. Default: 1 options.startZoom Starting zoom level. Default: 1 options.wheelAction Wheel action can be set to 'zoom' to have the wheel regulate the zoom level instead of scrolling position. Default: undefined (ie: the mouse wheel scrolls) To sum up, a nice zoom config would be: myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper', {     zoom: true,     mouseWheel: true,     wheelAction: 'zoom' }); The zoom is performed with CSS transform. iScroll can zoom only on browsers that support that. Some browsers (notably webkit based ones) take a snapshot of the zooming area as soon as they are placed on the hardware compositing layer (say as soon as you apply a transform to them). This snapshot is used as a texture for the zooming area and it can hardly be updated. This means that your texture will be based on elements at scale 1 and zooming in will result in blurred, low definition text and images. A simple solution is to load content at double (or triple) its actual resolution and scale it down inside a scale(0.5) div. This should be enough to grant you a better result. I hope to be able to post more demos soon Refer to the zoom demo. zoom(scale, x, y, time) Juicy method that lets you zoom programmatically. scale is the zoom factor. x and y the focus point, aka the center of the zoom. If not specified, the center of the screen will be used. time is the duration of the animation in milliseconds (optional). Infinite scrolling iScroll integrates a smart caching system that allows to handle of a virtually infinite amount of data using (and reusing) just a bunch of elements. Infinite scrolling is in an early stage of development and although it can be considered stable, it is not ready for wide consumption. Please review the infinite demo and send your suggestions and bug reports. I will add more details as soon as the functionality evolves. Advanced options For the hardcore developer. options.bindToWrapper The move event is normally bound to the document and not the scroll container. When you move the cursor/finger out of the wrapper the scrolling keeps going. This is usually what you want, but you can also bind the move event to wrapper itself. Doing so as soon as the pointer leaves the container the scroll stops. Default: false options.bounceEasing Easing function performed during the bounce animation. Valid values are: 'quadratic', 'circular', 'back', 'bounce', 'elastic'. See the bounce easing demo, drag the scroller down and release. bounceEasing is a bit smarter than that. You can also feed a custom easing function, like so: bounceEasing: {     style: 'cubic-bezier(0,0,1,1)',     fn: function (k) { return k; } } The above would perform a linear easing. The style option is used every time the animation is executed with CSS transitions, fn is used with requestAnimationFrame. If the easing function is too complex and can't be represented by a cubic bezier just pass '' (empty string) as style. Note that bounce and elastic can't be performed by CSS transitions. Default: 'circular' options.bounceTime Duration in millisecond of the bounce animation. Default: 600 options.deceleration This value can be altered to change the momentum animation duration/speed. Higher numbers make the animation shorter. Sensible results can be experienced starting with a value of 0.01, bigger than that basically doesn't make any momentum at all. Default: 0.0006 options.mouseWheelSpeed Set the speed of the mouse wheel. Default: 20 options.preventDefaultException These are all the exceptions when preventDefault() would be fired anyway despite the preventDefault option value. This is a pretty powerful option, if you don't want to preventDefault() on all elements with formfield class name for example, you could pass the following: preventDefaultException: { className: /(^|\s)formfield(\s|$)/ } Default: { tagName: /^(INPUT|TEXTAREA|BUTTON|SELECT)$/ }. options.resizePolling When you resize the window iScroll has to recalculate elements position and dimension. This might be a pretty daunting task for the poor little fella. To give it some rest the polling is set to 60 milliseconds. By reducing this value you get better visual effect but the script becomes more aggressive on the CPU. The default value seems a good compromise. Default: 60 Mastering the refresh method iScroll needs to know the exact dimensions of both the wrapper and the scroller. They are computed at start up but if your elements change in size, we need to tell iScroll that you are messing with the DOM. This is achieved by calling the refresh method with the right timing. Please follow me closely, understanding this will save you hours of frustration. Every time you touch the DOM the browser renderer repaints the page. Once this repaint has happened we can safely read the new DOM properties. The repaint phase is not instantaneous and it happens only at the end of the scope that triggered it. That's why we need to give the renderer a little rest before refreshing the iScroll. To ensure that javascript gets the updated properties you should defer the refresh with something like this: ajax('page.php', onCompletion);  function onCompletion () {     // Update here your DOM      setTimeout(function () {         myScroll.refresh();     }, 0); }; We have placed the refresh() call into a zero timeout. That is likely all you need to correctly refresh the iScroll boundaries. There are other ways to wait for the repaint, but the zero-timeout has proven pretty solid. Consider that if you have a very complex HTML structure you may give the browser some more rest and raise the timeout to 100 or 200 milliseconds. This is generally true for all the tasks that have to be done on the DOM. Always give the renderer some rest. Custom events iScroll also emits some useful custom events you can hook to. To register them you use the on(type, fn) method. myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper'); myScroll.on('scrollEnd', doSomething); The above code executes the doSomething function every time the content stops scrolling. The available types are: beforeScrollStart, executed as soon as user touches the screen but before the scrolling has initiated. scrollCancel, scroll initiated but didn't happen. scrollStart, the scroll started. scroll, the content is scrolling. Available only in scroll-probe.js edition. See onScroll event. scrollEnd, content stopped scrolling. flick, user flicked left/right. zoomStart, user started zooming. zoomEnd, zoom ended. onScroll event The scroll event is available on iScroll probe edition only (iscroll-probe.js). The probe behavior can be altered through the probeType option. options.probeType This regulates the probe aggressiveness or the frequency at which the scroll event is fired. Valid values are: 1, 2, 3. The higher the number the more aggressive the probe. The more aggressive the probe the higher the impact on the CPU. probeType: 1 has no impact on performance. The scroll event is fired only when the scroller is not busy doing its stuff. probeType: 2 always executes the scroll event except during momentum and bounce. This resembles the native onScroll event. probeType: 3 emits the scroll event with a to-the-pixel precision. Note that the scrolling is forced to requestAnimationFrame (ie: useTransition:false). Please see the probe demo. Key bindings You can activate support for keyboards and remote controls with the keyBindings option. By default iScroll listens to the arrow keys, page up/down, home/end but they are (wait for it) totally customizable. You can pass an object with the list of key codes you want iScroll to react to. The default values are as follow: keyBindings: {     pageUp: 33,     pageDown: 34,     end: 35,     home: 36,     left: 37,     up: 38,     right: 39,     down: 40 } You can also pass a string (eg: pageUp: 'a') and iScroll will convert it for you. You could just think of a key code and iScroll would read it out of your mind. Useful scroller info iScroll stores many useful information that you can use to augment your application. You will probably find useful: myScroll.x/y, current position myScroll.directionX/Y, last direction (-1 down/right, 0 still, 1 up/left) myScroll.currentPage, current snap point info These pieces of information may be useful when dealing with custom events. Eg: myScroll = new IScroll('#wrapper'); myScroll.on('scrollEnd', function () {     if ( this.x < -1000 ) {         // do something     } }); The above executes some code if the x position is lower than -1000px when the scroller stops. Note that I used this instead of myScroll, you can use both of course, but iScroll passes itself as this context when firing custom event functions. Destroy The public destroy() method can be used to free some memory when the iScroll is not needed anymore. myScroll.destroy(); myScroll = null; Contributing and CLA If you want to contribute to the iScroll development, before I can accept your submission I have to ask you to sign the Contributor License Agreement. Unfortunately that is the only way to enforce the openness of the script. As an end user you have to do nothing of course. Actually the CLA ensures that nobody will even come after you asking for your first born for using the iScroll. Please note that pull requests may take some time to be accepted. Testing iScroll is one of the most time consuming tasks of the project. iScroll works from desktop to smartphone, from tablets to smart TVs. I do not have physical access to all the testing devices, so before I can push a change I have to make sure that the new code is working everywhere. Critical bugs are usually applied very quickly, but enhancements and coding style changes have to pass a longer review phase. Remember that this is still a side project for me. Who is using iScroll It's impossible to track all the websites and applications that use the iScroll. It has been spotted on: Apple, Microsoft, People, LinkedIn, IKEA, Nike, Playboy, Bose, and countless others.

Please consider this before using skrollr in production as problems with new browser versions, especially on mobile, will most definitely surface. To be honest, mobile support always sucked (because mobile browsers are hard) and you shouldn't compromise UX for some fancy UI effects. Ever. skrollr 0.6.30 Stand-alone parallax scrolling JavaScript library for mobile (Android, iOS, etc.) and desktop in about 12k minified. Designer friendly. No JavaScript skills needed. Just plain CSS and HTML. Actually, skrollr is much more than ""just"" parallax scrolling. It's a full-fledged scrolling animation library. In fact, you can use it and still have no parallax scrolling at all. But I wanted to sound hip and use some buzz-words. By the way, skrollr leverages HTML5 and CSS3 ;-) Resources Plugins Official skrollr-menu - Hash navigation skrollr-ie - IE < 9 CSS fixes skrollr-stylesheets - Keyframes inside CSS files Third party skrollr-colors - Mix and match hex, rgb and hsl colors. skrollr-decks - Fullpage presentation decks. In the wild Check out the wiki page for websites using skrollr and feel free to add your own website :). You can also shamelessly add yourself to the list here if you are offering paid skrollr support. Further resources (tutorials etc.) Moved to the wiki. Documentation First of all: look at the examples and read the source ;-). This might give you a feeling of how stuff works and you can see how some patterns can be implemented. Abstract skrollr allows you to animate any CSS property of any element depending on the horizontal scrollbar position. All you need to do is define key frames for each element at certain points in top scroll offset. Other libraries require you to write JavaScript in order to define your animations. This introduces two main problems: Animation and element are not at one place. In order to find out if any animations are defined for a given element, you have to scroll through many (sometimes thousands) of lines of JavaScript. You have to learn a new syntax which is often very verbose and limited at the same time. With skrollr, you put the definition of your key frames right where they belong (to the element) using a syntax you already know (plain CSS). If you would rather have the keyframes inside a separate file, take a look at skrollr-stylesheets. If you prefer to use JavaScript to define your animations make sure to take a look at ScrollMagic. It depends on both jQuery and the Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP) and gives you full control over every detail of your animations. Let's get serious First of all you want to include the skrollr.min.js file at the bottom of your document (right before the closing </body>) and then call skrollr.init(). Or you can place it inside the <head> if you want to, but make sure to call init() once the document has been loaded (e.g. jQuery's ready event or even window.onload).     <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""skrollr.min.js""></script>     <script type=""text/javascript"">     var s = skrollr.init();     </script> </body> If you are using require.js to structure your project, you can use skrollr as a module as well. require(['skrollr'], function(skrollr){     var s = skrollr.init(); }); If you're familiar with CSS, you already know the style attribute. In order to create an animation you would need several, at least two, of them. That's what skrollr does. You use the HTML5 data- attributes to define multiple sets of styles (we call each of them keyframe) and skrollr interpolates between them. Let's change the background-color of a div starting at #00f when the scrollbar is at the top and ending with #f00 when the user scrolled 500 pixels down <div data-0=""background-color:rgb(0,0,255);"" data-500=""background-color:rgb(255,0,0);"">WOOOT</div> View in browser Lessons learned Skrollr ensures that you can actually scroll down 500 pixels or more, even if there's not enough content. You can suppress this by using the forceHeight option. You can't use #00f or #0000ff. You need to use rgb or hsl and explicitly decide which color space you want because they result in different animations (HSL is much cooler most of the time). Don't worry, the IE plugin teaches IE < 9 to display rgb and hsl correctly. Now let's do a barrel roll at the same time <div data-0=""background-color:rgb(0,0,255);transform:rotate(0deg);"" data-500=""background-color:rgb(255,0,0);transform:rotate(360deg);"">WOOOT</div> View in browser Lessons learned Skrollr handles all these nasty CSS prefixes for you. Just -moz-relax and get yourself a cup of -webkit-coffee. Now let the rotation bounce like it were a hip-hop video <div data-0=""background-color:rgb(0,0,255);transform[bounce]:rotate(0deg);"" data-500=""background-color:rgb(255,0,0);transform[bounce]:rotate(360deg);"">WOOOT</div> View in browser Lessons learned Skrollr allows non-linear animations. The so called easing functions can be used per-property by putting them in square brackets behind the property. There's a built-in list of easing functions (see below in the JavaScript section) and you can use your own functions by using the easings options. Now you may have noticed that using 500 as a keyframe position is kind of random and the look depends on your browser size. Let's have the animation end when the top of the element reaches the top of the viewport (element leaves the viewport) <div data-0=""background-color:rgb(0,0,255);transform[bounce]:rotate(0deg);"" data-top=""background-color:rgb(255,0,0);transform[bounce]:rotate(360deg);"">WOOOT</div> View in browser Lessons learned Skrollr keyframes can either be absolute or relative. That's the end of this short intro. The following sections will explain some more things in detail. If you're not a fan of data-attributes or if you're planning a big website where you want a better and more flexible structure, take a look at skrollr-stylesheets. Mobile support Starting with version 0.5.0 skrollr officially supports mobile browsers including Android and iOS. Furthermore, mobile support has been rewritten from scratch for skrollr 0.6.0. The Problem with mobile and the solution (If you're not interested in the details, just scroll down a bit to see what you need to do for mobile support.) Some words on why this is an important milestone and why others failed: Mobile browsers try to save battery wherever they can. That's why mobile browsers delay the execution of JavaScript while you are scrolling. iOS in particular does this very aggressively and completely stops JavaScript. In short, that's the reason why many scrolling libraries either don't work on mobile devices or they come with their own scrollbar which is a usability nightmare on desktop. It was an important requirement while I developed skrollr that I don't force you to scroll the way I want it. skrollr on desktop uses a native scrollbar and you can scroll the way you want to (keyboard, mouse, etc.). You just told me it doesn't work on mobile, but why does it? The answer is simple. When using skrollr on mobile you don't actually scroll. When detecting a mobile browser, skrollr disables native scrolling and instead listens for touch events and moves the content (more specific the #skrollr-body element) using CSS transforms. What you need in order to support mobile browsers Starting with skrollr 0.6.0 there's just one thing you need to do: Include an element on your page with the id skrollr-body. That's the element we move in order to fake scrolling. The only case where you don't need a #skrollr-body is when using position:fixed exclusively. In fact, the skrollr website doesn't include a #skrollr-body element. If you need both fixed and non-fixed (i.e. static) elements, put the static ones inside the #skrollr-body element. Or to put it differently: On mobile the skrollr-body element is moved using CSS transforms. You can't have position:fixed or background-attachment:fixed inside elements which use CSS transforms as per CSS spec (http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2011/09/12/un-fixing-fixed-elements-with-css-transforms/). That's why those elements need to be outside of the skrollr-body element. The skrollr-body element might be configured within the init-options. AMD Starting with 0.6.22 there's experimental AMD support. Please note that only skrollr core has AMD support so far. We will update the plugins in the future. require(['skrollr'], function(skrollr){     skrollr.init(); }); Absolute vs relative mode Being only able to define key frames in absolute values is simply insufficient for some cases. For example, if you don't know exactly where an element will be in the document. That's why there are two modes for key frames, namely absolute and relative mode. absolute mode (or document mode) The key frames are defined as absolute values describing how much the document has been scrolled down. The syntax is data-[offset]-[anchor], where offset can be any integer (0 is default) and anchor can be either start (default) or end. Either offset or anchor can be omitted in some situations. Here are some examples of key frames and their meaning. data-0 = data-start = data-0-start: When the scroll top is 0. data-100 = data-100-start: When the scroll top is 100. data--100 = data--100-start: When the scroll top is -100 (sounds like nonsense, but keep in mind that interpolation will be relative to this point). data-end = data-0-end: When offset is 0, but counting from the bottom of the document instead of from the top. In short: when you reach the bottom of the page. data-100-end: 100px before we reach the bottom. data--100-end: 100px after we reach the bottom (again, it's up to you whether you need it). relative mode (or viewport mode) Instead of defining key frames relative to the document (i.e. absolute), we are able to define them depending on the position of any element in relation to the viewport. The syntax is data-[offset]-(viewport-anchor)-[element-anchor], where offset can again be any integer and defaults to 0. Both viewport-anchor (mandatory) and element-anchor (optional) can be one of top, center or bottom. If element-anchor is omitted, the value of viewport-anchor will be taken (just like with background-position). Here are some examples of key frames and their meaning. data-top = data-0-top = data-top-top = data-0-top-top: When the element's top is aligned with the top of the viewport. data-100-top = data-100-top-top: When the element's top is 100px above the top of the viewport. data--100-top = data--100-top-top: When the element's top is 100px below the top of the viewport. data-top-bottom= data-0-top-bottom: When the bottom of the element is at the top of the viewport (it's just not visible). data-center-center = data-0-center-center: When the element is at the center of the viewport. data-bottom-center = data-0-bottom-center: When the element's center is at the bottom of the viewport, thus the upper half of the element is visible. By default the keyframes are triggered by the position of the element where the keyframes are described. However there are times when the position of a second element should trigger the first element's keyframes. The data-anchor-target attribute can be used in these cases. The data-anchor-target attribute accepts any CSS selector and the position of the first element on the page matching the selector will be used to trigger keyframes on the element where the attribute is defined. data-anchor-target requires IE 8 or greater. Examples: <divdata-anchor-target=""#foo""> will have it's keyframes tiggered by the position of the #foo element. Any CSS selector can be used, i.e data-anchor-target="".bar:not(.bacon) ~ span > a[href]"" Note: If you need to support IE 7, then you may only use IDs as anchor-targets, i.e. #foo. The IE plugin maps querySelector to getElementById. Here's an infographic for better understanding of anchors (click to open PDF): Important: All those values will be calculated up-front and transformed to absolute mode. So if either the element's box height changes (height, padding, border) or the elements position within the document, you probably need to call refresh() (see documentation in JavaScript section below). Window resizing is handled by skrollr. Percentage offsets All offsets shown above are given in absolute pixel values, e.g. data-300 for 300px from the top or data-13-top-bottom for a 13px offset to the top-bottom anchor. As of skrollr 0.6.13 you can also have offsets as percentages of the viewport by appending a p to the number. For example data-75p for when you scrolled down 75% of the viewport or data-10p-center to have a 10% offset from the center anchor. Hash navigation Check out the skrollr-menu plugin. Working with constants I was lying to you. The syntax for absolute mode is not data-[offset]-[anchor] and for relative mode it's not data-[offset]-(viewport-anchor)-[element-anchor]. In both cases, offset can be preceded by a constant which can be passed to the init method. The name of the constant needs to be preceded with an underscore. Example: skrollr.init({     constants: {         foobar: 1337     } }); <div data-_foobar=""left:0%;"" data-_foobar--100=""left:50%;"" data-_foobar-100=""left:100%;""></div>  <!--Equal to-->  <div data-1337=""left:0%;"" data-1237=""left:50%;"" data-1437=""left:100%;""></div> Valid characters for a constant are [a-z0-9_]. Dynamic constants Starting with skrollr 0.6.19 the word ""constants"" doesn't quite fit anymore, but who cares. You can now use functions and percentages as constants. They are automatically evaluated when the window is resized or if you call refresh. skrollr.init({     constants: {         foo: function() {             //Note: you can access the skrollr instance with `this` for things like `this.relativeToAbsolute`             return Math.random() * 100;//trolololol         },         vh: '100p'     } }); CSS classes skrollr will add a skrollr class to the HTML element when calling init and will remove a no-skrollr class if present. Additionally, it will add a skrollr-desktop or skrollr-mobile class depending on which it detects. This allows fallback CSS rules to create a good user experience on unsupported devices or when JavaScript or skrollr are disabled. All elements under skrollr's control (elements with appropriate data-attributes) will get the skrollable class. In addition, we add either the skrollable-before, skrollable-between or skrollable-after class, depending on whether the current scroll position is before, between or after the first/last (smallest/largest) keyframe of an element. Animating attributes Starting with skrollr 0.6.24 you can also animate attribute and not just style properties. This is especially a big thing because in the SVG world many properties are implemented as attributes and not in CSS. Animating an attribute couldn't be simplier, just prefix the property with an @ symbol! <polygon     points='426,720   -200,720   -200,0   955,0'     data-0=""@points:426,720   -200,720   -200,0   955,0""     data-500=""@points:380,720   -200,720   -200,0   1302,0""> </polygon> Note: as always, skrollr doesn't do any magic. It doesn't understand what a polygon or points are. It's only interpolating numbers, that's it. So make sure you have the same number of numbers in your keyframes (8 in this case). Filling missing values Imagine the following animation <div data-100=""left:0%;"" data-200=""top:0%;"" data-300=""left:50%;"" data-400=""top:50%;""></div> One could expect left to have a value of 25% at keyframe 200. That is not the case. By design, skrollr only interpolates values between key frames which are direct neighbors. What actually happens is that skrollr internally fills out all holes once from left and then from right. So the above is equivalent to <div data-100=""left:0%;top:0%;"" data-200=""left:0%;top:0%;"" data-300=""left:50%;top:0%;"" data-400=""left:50%;top:50%;""></div> Preventing interpolation The reason why skrollr is so lightweight and powerful is because it literally interpolates every number it can find. If you want to prevent some side effect, you can suppress interpolation for a specific value by prepending an exclamation point. Example: <!-- This will get your image url f***** up because there's no ""kitten1.4561799.jpg"" and the like --> <div data-0=""background-image:url(kitten1.jpg);"" data-100=""background-image:url(kitten2.jpg)""></div>  <!-- Better --> <div data-0=""background-image:!url(kitten1.jpg);"" data-100=""background-image:!url(kitten2.jpg)""></div> Note: The values for both keyframes (if they contain a number) need to be prefixed if you want to avoid skrollr throwing an exception at you! Limitations There are some limitations of skrollr you should be aware of. All numeric values have to have the same unit, even 0 needs a unit. It's not possible to animate from 5% to 100px. skrollr won't complain, but results are undefined. Animations between values which are composed of multiple numeric values like margin:0 0 0 0; are only possible for the same number of values. margin:0px 0px 0px 0px; to margin:0px 100px 50px 3px; is fine, but not margin:10px; to margin:5px 10px;. Animations between CSS transforms only work when they use the same functions in same order. From rotate(0deg) scale(1) to rotate(1000deg) scale(5) is fine. Color animations don't support named values like ""red"" or hex values like ""#ff0000"". Instead, you have to use rgb(), rgba(), hsl() and hsla(). Don't worry, there's a skrollr plugin for IE < 9 to support hsl() (without ""a""!) and to fall rgba back to rgb. Color animations only work for same color functions. hsl() to hsl() or hsla() is fine, but not rgb() to hsl(). Which makes sense, because animating from the same colors in rgb space and in hsl space results in different animations (hsl gives you the nice rainbow stuff). But feel free to send in a pull request to fix any of them. Just keep in mind that keeping skrollr as lightweight as possible has high priority. JavaScript On the JavaScript part there's not much to do (you can, if you want to!). So if you only know CSS and HTML, perfect. skrollr.init([options]) All there is to do is to call skrollr.init([options]); which returns an instance of the singleton skrollr class. Subsequent calls to init() will just return the same skrollr instance again. Possible options for init() are smoothScrolling=true Smooth scrolling smoothens your animations. When you scroll down 50 pixels, the animations will transition instead of jumping to the new position. The global setting can be overridden per element by setting data-smooth-scrolling to on or off. smoothScrollingDuration=200 The number of milliseconds the animations run after the scroll position changed the last time. constants={} An object containing integers as values. The keys can contain [a-z0-9_]. They do not need a leading underscore. Example: data-_myconst-200 and skrollr.init({constants: {myconst: 300}}) result in data-500. scale=1 By default, skrollr uses the largest key frame and makes document height + viewport height this high, thus the max possible scroll top offset. If your animation runs too fast or too slow, just adjust the scale value. scale only affects keyframes in absolute mode. When forceHeight is set to false, scale is ignored. scale affects constants as well. scale does only affect key frames in absolute mode, e.g. data-500 but not data-top. forceHeight=true true: Make sure the document is high enough that all key frames fit inside. Example: You use data-1000, but the content only makes the document 500px high. skrollr will ensure that you can scroll down the whole 1000px. Or if you use relative mode, e.g. data-top-bottom, skrollr will make sure the bottom of the element can actually reach the top of the viewport. false: Don't manipulate the document and just keep the natural scrollbar. mobileCheck=function() {...} This option allows you to pass a function to skrollr overwriting the check for mobile devices. The function should return true when mobile scrolling should be used and false if not. The default looks like this function() {     return (/Android|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry/i).test(navigator.userAgent || navigator.vendor || window.opera); } mobileDeceleration=0.004 The amount of deceleration for momentum scrolling on mobile devices. This options tells skrollr how fast or slow you want the scrolling to stop after the user lifted his finger. Set it to 1 to disable momentum scrolling. skrollrBody='skrollr-body' This option allows you to override the default id-selector used for supporting mobile browsers. It might come in handy when the element in question already has a assigned id or if you would like to define more then one skrollrBody depending on preceding JavaScript-logic. edgeStrategy='set' This option specifies how to handle animations when the scroll position is outside the range on the keyframes (i.e. before the first or after the last keyframe). One of three options are possible set (default): When before/after the first/last keyframe, apply the styles of the first/last keyframe to the element. ease: Same as set, but the values will be transformed using the given easing function. reset: When before/after the first/last keyframe, apply the styles which the element had before skrollr did anything. This means resetting the class attribute as well as removing all styles which have been applied to the style property. This means the element won't have any skrollable-* CSS classes. Example: Given the following element with two keyframes <div data-1000=""left:0%;top:0%;"" data-2000=""left:50%;top:100%;"" style=""left:-100%;"" class=""section""></div> and the following easing function which always returns 0.5 (I know it's pointless, but it's just an example. A real world example would be an easing function that represents a curve and starts somewhere between 0 and 1, but not at 1) function(p) {     return 0.5; } and imagine the scrollbar is at 237, which is below the first keyframe which is at 1000. set will result in <div style=""left:0%;top:0%;"" class=""section skrollable skrollable-before""></div> which is plain data-1000. ease will result in <div style=""left:25%;top:50%;"" class=""section skrollable skrollable-before""></div> which is 0.5 * data-1000. reset will result in <div style=""left:-100%;"" class=""section""></div> which is what the element originally had. Note how top is missing. beforerender A listener function that gets called each time right before we render everything. The function will be passed an object with the following properties: {     curTop: 10, //the current scroll top offset     lastTop: 0, //the top value of last time     maxTop: 100, //the max value you can scroll to. curTop/maxTop will give you the current progress.     direction: 'down' //either up or down } Returning false will prevent rendering. render A listener function that gets called right after we finished rendering everything. The function will be passed with the same parameters as beforerender. Example skrollr.init({     render: function(data) {         //Log the current scroll position.         console.log(data.curTop);     } }); keyframe Experimental In order to receive keyframe events from an element, add the data-emit-events attribute to the element. The keyframe function will be called with three arguments The element that passed the keyframe. The name of the keyframe, camel-cased (see example). The direction the user is scrolling. Example: <div     data-500=""...""     data-top-bottom=""...""     data-_offset-center=""...""     data-emit-events >     Some content </div> skrollr.init({     keyframe: function(element, name, direction) {         //name will be one of data500, dataTopBottom, data_offsetCenter     } }); Note: this is experimental, expect the API to change! Originally I wanted to emit the events right on the element, so you could do this //Wouldn't this be nice? document.querySelector('#foo').addEventListener('skrollr.dataTopBottom.up', function() {     //#foo just passed the data-top-bottom keyframe while scrolling up }, false) but IE. easing An object defining new easing functions or overwriting existing ones. Easing functions get just one argument, which is a value between 0 and 1 (the percentage of how much of the animation is done). The function should return a value between 0 and 1 as well, but for some easings a value less than 0 or greater than 1 is just fine. An easing function basically transforms the timeline for an animation. When the animation should be 50% done, you can transform it to be 90% done or whatever your function does. Example: skrollr.init({     easing: {         //This easing will sure drive you crazy         wtf: Math.random,         inverted: function(p) {             return 1 - p;         }     } }); You can now use the easing functions like any other. skrollr ships with some built in functions: linear: The default. Doesn't need to be specified. quadratic: To the power of two. So 50% looks like 25%. cubic: To the power of three. So 50% looks like 12.5% begin/end: They always return 0 or 1 respectively. No animation. swing: Slow at the beginning and accelerates at the end. So 25% -> 14.6%, 50% -> 50%, 75% -> 85.3% sqrt: Square root. Starts fast, slows down at the end. outCubic bounce: Bounces like a ball. See https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tbr20s8vd2 for a graphical representation. Custom easing Use this generator Insert the given polynomial coeficients instead of t, t2, t3, t4 and t5 t5*(p*p*p*p*p) + t4*(p*p*p*p) + t3*(p*p*p) + t2*(p*p) + t*p  Example shown with the values for easeOutElasticBig easeOutElasticBig: function(p) {   return 56*(p*p*p*p*p) - 175*(p*p*p*p) + 200*(p*p*p) - 100*(p*p) + 20*p; }  skrollr.get() Returns the skrollr instance if init() has been called before or undefined. Public API Calling init() returns an instance of skrollr which exposes a public api. refresh([elements]) Reparses all given elements. You can pass a single element or an array-like element (Array, NodeList or jQuery object) Useful when Elements in relative mode change and need to be updated. Data-attributes are manipulated dynamically. New elements are added to the DOM and should be controlled by skrollr. When no elements are given, all elements in the document will be parsed again. In fact, when calling skrollr.init() skrollr uses refresh() without parameters internally. Time consuming operations, should not be called on every rendering. relativeToAbsolute(element, viewportAnchor, elementAnchor) Returns an integer which represents the absolute scroll position which correlates to the relative anchor. element must be a DOM element. viewportAnchor and elementAnchor must be one of top, center or bottom Example: var offset = s.relativeToAbsolute(document.getElementById('foo'), 'top', 'bottom');  //offset contains the scroll position at which #foo's bottom is at the top of the viewport. //If you now use setScrollTop(offset) or animateTo(offset) #foo's bottom will be perfectly aligned with the top of the viewport. Yay. getScrollTop() Returns the current scroll offset in pixels. Normalizes different browser quirks and handles mobile scrolling. getMaxScrollTop() Returns the number of pixels that can be scrolled down in total. If forceHeight is true, that's usually the largest keyframe. Otherwise it's the height of the document minus the viewport height. setScrollTop(top[, force = false]) Sets the top offset using window.scrollTo(0, top) on desktop or updating the internal state in case of mobile scrolling. When force is set to true, skrollr will jump to the new position without any kind of transition. By default, the global smoothScrolling setting applies. isMobile() Returns if skrollr runs in mobile mode (see also mobileCheck option). animateTo(top[, options]) Animates the scroll position from current position to top. Possible options are duration How long the animation should run in milliseconds. The default is 1000 or one second. easing The name of an easing function. The same functions can be used as for property animations. Default is linear . done A function to be called after the animation finished. When you pass a top value, which is the same as the current, then the function will be called immediately. The function gets a boolean argument interrupted which indicates if the animation was interrupted by stopAnimateTo or finished to the end. stopAnimateTo() Stops the animation and calls the done callback passing true as interrupted arguments. isAnimatingTo() Returns if an animation caused by animateTo is running. on(name, fn) Set a listener function for one of the events described in the options section (beforerender, render, keyframe). Only one listener can be attached at a given time. This method overwrites the current listener, if any. off(name) Removes the listener for the given event. destroy() Destroys skrollr. All class and style attributes will be set to the values they had before. Changelog See HISTORY.md. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Where no gyroscope or motion detection hardware is available, the position of the cursor is used instead. Check out this demo to see it in action! Setup Create a list of elements giving each item that you want to move within your parallax scene a class of layer and a data-depth attribute specifying its depth within the scene. A depth of 0 will cause the layer to remain stationary, and a depth of 1 will cause the layer to move by the total effect of the calculated motion. Values inbetween 0 and 1 will cause the layer to move by an amount relative to the supplied ratio. <ul id=""scene"">   <li class=""layer"" data-depth=""0.00""><img src=""layer1.png""></li>   <li class=""layer"" data-depth=""0.20""><img src=""layer2.png""></li>   <li class=""layer"" data-depth=""0.40""><img src=""layer3.png""></li>   <li class=""layer"" data-depth=""0.60""><img src=""layer4.png""></li>   <li class=""layer"" data-depth=""0.80""><img src=""layer5.png""></li>   <li class=""layer"" data-depth=""1.00""><img src=""layer6.png""></li> </ul> To kickoff a Parallax scene, select your parent DOM Element and pass it to the Parallax constructor. var scene = document.getElementById('scene'); var parallax = new Parallax(scene); Understanding Layer Motion Calculations The amount of motion that each layer moves by depends on 3 contributing factors: The scalarX and scalarY values (see Behaviours below for configuration) The dimensions of the parent DOM element The depth of a layer within a parallax scene (specified by it's data-depth attribute) The calculation for this motion is as follows: xMotion = parentElement.width  * (scalarX / 100) * layerDepth yMotion = parentElement.height * (scalarY / 100) * layerDepth So for a layer with a data-depth value of 0.5 within a scene that has both the scalarX and scalarY values set to 10 ( the default ) where the containing scene element is 1000px x 1000px, the total motion of the layer in both x and y would be: xMotion = 1000 * (10 / 100) * 0.5 = 50 # 50px of positive and negative motion in x yMotion = 1000 * (10 / 100) * 0.5 = 50 # 50px of positive and negative motion in y Behaviours There are a number of behaviours that you can setup for any given Parallax instance. These behaviours can either be specified in the markup via data attributes or in JavaScript via the constructor and API. Behaviour Values Description relativeInput true or false Specifies whether or not to use the coordinate system of the element passed to the parallax constructor. Mouse input only. clipRelativeInput true or false Specifies whether or not to clip the mouse input to the bounds of the element passed to the parallax constructor. Mouse input only. calibrate-x true or false Specifies whether or not to cache & calculate the motion relative to the initial x axis value on initialisation. calibrate-y true or false Specifies whether or not to cache & calculate the motion relative to the initial y axis value on initialisation. invert-x true or false true moves layers in opposition to the device motion, false slides them away. invert-y true or false true moves layers in opposition to the device motion, false slides them away. limit-x number or false A numeric value limits the total range of motion in x, false allows layers to move with complete freedom. limit-y number or false A numeric value limits the total range of motion in y, false allows layers to move with complete freedom. scalar-x number Multiplies the input motion by this value, increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of the layer motion. scalar-y number Multiplies the input motion by this value, increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of the layer motion. friction-x number 0 - 1 The amount of friction the layers experience.

UIWebView no longer automatically receives the deviceorientation event, so your native application must intercept the events from the gyroscope and reroute them to the UIWebView: Include the CoreMotion framework #import <CoreMotion/CoreMotion.h> and create a reference to the UIWebView @property(nonatomic, strong) IBOutlet UIWebView *parallaxWebView; Add a property to the app delegate (or controller that will own the UIWebView) @property(nonatomic, strong) CMMotionManager *motionManager; Finally, make the following calls: self.motionManager = [[CMMotionManager alloc] init]; if (self.motionManager.isGyroAvailable && !self.motionManager.isGyroActive) {   [self.motionManager setGyroUpdateInterval:0.5f]; // Set the event update frequency (in seconds)   [self.motionManager startGyroUpdatesToQueue:NSOperationQueue.mainQueue                                   withHandler:^(CMGyroData *gyroData, NSError *error) {     NSString *js = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""parallax.onDeviceOrientation({beta:%f, gamma:%f})"", gyroData.rotationRate.x, gyroData.rotationRate.y];     [self.parallaxWebView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:js];   }]; } Build As a prerequisite, you will need gulp installed: npm install -g gulp npm install gulp  During development you can have gulp watch the source directory for changes and automatically build the deploy files by running: gulp watch  Author Matthew Wagerfield: @wagerfield License Licensed under MIT.

If parallax scrolling is something you care about, please apply to become a contributor to this project. Parallax scrolling made easy Full guide and demonstrations available at the official Stellar.js project page. Download Get the development or production version, or use a package manager. Getting Started Stellar.js is a jQuery plugin that provides parallax scrolling effects to any scrolling element. The first step is to run .stellar() against the element: // For example: $(window).stellar(); // or: $('#main').stellar(); If you're running Stellar.js on 'window', you can use the shorthand: $.stellar(); This will look for any parallax backgrounds or elements within the specified element and reposition them when the element scrolls. Mobile Support Support in Mobile WebKit browsers requires a touch scrolling library, and a slightly tweaked configuration. For a full walkthrough on how to implement this correctly, read my blog post ""Mobile Parallax with Stellar.js"". Please note that parallax backgrounds are not recommended in Mobile WebKit due to performance constraints. Instead, use parallax elements with static backgrounds. Parallax Elements If you want elements to scroll at a different speed, add the following attribute to any element with a CSS position of absolute, relative or fixed: <div data-stellar-ratio=""2""> The ratio is relative to the natural scroll speed, so a ratio of 0.5 would cause the element to scroll at half-speed, a ratio of 1 would have no effect, and a ratio of 2 would cause the element to scroll at twice the speed. If a ratio lower than 1 is causing the element to appear jittery, try setting its CSS position to fixed. In order for Stellar.js to perform its calculations correctly, all parallax elements must have their dimensions specified in pixels for the axis/axes being used for parallax effects. For example, all parallax elements for a vertical site must have a pixel height specified. If your design prohibits the use of pixels, try using the 'responsive' option. Parallax Backgrounds If you want an element's background image to reposition on scroll, simply add the following attribute: <div data-stellar-background-ratio=""0.5""> As with parallax elements, the ratio is relative to the natural scroll speed. For ratios lower than 1, to avoid jittery scroll performance, set the element's CSS 'background-attachment' to fixed. Configuring Offsets Stellar.js' most powerful feature is the way it aligns elements. All elements will return to their original positioning when their offset parent meets the edge of the screen—plus or minus your own optional offset. This allows you to create intricate parallax patterns very easily. Confused? See how offsets are used on the Stellar.js home page. To modify the offsets for all elements at once, pass in the options: $.stellar({   horizontalOffset: 40,   verticalOffset: 150 }); You can also modify the offsets on a per-element basis using the following data attributes: <div data-stellar-ratio=""2""      data-stellar-horizontal-offset=""40""      data-stellar-vertical-offset=""150""> Configuring Offset Parents By default, offsets are relative to the element's offset parent. This mirrors the way an absolutely positioned element behaves when nested inside an element with a relative position. As with regular CSS, the closest parent element with a position of relative or absolute is the offset parent. To override this and force the offset parent to be another element higher up the DOM, use the following data attribute: <div data-stellar-offset-parent=""true""> The offset parent can also have its own offsets: <div data-stellar-offset-parent=""true""      data-stellar-horizontal-offset=""40""      data-stellar-vertical-offset=""150""> Similar to CSS, the rules take precedence from element, to offset parent, to JavaScript options. Confused? See how offset parents are used on the Stellar.js home page. Still confused? See what it looks like with its default offset parents. Notice how the alignment happens on a per-letter basis? That's because each letter's containing div is its default offset parent. By specifying the h2 element as the offset parent, we can ensure that the alignment of all the stars in a heading is based on the h2 and not the div further down the DOM tree. Configuring Scroll Positioning You can define what it means for an element to 'scroll'. Whether it's the element's scroll position that's changing, its margins or its CSS3 'transform' position, you can define it using the 'scrollProperty' option: $('#gallery').stellar({   scrollProperty: 'transform' }); This option is what allows you to run Stellar.js on iOS. You can even define how the elements are repositioned, whether it's through standard top and left properties or using CSS3 transforms: $('#gallery').stellar({   positionProperty: 'transform' }); Don't have the level of control you need? Write a plugin! Otherwise, you're ready to get started! Configuring Everything Below you will find a complete list of options and matching default values: $.stellar({   // Set scrolling to be in either one or both directions   horizontalScrolling: true,   verticalScrolling: true,    // Set the global alignment offsets   horizontalOffset: 0,   verticalOffset: 0,    // Refreshes parallax content on window load and resize   responsive: false,    // Select which property is used to calculate scroll.   // Choose 'scroll', 'position', 'margin' or 'transform',   // or write your own 'scrollProperty' plugin.   scrollProperty: 'scroll',    // Select which property is used to position elements.   // Choose between 'position' or 'transform',   // or write your own 'positionProperty' plugin.   positionProperty: 'position',    // Enable or disable the two types of parallax   parallaxBackgrounds: true,   parallaxElements: true,    // Hide parallax elements that move outside the viewport   hideDistantElements: true,    // Customise how elements are shown and hidden   hideElement: function($elem) { $elem.hide(); },   showElement: function($elem) { $elem.show(); } }); Writing a Scroll Property Plugin Out of the box, Stellar.js supports the following scroll properties: 'scroll', 'position', 'margin' and 'transform'. If your method for creating a scrolling interface isn't covered by one of these, you can write your own. For example, if 'margin' didn't exist yet you could write it like so: $.stellar.scrollProperty.margin = {   getLeft: function($element) {     return parseInt($element.css('margin-left'), 10) * -1;   },   getTop: function($element) {     return parseInt($element.css('margin-top'), 10) * -1;   } } Now, you can specify this scroll property in Stellar.js' configuration. $.stellar({   scrollProperty: 'margin' }); Writing a Position Property Plugin Stellar.js has two methods for positioning elements built in: 'position' for modifying its top and left properties, and 'transform' for using CSS3 transforms. If you need more control over how elements are positioned, you can write your own setter functions. For example, if 'position' didn't exist yet, it could be written as a plugin like this: $.stellar.positionProperty.position = {   setTop: function($element, newTop, originalTop) {     $element.css('top', newTop);   },   setLeft: function($element, newLeft, originalLeft) {     $element.css('left', newLeft);   } } Now, you can specify this position property in Stellar.js' configuration. $.stellar({   positionProperty: 'position' }); If, for technical reasons, you need to set both properties at once, you can define a single 'setPosition' function: $.stellar.positionProperty.foobar = {   setPosition: function($element, newLeft, originalLeft, newTop, originalTop) {     $element.css('transform', 'translate3d(' +       (newLeft - originalLeft) + 'px, ' +       (newTop - originalTop) + 'px, ' +       '0)');   } }  $.stellar({   positionProperty: 'foobar' }); Package Managers Stellar.js can be installed with Bower: $ bower install jquery.stellar Sites Using Stellar.js National Geographic - Alien Deep Interactive François Hollande Brabus Private Aviation Mary and Frankie's Wedding IT Support London Ashford University Clif Adventures Mindster WS Interactive Moire Mag - Untitled Carnival of Courage Ian Poulter 360 Strategy Group Code, Love and Boards I'm sure there are heaps more.

I won't be adding bug fixes or future improvements at this time. Plax is old enough that there are better options available so go forth an parallax! Plax Plax is a jQuery plugin that makes it suuuuuper easy to parallax elements in your site based on mouse position. You can see it implemented in many places throughout GitHub, including the 404 page, the 500 page, and the about page. I've also used a modified version to parallax a URL. Dependencies jQuery Usage Plax Demo In the <head> of your document, link both jQuery and plax. <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/js/jquery.min.js""></script> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/js/plax.js""></script> Then in your javascript, add each ""layer"" to the list of layers to be parallaxed. Once that's done, enable Plax and you're good to go. $('#plax-octocat').plaxify({""xRange"":40,""yRange"":40}) $('#plax-earth').plaxify({""xRange"":20,""yRange"":20,""invert"":true}) $('#plax-bg').plaxify({""xRange"":10,""yRange"":10,""invert"":true}) $.plax.enable() Another way is to specify the arguments as data attributes on the layer elements. <img src=""octocat.png"" data-xrange=""40"" data-yrange=""40""> <img src=""earth.png"" data-xrange=""20"" data-yrange=""20""> <img src=""bg.png"" data-xrange=""10"" data-yrange=""10"" data-invert=""true""> Then plaxify them in bulk. $('img').plaxify() $.plax.enable() If you would like your elements to parallax only when a certain element is moused over, you need to supply an argument to enable() $.plax.enable({ ""activityTarget"": $('#myPlaxDiv')}) You can dynamically redefine the range of a layer by running plaxify() on it again. If the id matches another id in the layer array, it will replace it with the new range. $('#plax-octocat').plaxify({""xRange"":40,""yRange"":40}) $('#plax-earth').plaxify({""xRange"":20,""yRange"":20,""invert"":true}) $('#plax-bg').plaxify({""xRange"":10,""yRange"":10,""invert"":true}) $.plax.enable()  $('#my-btn').click(function(){   // bigger range   $('#plax-octocat').plaxify({""xRange"":200,""yRange"":200}) }) Documentation plaxify() Add an item to the list of parallaxing layers. Ranges are centered at the items start location. For example, an item with a 20px range will be able to move 10px forward and 10px backward from its start location. Parameters xRange — integer: is the distance across the x-axis the object will travel. yRange — integer: is the distance across the y-axis the object will travel. invert — boolean: (optional) inverting will invert the direction the object will travel across each axis.* * The same effect can be achieved by providing xRange and yRange with negative numbers, making it possible to invert only a single axis. useTransform — boolean: (optional) defaults - true. When supported translate3d will be used rather than top and left* enable() Enable parallaxing. Parameters activityTarget — Object: (optional) sets a specific DOM element over which Plax will track the mouse. gyroRange — Integer / Float: (optional) sets the degrees of tilt needed to reach full movement in one direction, from the center position. For the full range, two times the degrees tilt is needed. Default value: 30. disable() Disable parallaxing. Parameters restorePositions — Boolean: (optional) resets all previously defined layers to their original positions when plax is deactivated. clearLayers — Boolean: (optional) clears all previously defined layers when disabling. Best Practices Items should be absolutely positioned, with top: and left: values specified. If you plan to parallax a background plane, be sure to give it enough extra ""bleed"" room so the image stays behind it's frame at all times. Usually your bleed on one side should be equal to half the range you give it, though you can give it more if you are paranoid. For more realistic parallaxing (see ""how to do the math"" below), pick an ""anchor object"". Base your ranges for each object on the anchor object's range, getting exponentially larger the farther it is supposed to be from the anchor object. For example, an object close to your anchor object might have 2x its range, while an object really far away may have 5x as big a range. Objects that appear behind the anchor object should have invert set to true. How To Fake It Here are a couple real-life examples of parallaxing and a quick description of how you might emulate it with Plax. Example #1 Picture driving down the highway. There are three objects: You, in the inside lane, a truck in the outside lane, and a sign on the side of the road. As you drive past the truck, the sign always manages to stay just out of view behind the truck. The lesson In this case, the truck becomes the ""anchor"", as it stays relatively still. It is the item upon which all the movement is based. If you were to recreate this scenario in your javascript, the truck would have a small range, say 10–20 pixels. That way, it would move a little, but not too much. Since the car you are in is moving faster relative to the truck it would need a larger range like 50–100 pixels. Finally, the sign, since it is ""behind"" the truck, will need to have invert set to true. Any object behind the ""anchor"" object should be inverted. Assuming the sign is always about the same distance from the truck as you are (the scenario where you never actually see the sign) then its range should also be around 50–100 pixels. Example #2 Picture another driving scenario. You're the passenger in a car driving past a barn. In the distance you can see mountains. If you look at the grass on the side of the road, it seems to be flying by at blazing speed. If you look at the barn, it still appears to be passing by, but much more slowly than the grass. If you look to the mountains in the distance, they pretty much seem to be staying where they are at. The lesson The principals from the previous scenario are still present in this situation, only the anchor has moved to the back layer (the mountains). Since the mountains are far off in the distance and barely moving, they get a range of 5–10 pixels. Each layer as it comes forward should have a greater range than the layer before it. The barn would probably have 20–30 pixels of range and the grass near the road would probably have 100 pixels of range. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Introduction Compatibility Usage Creating links to sections or slides Creating smaller or bigger sections State classes added by fullpage.js Lazy loading Autoplay embedded media Options Methods Callbacks Reporting issues Contributing to fullpage.js Changelog Build tasks Resources Who is using fullpage.js Donations License Introduction Suggestion are more than welcome, not only for feature requests but also for coding style improvements. Let's make this a great plugin to make people's lives easier! Compatibility fullPage.js is fully functional on all modern browsers, as well as some old ones such as Internet Explorer 8, 9, Opera 12, etc. It works with browsers with CSS3 support and with the ones which don't have it, making it ideal for old browsers compatibility. It also provides touch support for mobile phones, tablets and touch screen computers. Special thanks to Browserstack for supporting fullpage.js. Usage As you can see in the example files, you will need to include: jQuery library. (1.6.0 minimum) The JavaScript file jquery.fullPage.js (or its minified version jquery.fullPage.min.js) The css file jquery.fullPage.css Optionally, when using css3:false, you can add the jQuery UI library in case you want to use other easing effects apart from the ones included in the jQuery library (linear and swing ) or the one included by default in fullPage.js (easeInOutCubic). Install using bower or npm Optionally, you can install fullPage.js with bower or npm if you prefer: Terminal: // With bower bower install fullpage.js  // With npm npm install fullpage.js Including files: <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""jquery.fullPage.css"" />  <script src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js""></script>  <!-- This following line is optional. Only necessary if you use the option css3:false and you want to use other easing effects rather than ""linear"", ""swing"" or ""easeInOutCubic"". --> <script src=""vendors/jquery.easings.min.js""></script>   <!-- This following line is only necessary in the case of using the plugin option `scrollOverflow:true` --> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""vendors/scrolloverflow.min.js""></script>  <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""jquery.fullPage.js""></script> Optional use of CDN If you prefer to use a CDN to load the needed files, fullPage.js is in CDNJS: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/fullPage.js Required HTML structure Start your HTML document with the compulsory HTML DOCTYPE declaration on the 1st line of your HTML code. You might have troubles with sections heights otherwise. The examples provided use HTML 5 doctype <!DOCTYPE html>. Each section will be defined with an element containing the section class. The active section by default will be the first section, which is taken as the home page. Sections should be placed inside a wrapper (<div id=""fullpage""> in this case). The wrapper can not be the body element. <div id=""fullpage"">     <div class=""section"">Some section</div>     <div class=""section"">Some section</div>     <div class=""section"">Some section</div>     <div class=""section"">Some section</div> </div> If you want to define a different starting point rather than the first section or the first slide of a section, just add the class active to the section and slide you want to load first. <div class=""section active"">Some section</div> In order to create a landscape slider within a section, each slide will be defined by default with an element containing the slide class: <div class=""section"">     <div class=""slide""> Slide 1 </div>     <div class=""slide""> Slide 2 </div>     <div class=""slide""> Slide 3 </div>     <div class=""slide""> Slide 4 </div> </div> You can see a fully working example of the HTML structure in the demoPage.html file. Initialization All you need to do is call the plugin inside a $(document).ready function: $(document).ready(function() {     $('#fullpage').fullpage(); }); A more complex initialization with all options set could look like this: $(document).ready(function() {     $('#fullpage').fullpage({         //Navigation         menu: '#menu',         lockAnchors: false,         anchors:['firstPage', 'secondPage'],         navigation: false,         navigationPosition: 'right',         navigationTooltips: ['firstSlide', 'secondSlide'],         showActiveTooltip: false,         slidesNavigation: true,         slidesNavPosition: 'bottom',          //Scrolling         css3: true,         scrollingSpeed: 700,         autoScrolling: true,         fitToSection: true,         fitToSectionDelay: 1000,         scrollBar: false,         easing: 'easeInOutCubic',         easingcss3: 'ease',         loopBottom: false,         loopTop: false,         loopHorizontal: true,         continuousVertical: false,         normalScrollElements: '#element1, .element2',         scrollOverflow: false,         scrollOverflowOptions: null,         touchSensitivity: 15,         normalScrollElementTouchThreshold: 5,         bigSectionsDestination: null,          //Accessibility         keyboardScrolling: true,         animateAnchor: true,         recordHistory: true,          //Design         controlArrows: true,         verticalCentered: true,         sectionsColor : ['#ccc', '#fff'],         paddingTop: '3em',         paddingBottom: '10px',         fixedElements: '#header, .footer',         responsiveWidth: 0,         responsiveHeight: 0,          //Custom selectors         sectionSelector: '.section',         slideSelector: '.slide',          //events         onLeave: function(index, nextIndex, direction){},         afterLoad: function(anchorLink, index){},         afterRender: function(){},         afterResize: function(){},         afterSlideLoad: function(anchorLink, index, slideAnchor, slideIndex){},         onSlideLeave: function(anchorLink, index, slideIndex, direction, nextSlideIndex){}     }); }); Creating links to sections or slides If you are using fullPage.js with anchor links for the sections (using the anchors option or the attribute data-anchor in each section), then you will be able to use anchor links also to navigate directly to a certain slide inside a section. This would be an example of a link with an anchor: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#secondPage/2 (which is the URL you will see once you access to that section/slide manually) Notice the last part of the URL ends in #secondPage/2. Having the following initialization: $(document).ready(function() {     $('#fullpage').fullpage({         anchors:['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage']     }); }); The anchor at the end of the URL #secondPage/2 defines the section and slide of destination respectively. In the previous URL, the section of destination will be the one defined with the anchor secondPage and the slide will be the 2nd slide, as we are using the index 2 for it. (the fist slide of a section has index 0, as technically it is a section). We could have used a custom anchor for the slide instead of its index if we would have used the attribute data-anchor on the HTML markup like so: <div class=""section"">     <div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide1""> Slide 1 </div>     <div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide2""> Slide 2 </div>     <div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide3""> Slide 3 </div>     <div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide4""> Slide 4 </div> </div> In this last case, the URL we would use would be #secondPage/slide3, which is the equivalent to our previous #secondPage/2. Note that section anchors can also be defined in the same way, by using the data-anchor attribute, if no anchors array is provided. Be careful! data-anchor tags can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE). Creating smaller or bigger sections Demo fullPage.js provides a way to remove the full height restriction from its sections and slides. It is possible to create sections which height is smaller or bigger thant the viewport. This is ideal for footers. It is important to realise that it doesn't make sense to have all of your sections using this feature. If there is more than one section in the initial load of the site, the plugin won't scroll at all to see the next one as it will be already in the viewport. To create smaller sections just use the class fp-auto-height in the section you want to apply it. It will then take the height defined by your section/slide content. <div class=""section"">Whole viewport</div> <div class=""section fp-auto-height"">Auto height</div> Responsive auto height sections A responsive auto height can be applied by using the class fp-auto-height-responsive. This way sections will be full height until the responsive mode gets fired. State classes added by fullpage.js Fullpage.js adds multiple classes in different elements to keep a record of the status of the site: active is added the current visible section and slide. active is added to the current menu element (if using the menu option). A class of the form fp-viewing-SECTION-SLIDE is added to the body element of the site. (eg: fp-viewing-secondPage-0) The SECTION and SLIDE parts will be the anchors (or indexes if no anchor is provided) of the current section and slide. fp-responsive is added to the body element when the entering in the responsive mode fp-enabled is added to the html element when fullpage.js is enabled. (and removed when destroyed). fp-destroyed is added to the fullpage.js container when the plugin is destroyed. fp-enabled is added to the html element once the libary is initalized. Lazy Loading Demo fullPage.js provides a way to lazy load images, videos and audio elements so they won't slow down the loading of your site or unnecessarily waste data transfer. When using lazy loading, all these elements will only get loaded when entering in the viewport. To enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your src attribute to data-src as shown below: <img data-src=""image.png""> <video>     <source data-src=""video.webm"" type=""video/webm"" />     <source data-src=""video.mp4"" type=""video/mp4"" /> </video>  Auto play/pause embedded media Play on section/slide load: Using the attribute autoplay for videos or audio, or the param autoplay=1 for youtube iframes will result in the media element playing on page load. In order to play it on section/slide load use instead the attribute data-autoplay. For example: <audio data-autoplay>     <source src=""http://metakoncept.hr/horse.ogg"" type=""audio/ogg""> </audio> Pause on leave Embedded HTML5 <video> / <audio> and Youtube iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a section or slide. This can be disabled by using the attribute data-keepplaying. For example: <audio data-keepplaying>     <source src=""http://metakoncept.hr/horse.ogg"" type=""audio/ogg""> </audio> Options controlArrows: (default true) Determines whether to use control arrows for the slides to move right or left. verticalCentered: (default true) Vertically centering of the content within sections. When set to true, your content will be wrapped by the plugin. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the afterRender callback. scrollingSpeed: (default 700) Speed in milliseconds for the scrolling transitions. sectionsColor:(default none) Define the CSS background-color property for each section: Example: $('#fullpage').fullpage({     sectionsColor: ['#f2f2f2', '#4BBFC3', '#7BAABE', 'whitesmoke', '#000'], }); anchors: (default []) Defines the anchor links (#example) to be shown on the URL for each section. Anchors value should be unique. The position of the anchors in the array will define to which sections the anchor is applied. (second position for second section and so on). Using anchors forward and backward navigation will also be possible through the browser. This option also allows users to bookmark a specific section or slide. Be careful! anchors can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE). Now anchors can be defined directly in the HTML structure by using the attribute data-anchor as explained here. lockAnchors: (default false). Determines whether anchors in the URL will have any effect at all in the plugin. You can still using anchors internally for your own functions and callbacks, but they won't have any effect in the scrolling of the site. Useful if you want to combine fullPage.js with other plugins using anchor in the URL. Important It is helpful to understand that the values in the anchors option array correlate directly to the element with the class of .section by it's position in the markup. easing: (default easeInOutCubic) Defines the transition effect to use for the vertical and horizontal scrolling. It requires the file vendors/jquery.easings.min.js or jQuery UI for using some of its transitions. Other libraries could be used instead. easingcss3: (default ease) Defines the transition effect to use in case of using css3:true. You can use the pre-defined ones (such as linear, ease-out...) or create your own ones using the cubic-bezier function. You might want to use Matthew Lein CSS Easing Animation Tool for it. loopTop: (default false) Defines whether scrolling up in the first section should scroll to the last one or not. loopBottom: (default false) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section should scroll to the first one or not. loopHorizontal: (default true) Defines whether horizontal sliders will loop after reaching the last or previous slide or not. css3: (default true). Defines whether to use JavaScript or CSS3 transforms to scroll within sections and slides. Useful to speed up the movement in tablet and mobile devices with browsers supporting CSS3. If this option is set to true and the browser doesn't support CSS3, a jQuery fallback will be used instead. autoScrolling: (default true) Defines whether to use the ""automatic"" scrolling or the ""normal"" one. It also has affects the way the sections fit in the browser/device window in tablets and mobile phones. fitToSection: (default true). Determines whether or not to fit sections to the viewport or not. When set to true the current active section will always fill the whole viewport. Otherwise the user will be free to stop in the middle of a section (when ) fitToSectionDelay: (default 1000). If fitToSection is set to true, this delays the fitting by the configured milliseconds. scrollBar: (default false). Determines whether to use scrollbar for the site or not. In case of using scroll bar, the autoScrolling functionality will still working as expected. The user will also be free to scroll the site with the scroll bar and fullPage.js will fit the section in the screen when scrolling finishes. paddingTop: (default 0) Defines the top padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingTop: '10px', paddingTop: '10em'...) Useful in case of using a fixed header. paddingBottom: (default 0) Defines the bottom padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingBottom: '10px', paddingBottom: '10em'...). Useful in case of using a fixed footer. fixedElements: (default null) Defines which elements will be taken off the scrolling structure of the plugin which is necessary when using the css3 option to keep them fixed. It requires a string with the jQuery selectors for those elements. (For example: fixedElements: '#element1, .element2') normalScrollElements: (default null) If you want to avoid the auto scroll when scrolling over some elements, this is the option you need to use. (useful for maps, scrolling divs etc.) It requires a string with the jQuery selectors for those elements. (For example: normalScrollElements: '#element1, .element2') normalScrollElementTouchThreshold : (default 5) Defines the threshold for the number of hops up the html node tree Fullpage will test to see if normalScrollElements is a match to allow scrolling functionality on divs on a touch device. (For example: normalScrollElementTouchThreshold: 3) bigSectionsDestination: (default null) Defines how to scroll to a section which size is bigger than the viewport. By default fullPage.js scrolls to the top if you come from a section above the destination one and to the bottom if you come from a section below the destination one. Possible values are top, bottom, null. keyboardScrolling: (default true) Defines if the content can be navigated using the keyboard touchSensitivity: (default 5) Defines a percentage of the browsers window width/height, and how far a swipe must measure for navigating to the next section / slide continuousVertical: (default false) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section should scroll down to the first one or not, and if scrolling up in the first section should scroll up to the last one or not. Not compatible with loopTop or loopBottom. animateAnchor: (default true) Defines whether the load of the site when given an anchor (#) will scroll with animation to its destination or will directly load on the given section. recordHistory: (default true) Defines whether to push the state of the site to the browser's history. When set to true each section/slide of the site will act as a new page and the back and forward buttons of the browser will scroll the sections/slides to reach the previous or next state of the site. When set to false, the URL will keep changing but will have no effect ont he browser's history. This option is automatically turned off when using autoScrolling:false. menu: (default false) A selector can be used to specify the menu to link with the sections. This way the scrolling of the sections will activate the corresponding element in the menu using the class active. This won't generate a menu but will just add the active class to the element in the given menu with the corresponding anchor links. In order to link the elements of the menu with the sections, an HTML 5 data-tag (data-menuanchor) will be needed to use with the same anchor links as used within the sections. Example: <ul id=""myMenu"">     <li data-menuanchor=""firstPage"" class=""active""><a href=""#firstPage"">First section</a></li>     <li data-menuanchor=""secondPage""><a href=""#secondPage"">Second section</a></li>     <li data-menuanchor=""thirdPage""><a href=""#thirdPage"">Third section</a></li>     <li data-menuanchor=""fourthPage""><a href=""#fourthPage"">Fourth section</a></li> </ul> $('#fullpage').fullpage({     anchors: ['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage', 'fourthPage', 'lastPage'],     menu: '#myMenu' }); Note: the menu element should be placed outside the fullpage wrapper in order to avoid problem when using css3:true. Otherwise it will be appended to the body by the plugin itself. navigation: (default false) If set to true, it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles. navigationPosition: (default none) It can be set to left or right and defines which position the navigation bar will be shown (if using one). navigationTooltips: (default []) Defines the tooltips to show for the navigation circles in case they are being used. Example: navigationTooltips: ['firstSlide', 'secondSlide']. showActiveTooltip: (default false) Shows a persistent tooltip for the actively viewed section in the vertical navigation. slidesNavigation: (default false) If set to true it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles for each landscape slider on the site. slidesNavPosition: (default bottom) Defines the position for the landscape navigation bar for sliders. Admits top and bottom as values. You may want to modify the CSS styles to determine the distance from the top or bottom as well as any other style such as color. scrollOverflow: (default false) defines whether or not to create a scroll for the section/slide in case its content is bigger than the height of it. When set to true, your content will be wrapped by the plugin. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the afterRender callback. In case of setting it to true, it requires the vendor library scrolloverflow.min.js and it should be loaded before the fullPage.js plugin. For example: <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""vendors/scrolloverflow.min.js""></script> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""jquery.fullPage.js""></script> scrollOverflowOptions: when using scrollOverflow:true fullpage.js will make use of a forked and modified version of iScroll.js libary. You can customize the scrolling behaviour by providing fullpage.js with the iScroll.js options you want to use. Check its documentation for more info. sectionSelector: (default .section) Defines the jQuery selector used for the plugin sections. It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js.. slideSelector: (default .slide) Defines the jQuery selector used for the plugin slides. It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js. responsiveWidth: (default 0) A normal scroll (autoScrolling:false) will be used under the defined width in pixels. A class fp-responsive is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for his own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's width is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site. responsiveHeight: (default 0) A normal scroll (autoScrolling:false) will be used under the defined height in pixels. A class fp-responsive is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for his own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's height is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site. Methods You can see them in action here moveSectionUp() Demo Scrolls one section up: $.fn.fullpage.moveSectionUp(); moveSectionDown() Demo Scrolls one section down: $.fn.fullpage.moveSectionDown(); moveTo(section, slide) Demo Scrolls the page to the given section and slide. The first slide, the visible one by default, will have index 0. /*Scrolling to the section with the anchor link `firstSlide` and to the 2nd Slide */ $.fn.fullpage.moveTo('firstSlide', 2);  //Scrolling to the 3rd section in the site $.fn.fullpage.moveTo(3, 0);  //Which is the same as $.fn.fullpage.moveTo(3); silentMoveTo(section, slide) Demo Exactly the same as moveTo but in this case it performs the scroll without animation. A direct jump to the destination. /*Scrolling to the section with the anchor link `firstSlide` and to the 2nd Slide */ $.fn.fullpage.silentMoveTo('firstSlide', 2); moveSlideRight() Demo Scrolls the horizontal slider of the current section to the next slide: $.fn.fullpage.moveSlideRight(); moveSlideLeft() Demo Scrolls the horizontal slider of the current section to the previous slide: $.fn.fullpage.moveSlideLeft(); setAutoScrolling(boolean) Demo Sets the scrolling configuration in real time. Defines the way the page scrolling behaves. If it is set to true, it will use the ""automatic"" scrolling, otherwise, it will use the ""manual"" or ""normal"" scrolling of the site. Be careful when combining this option with scrollOverflow set to true, as it might be difficult to scroll using the mouse wheel or the trackpad when the section is scrollable. $.fn.fullpage.setAutoScrolling(false); setFitToSection(boolean) Demo Sets the value for the option fitToSection determining whether to fit the section in the screen or not. $.fn.fullpage.setFitToSection(false); setLockAnchors(boolean) Demo Sets the value for the option lockAnchors determining whether anchors will have any effect in the URL or not. $.fn.fullpage.setLockAnchors(false); setAllowScrolling(boolean, [directions]) Demo Adds or remove the possibility of scrolling through sections by using the mouse wheel/trackpad or touch gestures (which is active by default). Note this won't disable the keyboard scrolling. You would need to use setKeyboardScrolling for it. directions: (optional parameter) Admitted values: all, up, down, left, right or a combination of them separated by commas like down, right. It defines the direction for which the scrolling will be enabled or disabled. //disabling scrolling $.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false);  //disabling scrolling down $.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false, 'down');  //disabling scrolling down and right $.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false, 'down, right'); setKeyboardScrolling(boolean, [directions]) Demo Adds or remove the possibility of scrolling through sections by using the keyboard arrow keys (which is active by default). directions: (optional parameter) Admitted values: all, up, down, left, right or a combination of them separated by commas like down, right. It defines the direction for which the scrolling will be enabled or disabled. //disabling all keyboard scrolling $.fn.fullpage.setKeyboardScrolling(false);  //disabling keyboard scrolling down $.fn.fullpage.setKeyboardScrolling(false, 'down');  //disabling keyboard scrolling down and right $.fn.fullpage.setKeyboardScrolling(false, 'down, right'); setRecordHistory(boolean) Demo Defines whether to record the history for each hash change in the URL. $.fn.fullpage.setRecordHistory(false); setScrollingSpeed(milliseconds) Demo Defines the scrolling speed in milliseconds. $.fn.fullpage.setScrollingSpeed(700); destroy(type) Demo Destroys the plugin events and optionally its HTML markup and styles. Ideal to use when using AJAX to load content. type: can be empty or all. If all is passed, the HTML markup and styles used by fullpage.js will be removed. This way the original HTML markup, the one used before any plugin modification is made, will be maintained. //destroy any plugin event (scrolls, hashchange in the URL...) $.fn.fullpage.destroy();  //destroy any plugin event and any plugin modification done over your original HTML markup. $.fn.fullpage.destroy('all'); reBuild() Updates the DOM structure to fit the new window size or its contents. Ideal to use in combination with AJAX calls or external changes in the DOM structure of the site, specially when using scrollOverflow:true. $.fn.fullpage.reBuild(); setResponsive(boolean) Demo Sets the responsive mode of the page. When set to true the autoScrolling will be turned off and the result will be exactly the same one as when the responsiveWidth or responsiveHeight options get fired. Callbacks Demo You can see them in action here. afterLoad (anchorLink, index) Callback fired once the sections have been loaded, after the scrolling has ended. Parameters: anchorLink: anchorLink corresponding to the section. index: index of the section. Starting from 1. In case of not having anchorLinks defined in the plugin the index parameter would be the only one to use. Example:     $('#fullpage').fullpage({         anchors: ['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage', 'fourthPage', 'lastPage'],          afterLoad: function(anchorLink, index){             var loadedSection = $(this);              //using index             if(index == 3){                 alert(""Section 3 ended loading"");             }              //using anchorLink             if(anchorLink == 'secondSlide'){                 alert(""Section 2 ended loading"");             }         }     }); onLeave (index, nextIndex, direction) This callback is fired once the user leaves a section, in the transition to the new section. Returning false will cancel the move before it takes place. Parameters: index: index of the leaving section. Starting from 1. nextIndex: index of the destination section. Starting from 1. direction: it will take the values up or down depending on the scrolling direction. Example:     $('#fullpage').fullpage({         onLeave: function(index, nextIndex, direction){             var leavingSection = $(this);              //after leaving section 2             if(index == 2 && direction =='down'){                 alert(""Going to section 3!"");             }              else if(index == 2 && direction == 'up'){                 alert(""Going to section 1!"");             }         }     }); Cancelling the scroll before it takes place You can cancel the scroll by returning false on the onLeave callback:     $('#fullpage').fullpage({         onLeave: function(index, nextIndex, direction){             //it won't scroll if the destination is the 3rd section             if(nextIndex == 3){                 return false;             }         }     }); afterRender() This callback is fired just after the structure of the page is generated. This is the callback you want to use to initialize other plugins or fire any code which requires the document to be ready (as this plugin modifies the DOM to create the resulting structure). Example:     $('#fullpage').fullpage({         afterRender: function(){             var pluginContainer = $(this);             alert(""The resulting DOM structure is ready"");         }     }); afterResize() This callback is fired after resizing the browser's window. Just after the sections are resized. Example:     $('#fullpage').fullpage({         afterResize: function(){             var pluginContainer = $(this);             alert(""The sections have finished resizing"");         }     }); afterSlideLoad (anchorLink, index, slideAnchor, slideIndex) Callback fired once the slide of a section have been loaded, after the scrolling has ended. Parameters: anchorLink: anchorLink corresponding to the section. index: index of the section. Starting from 1. slideAnchor: anchor corresponding to the slide (in case there is) slideIndex: index of the slide. Starting from 1. (the default slide doesn't count as slide, but as a section) In case of not having anchorLinks defined for the slide or slides the slideIndex parameter would be the only one to use. Example:     $('#fullpage').fullpage({         anchors: ['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage', 'fourthPage', 'lastPage'],          afterSlideLoad: function( anchorLink, index, slideAnchor, slideIndex){             var loadedSlide = $(this);              //first slide of the second section             if(anchorLink == 'secondPage' && slideIndex == 1){                 alert(""First slide loaded"");             }              //second slide of the second section (supposing #secondSlide is the             //anchor for the second slide             if(index == 2 && slideIndex == 'secondSlide'){                 alert(""Second slide loaded"");             }         }     }); onSlideLeave (anchorLink, index, slideIndex, direction, nextSlideIndex) This callback is fired once the user leaves an slide to go to another, in the transition to the new slide. Returning false will cancel the move before it takes place. Parameters: anchorLink: anchorLink corresponding to the section. index: index of the section. Starting from 1. slideIndex: index of the slide. Starting from 0. direction: takes the values right or left depending on the scrolling direction. nextSlideIndex: index of the destination slide. Starting from 0. Example:     $('#fullpage').fullpage({         onSlideLeave: function( anchorLink, index, slideIndex, direction, nextSlideIndex){             var leavingSlide = $(this);              //leaving the first slide of the 2nd Section to the right             if(index == 2 && slideIndex == 0 && direction == 'right'){                 alert(""Leaving the fist slide!!"");             }              //leaving the 3rd slide of the 2nd Section to the left             if(index == 2 && slideIndex == 2 && direction == 'left'){                 alert(""Going to slide 2! "");             }         }     }); Cancelling a move before it takes place You can cancel a move by returning false on the onSlideLeave callback. Same as when canceling a movement with onLeave.

Apr 20, 2013 README.md jQuery-menu-aim menu-aim is a jQuery plugin for dropdown menus that can differentiate between a user trying hover over a dropdown item vs trying to navigate into a submenu's contents. Try a demo. This problem is normally solved using timeouts and delays. menu-aim tries to solve this by detecting the direction of the user's mouse movement. This can make for quicker transitions when navigating up and down the menu. The experience is hopefully similar to amazon.com/'s ""Shop by Department"" dropdown. Use like so:  $(""#menu"").menuAim({      activate: $.noop,  // fired on row activation      deactivate: $.noop  // fired on row deactivation  });  ...to receive events when a menu's row has been purposefully (de)activated. The following options can be passed to menuAim. All functions execute with the relevant row's HTML element as the execution context ('this'):  .menuAim({      // Function to call when a row is purposefully activated. Use this      // to show a submenu's content for the activated row.      activate: function() {},       // Function to call when a row is deactivated.      deactivate: function() {},       // Function to call when mouse enters a menu row. Entering a row      // does not mean the row has been activated, as the user may be      // mousing over to a submenu.      enter: function() {},       // Function to call when mouse exits a menu row.      exit: function() {},       // Function to call when mouse exits the entire menu. If this returns      // true, the current row's deactivation event and callback function      // will be fired. Otherwise, if this isn't supplied or it returns      // false, the currently activated row will stay activated when the      // mouse leaves the menu entirely.      exitMenu: function() {},       // Selector for identifying which elements in the menu are rows      // that can trigger the above events. Defaults to ""> li"".      rowSelector: ""> li"",       // You may have some menu rows that aren't submenus and therefore      // shouldn't ever need to ""activate."" If so, filter submenu rows w/      // this selector. Defaults to ""*"" (all elements).      submenuSelector: ""*"",       // Direction the submenu opens relative to the main menu. This      // controls which direction is ""forgiving"" as the user moves their      // cursor from the main menu into the submenu. Can be one of ""right"",      // ""left"", ""above"", or ""below"". Defaults to ""right"".      submenuDirection: ""right""  });  menu-aim assumes that you are using a menu with submenus that expand to the menu's right. It will fire events when the user's mouse enters a new dropdown item and when that item is being intentionally hovered over. Want an example to learn from? Check out example/example.html -- it has a working dropdown for you to play with: Play with the above example full of fun monkey pictures by opening example/example.html after downloading the repo. FAQ What's the license? MIT. Does it support horizontal menus or submenus that open to the left? Yup. Check out the submenuDirection option above. I work at a big company that requires a version number on this third party code before I can use it. Do you have a version number? Sure, current version: 1.1 I'm not nearly bored enough.

It was designed for an application where there are hundreds of elements that may show a context menu - so intialization speed and memory usage are kept fairly small. It also allows to register context menus without providing actual markup, as $.contextMenu generates DOMElements as needed. features - demo - documentation Dependencies jQuery >=1.8.2 jQuery UI position (optional but recommended) Usage register contextMenu from javascript: $.contextMenu({     // define which elements trigger this menu     selector: "".with-cool-menu"",     // define the elements of the menu     items: {         foo: {name: ""Foo"", callback: function(key, opt){ alert(""Foo!""); }},         bar: {name: ""Bar"", callback: function(key, opt){ alert(""Bar!"") }}     }     // there's more, have a look at the demos and docs... }); have a look at the demos. HTML5 Compatibility Firefox 8 implemented contextmenu using the <menuitem> tags for menu-structure. The specs however state that <command> tags should be used for this purpose. $.contextMenu accepts both. Firefox 8 does not yet fully implement the contextmenu specification (Ticket #617528). The elements a, button, input and option usable as commands are being ignored altogether. It also doesn't (optically) distinguish between checkbox/radio and regular commands (Bug #705292). contextmenu specs command specs Browser support according to caniuse.com Note: While the specs note <option>s to be renderd as regular commands, $.contextMenu will render an actual <select>. import contextMenu from HTML5 <menu>: $.contextMenu(""html5""); Interaction Principles You're (obviously) able to use the context menu with your mouse. Once it is opened, you can also use the keyboard to (fully) navigate it. ↑ (up) previous item in list, will skip disabled elements and wrap around ↓ (down) next item in, will skip disabled elements and wrap around → (right) dive into sub-menu ← (left) rise from sub-menu ↵ (return) invoke command ⇥ (tab) next item or input element, will skip disabled elements and wrap around ⇪ ⇥ (shift tab) previous item or input element, will skip disabled elements and wrap around ⎋ (escape) close menu ⌴ (space) captured and ignore to avoid page scrolling (for consistency with native menus) ⇞ (page up) captured and ignore to avoid page scrolling (for consistency with native menus) ⇟ (page down) captured and ignore to avoid page scrolling (for consistency with native menus) ↖ (home) first item in list, will skip disabled elements ↘ (end) last item in list, will skip disabled elements Besides the obvious, browser also react to alphanumeric key strokes. Hitting r in a context menu will make Firefox (8) reload the page immediately. Chrome selects the option to see infos on the page, Safari selects the option to print the document. Awesome, right? Until trying the same on Windows I did not realize that the browsers were using the access-key for this. I would've preferred typing the first character of something, say ""s"" for ""save"" and then iterate through all the commands beginning with s. But that's me - what do I know about UX? Anyways, $.contextMenu now also supports accesskey handling.

(thanks @RareDevil) Add check that root.$layer exists, to prevent calling hide() on an defined object. (thanks @andreasrosdal) 2.0.0 (October 28th 2015) This version changes the default names of the icon classes in order to stop CSS conflicts with frameworks which define the class 'icon'. In order to keep the icon names the same as before this change you can change the defaults on the classnames for the icons (docs on classNames option). The classnames will probably be ""context-menu-icon-*"" as proposed earlier by @rodneyrehm. You can not use SASS to customize your contextmenu. The gulp command build-icons takes all the SVG icons from src/icons and builds them into a font. In order to this we needed to break backwards compatibility. This does mean the new CSS does not have the old .icon class defined which makes it a lot more stable within CSS frameworks. The first revision of the documentation is found here. The 1.x branch will be maintained for a while with bugfixes. But support for 1.x will be dropped in the coming months. Reverted the change from 1.7.0: .html() changed back to .text() since it is an security issue (thanks @arai-a) 1.10.1 (October 25th 2015) Added gulp command (integration-test-paths) to change the paths in the integration tests to the correct path after they are overwritten by the documentation generator. Make sure the contextmenu is not outside the client area by (thanks to @arai-a) Update jQuery dependecy so that it will not result in double installation of jQuery when using npm (thanks to @fredericlb) 1.9.1 (October 11th 2015) Fixed a bug where the classNames options would fail on a submenu. New documentation site and generation using couscous 1.9.0 (October 1st 2015) Make classes configurable for those that can easily conflict. See the docs on classNames option. This also prepares to change classnames to non conflicting defaults so the hassle with frameworks as bootstrap will stop. Fix for handling of seperator string. It threw an error on the protected property of String.$node Fix for opening the contextmenu at coordinate 0,0 (by Andreme) Fixed check for jQuery UI (Issue #182) Updated doc for function argument for icon 1.8.1 (September 14th 2015) Updated readme.

Easy customization. CSS transforms & transitions. Just 2 Kb! (min & gzip) Demo Check out the demo to see it in action (on your mobile or emulate touches on your browser). Installation Slideout is available on cdnjs <script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/slideout/0.1.12/slideout.min.js""></script> Also you can use one of many package managers $ npm install slideout  $ spm install slideout  $ bower install slideout.js  $ component install mango/slideout  Usage Implementing Slideout.js into your project is easy. First of all, you'll need to create your markup. You should have a menu (#menu) and a main content (#panel) into your body. <nav id=""menu"">   <header>     <h2>Menu</h2>   </header> </nav>  <main id=""panel"">   <header>     <h2>Panel</h2>   </header> </main> Add the Slideout.js styles (index.css) in your web application. body {   width: 100%;   height: 100%; }  .slideout-menu {   position: fixed;   left: 0;   top: 0;   bottom: 0;   right: 0;   z-index: 0;   width: 256px;   overflow-y: auto;   -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;   display: none; }  .slideout-panel {   position:relative;   z-index: 1;   will-change: transform; }  .slideout-open, .slideout-open body, .slideout-open .slideout-panel {   overflow: hidden; }  .slideout-open .slideout-menu {   display: block; } Then you just include Slideout.js and create a new instance with some options: <script src=""dist/slideout.min.js""></script> <script>   var slideout = new Slideout({     'panel': document.getElementById('panel'),     'menu': document.getElementById('menu'),     'padding': 256,     'tolerance': 70   }); </script> Full example <!doctype html> <html lang=""en"">   <head>     <meta charset=""utf-8"">     <title>Slideout Demo</title>     <meta http-equiv=""cleartype"" content=""on"">     <meta name=""MobileOptimized"" content=""320"">     <meta name=""HandheldFriendly"" content=""True"">     <meta name=""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"" content=""yes"">     <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"">     <style>       body {         width: 100%;         height: 100%;       }        .slideout-menu {         position: fixed;         left: 0;         top: 0;         bottom: 0;         right: 0;         z-index: 0;         width: 256px;         overflow-y: auto;         -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;         display: none;       }        .slideout-panel {         position:relative;         z-index: 1;         will-change: transform;       }        .slideout-open,       .slideout-open body,       .slideout-open .slideout-panel {         overflow: hidden;       }        .slideout-open .slideout-menu {         display: block;       }     </style>   </head>   <body>      <nav id=""menu"">       <h2>Menu</h2>     </nav>      <main id=""panel"">       <header>         <button class=""toggle-button"">☰</button>         <h2>Panel</h2>       </header>     </main>      <script src=""dist/slideout.min.js""></script>     <script>       var slideout = new Slideout({         'panel': document.getElementById('panel'),         'menu': document.getElementById('menu'),         'padding': 256,         'tolerance': 70       });        // Toggle button       document.querySelector('.toggle-button').addEventListener('click', function() {         slideout.toggle();       });     </script>    </body> </html> Browser Support Chrome (IOS, Android, desktop) Firefox (Android, desktop) Safari (IOS, Android, desktop) Opera (desktop) IE 10+ (desktop) API Slideout(options) Create a new instance of Slideout. options (Object) - Options to customize a new instance of Slideout. options.panel (HTMLElement) - The DOM element that contains all your application content (.slideout-panel). options.menu (HTMLElement) - The DOM element that contains your menu application (.slideout-menu).

You should define left: auto on the class .slideout-menu. .slideout-menu {   left: auto; } Then, use the side option with the value right. var slideout = new Slideout({   'panel': document.getElementById('content'),   'menu': document.getElementById('menu'),   'side': 'right' }); How to enable slideout only on mobile devices. You should use mediaqueries: @media screen and (min-width: 780px) {   .slideout-panel {     margin-left: 256px;   }    .slideout-menu {     display: block;   }    .btn-hamburger {     display: none;   } } Demo: http://codepen.io/pazguille/pen/mEdQvX How to use slideout with a fixed header.

It has several features including: Automatically creates HTML table and loads records from server using AJAX. Creates 'create new record' jQueryUI dialog form. When user creates a record, it sends data to server using AJAX and adds the same record to the table in the page. Creates 'edit record' jQueryUI dialog form. When user edits a record, it updates server using AJAX and updates all cells on the table in the page. Allow user to 'delete a record' by jQueryUI dialog based confirmation. When user deletes a record, it deletes the record from server using AJAX and deletes the record from the table in the page. Shows animations for create/delete/edit operations on the table. Supports server side paging using AJAX. Supports server side sorting using AJAX. Supports master/child tables. Allows user to select rows. Allows user to resize columns. Allows user to show/hide columns. Exposes some events to enable validation with forms. It can be localized easily. All styling of table and forms are defined in a CSS file, so you can easily change style of everything to use plugin in your pages. CSS file is well defined and commented. It comes with pre-defined color themes. It is not depended on any server side technology. It is platform independed and works on all common browsers. Notes lib folder contains files necessary to use jTable. dev folder contains parts of library helpful for development of jTable. See http://www.jtable.org for documentation, demos, themes and more...

No changes to your HTML/CSS are required, it just works. Supports floating the header while scrolling within the window or while scrolling within a container with overflow. Supports responsive tables. 😻My cat loves it😻 Install Package managers npm install floatthead bower install floatThead Download code Latest Release (zip) Via CDN http://cdnjs.com/libraries/floatthead/ http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!jquery.floatthead For java people Webjar Wrappers angularjs directive by @brandon-barker yii2 framework wrapper by @bluezed Things this plugin does: Works on tables within a scrollable container or whole window scrolling Works with responsive table wrappers Works with dynamically hidden/added/removed columns Doesn't clone the thead - so your events stay bound Doesn't mess with your styles, and doesnt require any css Works with border-collapse variants, weird margins, padding and borders Works with libs like datatables, perfect-scrollbar, bootstrap3, and many more Header can be floated with position:absolute which adds a wrapper, or position:fixed which does not. Both have their pros and cons. By default the best option is chosen based on your configuration Things this plugin does NOT do: Does not float the footer Does not let you lock the first column like in excel Safari and mobile safari are not supported. It might work, or it might not, depending on your markup and safari version. Common Pitfalls If you use css and html best practices, this plugin will work. If you are stuck in 1999, you better read the faq. How to get help with the floatThead All issues should be reported through github. Coffee/Beer donations help are welcome ;) Requirements: jQuery 1.8.x or better (1.9 compliant) (or jQuery 1.7.x and jQuery UI core) Supported Browsers: IE8 or better (must read this for ANY Internet Exploder integrations) Chrome, Firefox (all versions from last 3 years) Change Log see CHANGELOG.md Who is using floatThead ? around 20K hits on guthub cod search http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/ staticsitegenerators.net netdisco http://sourceforge.net/p/netdisco/netdisco-ng/ci/213352d54ee8e71cbca5ae2c1c75696800c4216b/ pylyglot https://github.com/omaciel/pylyglot/tree/master/pylyglot/static/js django-sql-explorer https://github.com/epantry/django-sql-explorer/commit/34ae345325a1e07ff952800fcd6dc5bddac5e3f2- You are still reading this?

The library has a small footprint and no dependencies except jQuery (1.8+). The library has the following widgets: w2layout w2grid w2toolbar w2sidebar w2tabs w2form w2fields w2popup w2utils The complete library is only 69Kb (minified & gzipped) Who Uses It If you're using w2ui I'd love to hear about it, please email to vitmalina@gmail.com name of your project and a link to a public website or demo and I will add it to the list. List of projects that use w2ui Quick Start Current stable version is 1.4. You can: Download from here: http://w2ui.com Install using bower bower install w2ui  To start using the library you need to include into your page: w2ui-1.4.js (or w2ui-1.4.min.js) w2ui-1.4.css (or w2ui-1.4.min.css) All the widgets and their css classes are defined inside of these two files. There is no image dependencies, some images are embedded into CSS file. There is no requirement for a server side language. Node, Java, PHP, ASP, Perl or .NET all will work, as long as you can return JSON format from the server (or write a converter into JSON format on the client). Getting Started Guide Documentation & Demos You can find documentation and demos here: http://w2ui.com/web/docs - documentation http://w2ui.com/web/demos - demos Bug Tracking Have a bug or a feature request? Please open an issue here https://github.com/vitmalina/w2ui/issues. Please make sure that the same issue was not previously submitted by someone else. Building I have switched to Grunt as a build tool. You will find Gruntfile.js in the root. You still can build with ANT if you are more comfortable with it. Both processes will produces same w2ui.js and w2ui.css files. Grunt has a few more tasks, such as watch, to auto compiles less and js files as you develop. Both tools will do the following: Compile LESS files Concatenate and minify CSS files Concatenate, uglify and minify JS files To use ANT, you will need to install NodeJS and NPM, then run the following command to install dependencies sudo npm install less -g sudo npm install clean-css -g sudo npm install uglify-js@1 -g  To use Grunt, you will still need to install NodeJS and NPM, then run npm install that will install all dependencies as they are described in package.json file. npm install  File Structure - dist           - compiled JS and CSS files - src            - source JS files   - kickstart    - copy of another project used with the demos (not part of w2ui itself)   - less         - LESS files (source for css) - demos          - all demos, same as on the website - libs           - auxiliary libraries (jquery, codemirror, etc.) used in the demos (not part of w2ui itself) - server         - example implementations for a server implementation communicating with w2ui instances - test           - feature testing files - qa             - some qunit test  Contributing Your contributions are welcome. However, few things you need to know before contribution: Please check out latest code before changing anything. It is harder to merge if your changes will not merge clean. If you are changing JS files - do all changes in /src folder If you are changing CSS files - do all changes in LESS in /src/less/src If you want to help with unit test - do all changes in /qa If you want to change documentation - do all changes in /docs If you want to add demos - do all changes in /demos Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Apr 29, 2014 package.json New gulpfile and tasks. Sep 20, 2014 README.md FLUIDITY A fully responsive css framework that is impossibly small HTML is almost 100% responsive out of the box. This stylesheet patches the remaining holes to get to 100% and in just 247 minified bytes. Let's make the web just a bit more responsive shall we? Installing fluidity Production Just include the fluidity css file in the head of your html file: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/fluidity.min.css""> For elements that need to retain widths that might be wider than a device's viewport (i.e tables), wrap them in a div with the class 'overflow-container' like so:   <div class=""overflow-container"">     <table>       ...     </table>   </div> Development If you want to develop with the uncompressed version, include instead: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/fluidity.css""> Available build / dev tools If you'd like to use the available build tools just run: cd fluidity npm install -g gulp npm install gulp  Gulp Tasks Gulp is a JavaScript task runner. http://gulpjs.com There are a few common tasks that gulp takes care of here: Livereload CSS minification Autoprefixer Sass Lints the compiled css Run these from the root directory of the project. The command gulp  runs a live reload server and starts sass compilation while running csslint, while gulp production  also minifies the css.

It uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to offer modern solutions for building layouts, display common interface elements and implement interactive features that are content-centric and user friendly for both your audience and your designers & developers. Ink is part of SAPO's Open Source Software initiative. Current Version: 3.1.10 You can read our full documentation, examples and recipes in http://ink.sapo.pt Getting started Let's get you started with Ink right away. Here's what you need to know and do: Download the latest release. Check the recipes we provide in the dist/cookbook folder and choose one to start from or use quick-start.html as a blank slate. Make sure you have ink.css, ink-ie.css and ink.js included somewhere in the <head>. Add your own css and scripts to carry all your project-specific changes. You can use quick-start.css from the dist/css folder. It already contains the same media queries as Ink. Keep coming back to the documentation to help you along the way. That's it! You'll see how easy it is once you pick it up. Repository Branches master - The master branch contains the latest release as its HEAD and all previous releases as tags named as the version numbers. staging - The staging branch is a semi-stable branch containing code from the develop branch which is under testing and will, eventually, go into the next release. develop* - The develop branch contains our latest code that will eventually lead to a new release and tag on master. * This branch is very likely to contain code that is not fully functional or documented. Support requests for problems with this branch will have the lowest priority so, use at your own risk. Structure Since version 2.3.0 we've moved things around in order keep source code from distribution code separated: JS dist/js CSS dist/css Sass source src/sass Js source src/js We've also unified our build system using Grunt and Bower. So, building from source is now a lot easier. Building from source Required tools If you want to build from our source code, you'll need to install a few things: Node.js Ruby Compass Grunt Bower OS X Install Homebrew: ruby -e ""$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)""  Install Node.js: brew install node  Install Grunt: npm install -g grunt-cli  Install Bower: npm install -g bower  Install Compass: sudo gem update --system && sudo gem install compass  Move into Inks folder and install remaining build tools: npm install  Ubuntu Install Grunt: sudo npm install -g grunt-cli  Install Bower: sudo npm install -g bower  Install Ruby: sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems  Install Compass: sudo gem install compass  Move into Inks folder and install remaining build tools: npm install  Windows If you don't need to rebuild Javascript code you can just use Scout which is a nice, free and cross platform Sass/Compass compiler. Building on Windows is a lot trickier so we won't get into details on how to install all the required tools. Instead here's a list of useful pages you'll need to read while trying this endeavour: Getting started with Sass and Compass Grunt Building Grunt exposes these build tasks: grunt - Gets third party dependencies, deletes previously built js and css, recompiles and minifies the css, rebuilds and minifies the js bundle files. grunt test - Runs Inks js test suite. grunt css - Deletes previously built css, recompiles and minifies the css. grunt js - Deletes previously built js, builds and minifies the js bundle files. grunt watch - Watches for changes in either css or js files and calls grunt js and grunt css grunt watch:css - Watches for changes in Sass files and calls grunt css grunt watch:js - Watches for changes in JS files and calls grunt js Documentation The documentation is no longer distributed with Ink releases. We've completely rewritten or documentation and are now running our site on Github pages using Jekyll.

Jan 28, 2016 README.md Webplate Framework Webplate is an awesome front-end framework that lets you stay focused on building your site or app all the while remaining really easy to use. Getting Started Simply drop the Webplate directory into your web project and include the start.js file before your ending body tag. Below is an example of this and note that an id of webplate is required. <body style=""display:none;"">     /* Your content goes here */     <script id=""webplate"" src=""webplate/start.js""></script> </body>  The body tag style attribute is used to prevent CSS style snapping on load and is highly recommended. Simple Page Loader If you would like a page loader to display while your project files load, simply wrap your content in a div with id webplate-content. See an example below. <body>     <div id=""webplate-content"" style=""display:none;"">         /* Your content goes here */     </div>     <script id=""webplate"" src=""webplate/start.js""></script> </body>  Load Your Project Files All web projects include a combination of CSS and Javascript and Webplate makes it incredibly easy to load these using a simple configuration file. You can find this file at webplate/project/config.json. Below is an example of what you might typically see. {     ""project"": {         ""css"": [""welcome.css"", ""theme.css""],         ""js"": [""min/welcome.min.js""],     } }  You will notice that a comma delimited list allows you to load more than one file and that the Webplate path is not required. This is because Webplate automatically knows where to look inside the project directory. You can also load different files on different pages. Lets Go To The Next Level Before you have even started, Webplate has already loaded up Modernizr, Normalize.css, Typeplate, Velocity.js and icon font support at a minimal size. This takes away most of the set up time and acts like a kind of advanced boilerplate. This will get you up and running for most projects but if you want to include Webplate components like Buttons, Forms or Modals or perhaps you want to even start delving into Webplate's automatic Bower, SASS and Grunt intergration then just read over some of the online documentation and become a bonafide pro. Browser Support: IE9+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera Documentation Webplate has many aspects to it so for more information view the comprehensive online documentation.

Making them responsive shouldn't add to the headache. A few simple, but solid patterns are all that's needed to optimize emails for small screens. That's what Cerberus is. It's just a few responsive email patterns that go a long way. The code blocks are compartmentalized so that they may be used, combined, and nested to build an email. Each template is annotated and has good support among popular email clients.

A fluid grid of square units using HTML and CSS. Fluid Squares preserves a unit's square proportion within a fluid layout. The number of columns also reduce to suit browser or device width using CSS media queries. It works on all modern desktop browsers. Media queries are written Mobile First. IE8 doesn't support media queries, so the css3-mediaqueries.js polyfill is temporarily included. See www.fluidsquares.com for more. What problem does Fluid Squares fix? Without a fix, the result of reducing a browser window's width squashes a fluid grid's squares into rectangles. To fix this each unit's padding-bottom size is set to match its width in percentages. On top of that each unit is a percentage of the global container to determine how many columns there are. Setting a unit's width to 25% and padding-bottom to 25% will give you four units in a row that will remain square regardless of screen size or browser window resizing. The ingredients HTML The basic structure of each unit is a div for content, which is nested in an anchor element: <a href=""url""> <div>content</div> </a>  If you don't want the entire unit to be a link, a class has been created for that purpose. Just remove the anchor element and add class=""category"" to the div instead. <div class=""category"">content</div>  CSS Media queries control the number of columns displayed (1, 2, 3, and 4) on browser resize, as well as providing fine control over font sizes. It includes a cut down CSS reset to suit this bare bones grid. Replace with a fresh Reset or Normalize and customise to suit your own needs. No wrapper? It uses the body tag as a wrapper, but would certainly work within a standard div wrapper or HTML5 block elements. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

It will set some fake properties to spoof the touch detection of some libraries, and triggers touchstart, touchmove and touchend events on the mouse target. <script src=""touch-emulator.js""></script> <script> TouchEmulator(); </script> function log(ev) {  console.log(ev); }  document.body.addEventListener('touchstart', log, false); document.body.addEventListener('touchmove', log, false); document.body.addEventListener('touchend', log, false); Also, the script includes polyfills for document.createTouch and document.createTouchList. How it works It listens to the mousedown, mousemove and mouseup events, and translates them to touch events. If the mouseevent has the shiftKey property to true, it enables multi-touch. The script also prevents the following mouse events on the page: mousedown, mouseenter, mouseleave, mousemove, mouseout, mouseover and mouseup. Web platform tests The script has been tested with the w3c web platform tests and passes all tests, except these; assert_true: event is a TouchEvent event expected true got false We trigger an event of the type Event assert_equals: touch list is of type TouchList expected ""[object TouchList]"" but got ""[object Array]"" assert_equals: touch is of type Touch expected ""[object Touch]"" but got ""[object Object]"" Bookmarklet javascript:!function(a){var b=a.createElement(""script"");b.onload=function(){TouchEmulator()},b.src=""//cdn.rawgit.com/hammerjs/touchemulator/0.0.2/touch-emulator.js"",a.body.appendChild(b)}(document); Options TouchEmulator.template = Function(touch) Change the css properties of the rendered touches.

Inspiration Have you ever wanted a drag and drop library that just works? That doesn't just depend on bloated frameworks, that has great support? That actually understands where to place the elements when they are dropped? That doesn't need you to do a zillion things to get it to work? Well, so did I! Features Super easy to set up No bloated dependencies Figures out sort order on its own A shadow where the item would be dropped offers visual feedback Touch events! Seamlessly handles clicks without any configuration Install You can get it on npm. npm install dragula --save Or bower, too. bower install dragula --save Or a CDN. <script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dragula/$VERSION/dragula.min.js'></script> If you're not using either package manager, you can use dragula by downloading the files in the dist folder. We strongly suggest using npm, though. Including the JavaScript There's a caveat to dragula. You shouldn't include it in the <head> of your web applications. It's bad practice to place scripts in the <head>, and as such dragula makes no effort to support this use case. Place dragula in the <body>, instead. Including the CSS! There's a few CSS styles you need to incorporate in order for dragula to work as expected. You can add them by including dist/dragula.css or dist/dragula.min.css in your document. If you're using Stylus, you can include the styles using the directive below. @import 'node_modules/dragula/dragula' Usage Dragula provides the easiest possible API to make drag and drop a breeze in your applications. dragula(containers?, options?) By default, dragula will allow the user to drag an element in any of the containers and drop it in any other container in the list. If the element is dropped anywhere that's not one of the containers, the event will be gracefully cancelled according to the revertOnSpill and removeOnSpill options. Note that dragging is only triggered on left clicks, and only if no meta keys are pressed. The example below allows the user to drag elements from left into right, and from right into left. dragula([document.querySelector('#left'), document.querySelector('#right')]); You can also provide an options object. Here's an overview of the default values. dragula(containers, {   isContainer: function (el) {     return false; // only elements in drake.containers will be taken into account   },   moves: function (el, source, handle, sibling) {     return true; // elements are always draggable by default   },   accepts: function (el, target, source, sibling) {     return true; // elements can be dropped in any of the `containers` by default   },   invalid: function (el, handle) {     return false; // don't prevent any drags from initiating by default   },   direction: 'vertical',             // Y axis is considered when determining where an element would be dropped   copy: false,                       // elements are moved by default, not copied   copySortSource: false,             // elements in copy-source containers can be reordered   revertOnSpill: false,              // spilling will put the element back where it was dragged from, if this is true   removeOnSpill: false,              // spilling will `.remove` the element, if this is true   mirrorContainer: document.body,    // set the element that gets mirror elements appended   ignoreInputTextSelection: true     // allows users to select input text, see details below }); You can omit the containers argument and add containers dynamically later on. var drake = dragula({   copy: true }); drake.containers.push(container); You can also set the containers from the options object. var drake = dragula({ containers: containers }); And you could also not set any arguments, which defaults to a drake without containers and with the default options. var drake = dragula(); The options are detailed below. options.containers Setting this option is effectively the same as passing the containers in the first argument to dragula(containers, options). options.isContainer Besides the containers that you pass to dragula, or the containers you dynamically push or unshift from drake.containers, you can also use this method to specify any sort of logic that defines what is a container for this particular drake instance. The example below dynamically treats all DOM elements with a CSS class of dragula-container as dragula containers for this drake. var drake = dragula({   isContainer: function (el) {     return el.classList.contains('dragula-container');   } }); options.moves You can define a moves method which will be invoked with (el, source, handle, sibling) whenever an element is clicked. If this method returns false, a drag event won't begin, and the event won't be prevented either. The handle element will be the original click target, which comes in handy to test if that element is an expected ""drag handle"". options.accepts You can set accepts to a method with the following signature: (el, target, source, sibling). It'll be called to make sure that an element el, that came from container source, can be dropped on container target before a sibling element. The sibling can be null, which would mean that the element would be placed as the last element in the container. Note that if options.copy is set to true, el will be set to the copy, instead of the originally dragged element. Also note that the position where a drag starts is always going to be a valid place where to drop the element, even if accepts returned false for all cases. options.copy If copy is set to true (or a method that returns true), items will be copied rather than moved. This implies the following differences: Event Move Copy drag Element will be concealed from source Nothing happens drop Element will be moved into target Element will be cloned into target remove Element will be removed from DOM Nothing happens cancel Element will stay in source Nothing happens If a method is passed, it'll be called whenever an element starts being dragged in order to decide whether it should follow copy behavior or not. Consider the following example. copy: function (el, source) {   return el.className === 'you-may-copy-us'; } options.copySortSource If copy is set to true (or a method that returns true) and copySortSource is true as well, users will be able to sort elements in copy-source containers. copy: true, copySortSource: true options.revertOnSpill By default, spilling an element outside of any containers will move the element back to the drop position previewed by the feedback shadow. Setting revertOnSpill to true will ensure elements dropped outside of any approved containers are moved back to the source element where the drag event began, rather than stay at the drop position previewed by the feedback shadow. options.removeOnSpill By default, spilling an element outside of any containers will move the element back to the drop position previewed by the feedback shadow. Setting removeOnSpill to true will ensure elements dropped outside of any approved containers are removed from the DOM. Note that remove events won't fire if copy is set to true. options.direction When an element is dropped onto a container, it'll be placed near the point where the mouse was released. If the direction is 'vertical', the default value, the Y axis will be considered. Otherwise, if the direction is 'horizontal', the X axis will be considered. options.invalid You can provide an invalid method with a (el, handle) signature. This method should return true for elements that shouldn't trigger a drag. The handle argument is the element that was clicked, while el is the item that would be dragged. Here's the default implementation, which doesn't prevent any drags. function invalidTarget (el, handle) {   return false; } Note that invalid will be invoked on the DOM element that was clicked and every parent up to immediate children of a drake container. As an example, you could set invalid to return false whenever the clicked element (or any of its parents) is an anchor tag. invalid: function (el, handle) {   return el.tagName === 'A'; } options.mirrorContainer The DOM element where the mirror element displayed while dragging will be appended to. Defaults to document.body. options.ignoreInputTextSelection When this option is enabled, if the user clicks on an input element the drag won't start until their mouse pointer exits the input. This translates into the user being able to select text in inputs contained inside draggable elements, and still drag the element by moving their mouse outside of the input -- so you get the best of both worlds. This option is enabled by default. Turn it off by setting it to false. If its disabled your users won't be able to select text in inputs within dragula containers with their mouse. API The dragula method returns a tiny object with a concise API. We'll refer to the API returned by dragula as drake. drake.containers This property contains the collection of containers that was passed to dragula when building this drake instance. You can push more containers and splice old containers at will. drake.dragging This property will be true whenever an element is being dragged. drake.start(item) Enter drag mode without a shadow. This method is most useful when providing complementary keyboard shortcuts to an existing drag and drop solution. Even though a shadow won't be created at first, the user will get one as soon as they click on item and start dragging it around. Note that if they click and drag something else, .end will be called before picking up the new item. drake.end() Gracefully end the drag event as if using the last position marked by the preview shadow as the drop target. The proper cancel or drop event will be fired, depending on whether the item was dropped back where it was originally lifted from (which is essentially a no-op that's treated as a cancel event). drake.cancel(revert) If an element managed by drake is currently being dragged, this method will gracefully cancel the drag action. You can also pass in revert at the method invocation level, effectively producing the same result as if revertOnSpill was true. Note that a ""cancellation"" will result in a cancel event only in the following scenarios. revertOnSpill is true Drop target (as previewed by the feedback shadow) is the source container and the item is dropped in the same position where it was originally dragged from drake.remove() If an element managed by drake is currently being dragged, this method will gracefully remove it from the DOM. drake.on (Events) The drake is an event emitter. The following events can be tracked using drake.on(type, listener): Event Name Listener Arguments Event Description drag el, source el was lifted from source dragend el Dragging event for el ended with either cancel, remove, or drop drop el, target, source, sibling el was dropped into target before a sibling element, and originally came from source cancel el, container, source el was being dragged but it got nowhere and went back into container, its last stable parent; el originally came from source remove el, container, source el was being dragged but it got nowhere and it was removed from the DOM. Its last stable parent was container, and originally came from source shadow el, container, source el, the visual aid shadow, was moved into container. May trigger many times as the position of el changes, even within the same container; el originally came from source over el, container, source el is over container, and originally came from source out el, container, source el was dragged out of container or dropped, and originally came from source cloned clone, original, type DOM element original was cloned as clone, of type ('mirror' or 'copy'). Fired for mirror images and when copy: true drake.canMove(item) Returns whether the drake instance can accept drags for a DOM element item. This method returns true when all the conditions outlined below are met, and false otherwise. item is a child of one of the specified containers for drake item passes the pertinent invalid checks item passes a moves check drake.destroy() Removes all drag and drop events used by dragula to manage drag and drop between the containers. If .destroy is called while an element is being dragged, the drag will be effectively cancelled. CSS Dragula uses only four CSS classes. Their purpose is quickly explained below, but you can check dist/dragula.css to see the corresponding CSS rules. gu-unselectable is added to the mirrorContainer element when dragging. You can use it to style the mirrorContainer while something is being dragged. gu-transit is added to the source element when its mirror image is dragged. It just adds opacity to it. gu-mirror is added to the mirror image. It handles fixed positioning and z-index (and removes any prior margins on the element). Note that the mirror image is appended to the mirrorContainer, not to its initial container. Keep that in mind when styling your elements with nested rules, like .list .item { padding: 10px; }. gu-hide is a helper class to apply display: none to an element.

For example, assuming you have a googlemapsapi.js file: define(['async!http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?v=3&sensor=false'], function() {}); Next you have to define the dependency for gmaps.js: require.config({   paths: {     ""googlemapsapi"": ""googlemapsapi"",   },   shim: {     gmaps: {       deps: [""googlemapsapi""],       exports: ""GMaps""     }   } }); Also, you can use the googlemaps-amd plugin.

See http://polymaps.org for more details. This is the master branch, which contains the Polymaps source code. If you're looking for the Polymaps website, you should checkout the gh-pages branch instead. Viewing Examples You'll find lots of Polymaps examples in the suitably-named examples directory. Open any of the HTML files there in your browser to view the examples, or open them in your text editor of choice to view the source. Most of the examples are replicated on the Polymaps website, though a few of them are only visible locally. Some of the examples depend on third-party libraries, such as jQuery. These third-party libraries are not required to use Polymaps but can certainly make it easier! All third-party libraries should be stored in the lib directory, with an associated LICENSE file and optional README. Filing Bugs We use GitHub to track issues with Polymaps. You can search for existing issues, and file new issues, here: http://github.com/simplegeo/polymaps/issues You are welcome to file issues either for bugs in the source code, feature requests, or issues with the Polymaps website. Support If you have questions or problems regarding Polymaps, you can get help by joining the #polymaps IRC channel on irc.freenode.net. You are also welcome to send GitHub messages or tweets to mbostock. Build Instructions You do not need to build Polymaps in order to view the examples; a compiled copy of Polymaps (polymaps.js and polymaps.min.js) is included in the repository. To edit and build a new version of Polymaps, you must first install Java and GNU Make. If you are on Mac OS X, you can install Make as part of the UNIX tools included with XCode. Once you've setup your development environment, you can rebuild Polymaps by running the following command from the repo's root directory: make  The Polymaps build process is exceptionally simple. First, all the JavaScript files are concatenated (using cat); the order of files is important to preserve dependencies. This produces the file polymaps.js. Second, this file is put through Google's Closure Compiler to minify the JavaScript, resulting in a smaller polymaps.min.js. If you are doing development, it is highly recommended that you use the non-minified JavaScript for easier debugging. The minified JavaScript is only intended for production, where file size matters. Note that the development version is marked as read-only so that you don't accidentally overwrite your edits after a re-build. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

The original author decided to move on with his life. Here are a few reasons why I stopped working on kartograph.js: there's no need to support non-SVG browsers anymore, so if I would touch kartograph.js again I would through out the Raphael.js dependency, which would result in a complete re-write which I don't want to spend my time on, because... D3.js is an amazing library that can do all the vector mapping that you need! Also d3.js has much more map projections and is more fun to work with. Finally, TopoJSON beats SVG as vector geo data format. So, thanks for the good time we had! Of course, if you still want to take over from here, kartograph.js is all yours. Just send me an email. Kartograph.js is a JavaScript library that renders SVG maps in web browsers. It is built on top of jQuery and RaphaelJS. Please have a look at the API docs for more details. Initializing a new map map = $K.map('#map', 600, 400); map.loadMap('world.svg', function() {     map.addLayer('countries', {         styles: {             fill: '#ee9900'         },         title: function(d) {             return d.countryName;         }     }); }); Choropleth maps (aka coloring map polygons based on data): pop_density = { 'USA': 123455, 'CAN': 232323, ... };  colorscale = new chroma.ColorScale({     colors: chroma.brewer.YlOrRd,     limits: chroma.limits(chroma.analyze(pop_density), 'k-means', 9) });  map.getLayer('countries').style('fill', function(data) {     return colorscale.get(pop_density[data.iso]); }); Adding symbols is easy, too: cities = [{ lat: 43, lon: -75, label: 'New York', population: 19465197 }];  map.addSymbols({     data: cities,     location: function(d) {         return [d.lon, d.lat];     },     type: Kartograph.Bubble,     radius: function(d) {         return Math.sqrt(d.population) * 0.001;     } }) Author Kartograph was created by Gregor Aisch.

It's built as a Leaflet plugin. You can read about its launch. API Managed as Markdown in API.md, following the standards in DOCUMENTING.md Examples Usage Recommended usage is via the Mapbox CDN, with code snippets available on the official documentation page The mapbox.js file includes the Leaflet library. Alternatively, you can use mapbox.standalone.js, which does not include Leaflet (you will have to provide it yourself). See the API documentation and Examples for further help. Usage with Browserify Install the mapbox.js module and add it to dependencies in package.json: npm install mapbox.js --save Require mapbox in your script: // main.js  require('mapbox.js'); // <-- auto-attaches to window.L Browserify it: browserify main.js -o bundle.js Usage with Bower You can install mapbox.js with bower by running bower install mapbox.js Usage as Download You can download a built release at the mapbox.js-bower repository. Building Requires node.js installed on your system. git clone https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox.js.git cd mapbox.js npm install make This project uses browserify to combine dependencies and installs a local copy when you run npm install. make will build the project in dist/. Tests Test with phantomjs: npm test To test in a browser, run a local development server and go to /test. Version v0.x.x Version v0.x.x can be accessed in the v0 branch.. Editing Icons Requirements: inkscape pngquant convert (part of imagemagick)  Make edits to theme/images/icons.svg. Run ./theme/images/render.sh to update sprites from your edits. Add a CSS reference with the appropriate pixel coordinate if adding a new icon. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Here is a sample HTML page for loading the World Map with default settings: <html>   <head>     <title>JQVMap - World Map</title>     <link href=""../dist/jqvmap.css"" media=""screen"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"">      <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js""></script>     <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""../dist/jquery.vmap.js""></script>     <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""../dist/maps/jquery.vmap.world.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>      <script type=""text/javascript"">     jQuery(document).ready(function() {       jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap({ map: 'world_en' });     });     </script>   </head>   <body>     <div id=""vmap"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;""></div>   </body> </html> Making it Pretty While initializing a map you can provide parameters to change its look and feel. jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap( {     map: 'world_en',     backgroundColor: '#a5bfdd',     borderColor: '#818181',     borderOpacity: 0.25,     borderWidth: 1,     color: '#f4f3f0',     enableZoom: true,     hoverColor: '#c9dfaf',     hoverOpacity: null,     normalizeFunction: 'linear',     scaleColors: ['#b6d6ff', '#005ace'],     selectedColor: '#c9dfaf',     selectedRegions: null,     showTooltip: true,     onRegionClick: function(element, code, region)     {         var message = 'You clicked ""'             + region             + '"" which has the code: '             + code.toUpperCase();          alert(message);     } }); More Examples You can see a variety of examples in the ./examples folder. Configuration Settings map 'world_en' Map you want to load. Must include the javascript file with the name of the map you want. Available maps with this library are world_en, usa_en, europe_en and germany_en backgroundColor '#a5bfdd' Background color of map container in any CSS compatible format. borderColor '#818181' Border Color to use to outline map objects borderOpacity 0.5 Border Opacity to use to outline map objects ( use anything from 0-1, e.g. 0.5, defaults to 0.25 ) borderWidth 3 Border Width to use to outline map objects ( defaults to 1 ) color '#f4f3f0' Color of map regions. colors Colors of individual map regions. Keys of the colors objects are country codes according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard. Keys of colors must be in lower case. enableZoom boolean Whether to Enable Map Zoom ( true or false, defaults to true) hoverColor '#c9dfaf' Color of the region when mouse pointer is over it. hoverColors Colors of individual map regions when mouse pointer is over it. Keys of the colors objects are country codes according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard. Keys of colors must be in lower case. hoverOpacity 0.5 Opacity of the region when mouse pointer is over it. normalizeFunction 'linear' This function can be used to improve results of visualizations for data with non-linear nature. Function gets raw value as the first parameter and should return value which will be used in calculations of color, with which particular region will be painted. scaleColors ['#b6d6ff', '#005ace'] This option defines colors, with which regions will be painted when you set option values. Array scaleColors can have more then two elements. Elements should be strings representing colors in RGB hex format. selectedColor '#333333' Color for a region when you select it selectedRegions ['MO', 'FL', 'OR'] This is the Region that you are looking to have preselected (two letter ISO code, defaults to null ). See REGIONS.md multiSelectRegion boolean Whether to enable more than one region to be selected at a time. showLabels boolean Whether to show ISO Code Labels ( true or false, defaults to false ) showTooltip boolean Whether to show Tooltips on Mouseover ( true or false, defaults to true ) onLoad function(event, map) Callback function which will be called when map is loading, returning the map event and map details. onLabelShow function(event, label, code) Callback function which will be called before label is shown. Label DOM object and country code will be passed to the callback as arguments. onRegionOver function(event, code, region) Callback function which will be called when the mouse cursor enters the region path. Country code will be passed to the callback as argument. onRegionOut function(event, code, region) Callback function which will be called when the mouse cursor leaves the region path. Country code will be passed to the callback as argument. onRegionClick function(event, code, region) Callback function which will be called when the user clicks the region path. Country code will be passed to the callback as argument. This callback may be called while the user is moving the map. If you need to distinguish between a ""real"" click and a click resulting from moving the map, you can inspect $(event.currentTarget).data('mapObject').isMoving. onRegionSelect function(event, code, region) Callback function which will be called when the selects a region. Country code will be passed to the callback as argument. onRegionDeselect function(event, code, region) Callback function which will be called when the deselects a region. Country code will be passed to the callback as argument. onResize function(event, width, height) Callback function which will be called when the map is resized. Return event, width & height. pins { ""pk"" : ""pk_pin_metadata"", ""ru"" : ""ru_pin_metadata"", ... } This option defines pins, which will be placed on the regions. The JSON can have only one element against one country code. Elements should be strings containing the HTML or id of the pin (depends on the 'pinMode' option explained next). pinMode content This option defines if the ""pins"" JSON contains the HTML strings of the pins or the ids of HTML DOM elements which are to be placed as pins. If the pin mode is ""content"" (or not specified) then the parameter ""pins"" contains the stringified html content to be placed as the pins. Example: jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap({     map: 'world_en',     pins: { ""pk"" : ""\u003cimg src=\""pk.png\"" /\u003e"" /*serialized <img src=""pk.png"" />*/, ... },     pinMode: 'content' }); If the pin mode is ""id"" then the parameter ""pins"" contains the value of ""id"" attribute of the html (DOM) elements to be placed as pins. Example: <script>   jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap({       map: 'world_en',       pins: { ""pk"" : ""pin_for_pk"", ""ru"" : ""pin_for_ru"", ... },       pinMode: 'id'   }); </script> <div style=""display:none"">   <img id=""pin_for_pk"" src=""pk.png"" />   <div id=""pin_for_ru"">...</div> </div> Note: 1) The pin is placed at the center of the rectangle bounding the country. So depending on the shape of the country, the pin might not land on the country itself. For instance, the pin for 'US' lands in the center of Alaska and rest of the US, which happens to be in the ocean between them. 2) If the ""pinMode"" is set to ""id"", then the html DOM elements having those ids are NOT COPIED to the desired position, they are TRANSFERRED. This means that the elements will be removed from their original positions and placed on the map. Dynamic Updating Most of the options can be changed after initialization using the following code: jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap('set', 'colors', {us: '#0000ff'}); Instead of colors can be used any parameter except callbacks. Callbacks can be added and deleted using standard jQuery patterns of working with events. You can define callback function when you initialize JQVMap: jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap( {     onLoad: function(event, map)     {      },     onLabelShow: function(event, label, code)     {      },     onRegionOver: function(event, code, region)     {      },     onRegionOut: function(event, code, region)     {      },     onRegionClick: function(event, code, region)     {      },     onResize: function(event, width, height)     {      } }); Or later using standard jQuery mechanism: jQuery('#vmap').bind('load.jqvmap',     function(event, map)     {      } ); jQuery('#vmap').bind('labelShow.jqvmap',     function(event, label, code)     {      } ); jQuery('#vmap').bind('regionMouseOver.jqvmap',     function(event, code, region)     {      } ); jQuery('#vmap').bind('regionMouseOut.jqvmap',     function(event, code, region)     {      } ); jQuery('#vmap').bind('regionClick.jqvmap',     function(event, code, region)     {      } ); jQuery('#vmap').bind('resize.jqvmap',     function(event, width, height)     {      } ); Consider that fact that you can use standard features of jQuery events like event.preventDefault() or returning false from the callback to prevent default behavior of JQVMap (showing label or changing country color on hover). In the following example, when user moves mouse cursor over Canada label won't be shown and color of country won't be changed. At the same label for Russia will have custom text. jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap( {     onLabelShow: function(event, label, code)     {         if (code == 'ca')         {             // Hide the label             event.preventDefault();         }         else if (code == 'ru')         {             // Plain TEXT labels             label.text('Bears, vodka, balalaika');         }         else if (code == 'us')         {             // HTML Based Labels. You can use any HTML you want, this is just an example             label.html('<div class=""map-tooltip""><h1 class=""header"">Header</h1><p class=""description"">Some Description</p></div>');         }     },     onRegionOver: function(event, code)     {         if (code == 'ca')         {             event.preventDefault();         }     }, }); Data Visualization Here I want to demonstrate how visualization of some geographical-related data can be done using JQVMap. Let's visualize information about GDP in 2010 for every country. At first we need some data. Let it be site of International Monetary Fond. There we can get information in xsl format, which can be converted first to csv and then to json with any scripting language. Now we have file gdp-data.js with such content (globals are evil, I know, but just for the sake of simplification): var gdpData = {""af"":16.63,""al"":11.58,""dz"":158.97,...}; Then connect it to the page and add some code to make visualization: var max = 0,     min = Number.MAX_VALUE,     cc,     startColor = [200, 238, 255],     endColor = [0, 100, 145],     colors = {},     hex;  //find maximum and minimum values for (cc in gdpData) {     if (parseFloat(gdpData[cc]) > max)     {         max = parseFloat(gdpData[cc]);     }     if (parseFloat(gdpData[cc]) < min)     {         min = parseFloat(gdpData[cc]);     } }  //set colors according to values of GDP for (cc in gdpData) {     if (gdpData[cc] > 0)     {         colors[cc] = '#';         for (var i = 0; i<3; i++)         {             hex = Math.round(startColor[i]                 + (endColor[i]                 - startColor[i])                 * (gdpData[cc] / (max - min))).toString(16);              if (hex.length == 1)             {                 hex = '0'+hex;             }              colors[cc] += (hex.length == 1 ? '0' : '') + hex;         }     } }  //initialize JQVMap jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap( {     colors: colors,     hoverOpacity: 0.7,     hoverColor: false }); Functions There are seven functions that can be called on map container: zoomIn() Zoom one step in Usage: jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap('zoomIn'); zoomOut() Zoom one step out Usage: jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap('zoomOut'); getPinId(cc) Returns the html attribute ""id"" of the pin placed on the country whose country code is provided in ""cc"". Usage: var pinId = jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap('getPinId', 'pk'); getPin(cc) Returns stringified HTML of the pin placed on the country whose country code is provided in ""cc"". Usage: var pinContent = jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap('getPin', 'pk'); getPins() Returns an associative JSON string containing stringified HTML of all the pins. Usage: var pins = jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap('getPins'); removePin(cc) Removes the pin from the country whose country code is specified in ""cc"". Usage: jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap('removePin', 'pk'); removePins() Removes all the pins from the map. Usage: jQuery('#vmap').vectorMap('removePins'); Events There are three events which you can use to bind your own callbacks to: drag When the map is dragged, this event is triggered. zoomIn When the map is zoomed in, this event is triggered. zoomOut When the map is zoomed out, this event is triggered. You can bind your routines to any of these events by using jQuery on() For example: //Do something when the map is dragged jQuery('#vmap').on('drag', function(event) {     console.log('The map is being dragged');     //Do something }); Custom Maps So you want to create your own maps, or change some existing ones. Awesome. Make sure to check out ./create/README.md for details on how to do this. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

PrettyEmbed.js on GitHub PrettyEmbed.js Demo on CodePen Features Choose from one of eight thumbnail sizes Implement programmatically or via HTML5 data- attributes Getting Started Requirements jQuery waitForImages There are two methods of implementing PrettyEmbed.js - an HTML5 driven method, and a script driven method. Include jQuery Include waitForImages On the document.ready() event, call the plugin HTML5 Driven Application Form embeds by attaching the class of .pretty-embed, as well as any other required data-pe- options. <div class=""pretty-embed"" data-pe-videoid=""aBcDeFg12345"" data-pe-fitvids=""true""></div>  Call the plugin $().prettyEmbed({ useFitVids: true });  Script Driven Create an HTML placeholder, such as this: <div id=""my-video-display""></div>  Call the plugin on the placeholder element: $('#my-video-display').prettyEmbed({     videoID: 'aBcDeFg12345',     previewSize: 'hd',              // use either this option...     customPreviewImage: '',         // ...or this option      // Embed controls     showInfo: false,     showControls: true,     loop: false,      colorScheme: 'dark',     showRelated: false,      useFitVids: true });  Note that html5 data-pe- attributes will take precedence over the options called programmatically. E.g. data-pe-videoid=""aBcDeFg1234"" takes precedence over options.videoID: '1234GfEdCbA'. Also Note that if a particular preview image size is loading a generic gray ""three dots"" image, YouTube might not have generated a thumbnail in this size. Try a different size. Options Name Description videoID The video ID of the YouTube video. This option will be ignored if the data-videoid attribute is present. (E.g.: aBcDeFg12345) previewSize Preview image size pulled from YouTube. This option will be ignored if the customPreviewImage attribute is present. Available sizes from smallest to largest: thumb-default, thumb-1, thumb-2, thumb-3, default, medium, high, hd (default) customPreviewImage Custom defined preview image URL. This option overrides options.previewSize. showInfo Display video information (top bar). showControls Display YouTube player controls. loop Play video as a loop. closedCaptions Displays closed captions (if available). localization Changes the localization. Accepts an ISO 639-1 two-letter language code. colorScheme Display YouTube player user interface. showRelated Display YouTube related videos on video end. allowFullScreen Defaults to true, can be set to false to disable the viewer from viewing in fullscreen mode. useFitVids Call FitVids.js on .pretty-embed instances once the video(s) is/are loaded. Changelog v1.2.1 Fixed mobile player bug New option: allowFullScreen which can be used to turn off fullscreen viewing mode v1.2.0 Fixed those annoying ""black bars"" that would show up on the sides of the video once playing Fixed an issue which would cause HTML5 data-pe- attributes to break Removed the background-color from .pretty-embed, because be more flexible, ya know? New option: closedCaptions to turn on closed captions (if available) New option: localization which accepts an ISO 639-1 two-letter language code v1.1.0 Better multiple instance handling Fixed duplicate appended styles on multiple instances Better handling of mobile - this means that placeholders are not custom on mobile since YouTube does not allow for autoplay=1 on mobile devices (boooo) Added option to choose preview image size pulled from YouTube Removed use of deprecated .selector property, which allowed for further minification and a cleaner application of the embedded CSS Fixed ugly default border on YouTube embeds Improved documentation v1.0.0 Initial Release Thanks Thanks to the contributors and suggestions from around the web. Thanks to alexanderdickson for waitForImages, which this plugin leverages for dynamic image previews.

How to enable video and audio tags in all major browsers To make HTML5 video and audio tags work in all major browsers, simply add the following line of code somewhere in the <head> of your document. <script src=""http://api.html5media.info/1.1.8/html5media.min.js""></script> That's it! There is no second step! How to embed video You can embed video into your page using the following code. <video src=""video.mp4"" width=""320"" height=""200"" controls preload></video> For more information and troubleshooting, please visit the video wiki page. How to embed audio You can embed audio into your page using the following code. <audio src=""audio.mp3"" controls preload></audio> For more information and troubleshooting, please visit the audio wiki page. Why use html5media? HTML5 video and audio tags were designed to make embedding a video as easy as embedding an image. They were also designed to give users a faster experience by doing away with browser plugins such as Adobe Flash. Unfortunately, older browsers don't support HTML5 video and audio tags, and even modern browsers don't support a consistent set of video codecs, making embedding a video rather difficult. The html5media project makes embedding video or audio as easy as it was meant to be. It's a fire-and-forget solution, and doesn't require installing any files on your server. Unlike many other HTML5 video players, it allows people to use the video controls supplied by their own web browser. It's one of the smallest, fastest solutions available, and as browser technology improves it will become even faster. More information The html5media project is open source and can be found on GitHub. You can find out more information on the html5media wiki, or the main html5media project page. About the author Dave Hall is a freelance web developer, based in Cambridge, UK. You can usually find him on the Internet in a number of different places: Website Blog Twitter Google Profile Extra credits The html5media project bundles together a number of excellent open-source and creative-commons projects.

PlayemJS powers the music curation service Whyd.com. That's the best demonstration of its capabilities. Usage example The following lines of HTML and Javascript create a container and play two videos in it, sequentially. <div id=""container""></div> <script> new PlayemLoader().loadAllPlayers().whenReady(function(playem){   playem.addTrackByUrl(""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuhHU_BZXSk"");   playem.addTrackByUrl(""https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x25ohb"");   playem.play(); }); </script> Demos Playing a Vimeo video Playing video from a combined file Playing two videos in sequence Playing two Youtube videos in sequence Usage with npm & browserify npm install playemjs  Then use it that way in your front-end code: <html> <body>   <div id=""container""></div>   <script src=""your-browserify-bundle.js""></script>   <script>     // your app's API KEYS here     window.SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_ID = ""11f9999111b5555c22227777c3333fed""; // your api key     window.DEEZER_APP_ID = 123456789;     window.DEEZER_CHANNEL_URL = ""http://mysite.com/deezer-channel.html"";     window.JAMENDO_CLIENT_ID = ""f9ff9f0f"";      var playerParams = {       playerId: ""genericplayer"",       origin: window.location.host || window.location.hostname,       playerContainer: document.getElementById(""container"")     };      window.makePlayem(null, playerParams, function onLoaded(playem){       playem.on(""onTrackChange"", function(track){         console.log(""streaming track "" + track.trackId + "" from "" + track.playerName);       });       playem.addTrackByUrl(""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuhHU_BZXSk"");       playem.addTrackByUrl(""https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x25ohb"");       playem.play();     });   </script> </body> </html> Install using Bower bower install playemjs make install make compile make tests  ... or download the javascript files (playem.js and player files you need) into your public directory of your web project.

It's located under the PP namespace inside window (PP.Player). new Player(options) Creates a new player instance. options in an object: videoUrl String: Video URL, e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKW5iugJChk, https://soundcloud.com/mashupgermany/mashup-germany-berlin-banquet, http://vimeo.com/18890266 container String: CSS selector string to match the parent element Player#play() Plays the video. This will fire a play event and change the state to PLAYING. Player#pause() Pauses the video. This will fire a pause event and change the state to PAUSED. Player#stop() Stops the video. This will fire a stop event and change the state to STOPPED. The video will start from the beginning when played. Player#getDetails(callback) Fetches details about the video. callback is a node-like callback function (err, result). result is an object containing following properties: title String: The video's title duration Number: Duration in ms createdAt Date: Video's creating date thumbnails Array: Video's thumbnail. Each element has width, height and url properties Player#getCurrentPosition() Returns the current position in ms. Player#getState() Returns the current state: Player.states.LOADING: 0 Player.states.READY: 1 Player.states.PLAYING: 2 Player.states.PAUSED: 3 Player.states.FINISHED: 4 Player.states.STOPPED: 5 Player#seek(percent) Seeks to a relative position in the video. percent is a number between 0 and 1, e.g. 0.5. This will fire a playProgress event. Player#seekTo(ms) Seeks to a absolute position in the video. ms is the number in ms to seek to, e.g. 12000. This will fire a playProgress event. Events Use Backbone.Model's on, off and once function to listen to events. play Fired when the video starts to play. pause Fired when the video pauses. stop Fired when the video stops. finish Fired when the video finishs to play. playProgress Fired continously when the video plays or seeks. stateChange Fired when the states changes. See Player#getState(). Playlist Playlist is an instace of Backbone.Collection and has all its functions inherited. It's located under the PP namespace inside window (PP.Playlist). new Player(players, options) players is an array which contains Players which should be add instantly. Creates a new player instance. options in an object: container String: CSS selector string to match the parent element in which later added players are injected. Playlist#add(player) Add a player to the list. player is either an instance of Player or an options object which will be passed to the Player's contructor. Playlist#getCurrentPlayer() Returns the current player object or null. Playlist#setPlayer(playerObj) playerObj should be an instance on Player which will be set as the current player. Playlist#setPlayerById(playerId) Same as setPlayer but gets the player using its id. Playlist#nextPlayer(startFromBeginning) Set the next player in the list as the current one. If startFromBeginning is true it will start from the beginning again if it reaches the bottom. Playlist#previousPlayer(startFromEnd) Sets the previous player in the list as the current one. If startFromEnd is true it will start from the end again it it reaches the top. Playlist#randomPlayer() Sets a random player as the current player. Playlist#loopMode Represents the current strategy what happends when a player finishes (finish event is fired): Playlist.loopModes.NO: 0 (Nothing, default) Playlist.loopModes.NEXT: 1 (Play the next player but don't repeat the list) Playlist.loopModes.LOOP: 2 (Play the next player and repeat the list) Playlist.loopModes.RANDOM: 3 (Choose a random player to be next) It also exposes following functions which behave the same as Player does on the current player: Playlist#play() Playlist#pause() Playlist#stop() Playlist#getCurrentPosition() Playlist#getState() Playlist#seek(percent) Events Since it's a Backbone.Collection, Playlist triggers all events which are emitted by its models (see Player's event). Additionally it fires a playerChange event when a new player is set. Browser support Tested successfully in Chrome 31 and Firefox 26. IE 11 has problems using the YouTube iFrame API (we cannot fix this; it's YT's problem). Mobile browsers need flash or support HTML5's video and audio elements. Testing Use test/player.html and test/playlist.html to run tests. You'll need Flash in order to succed all tests.

Many great HTML5 players have a completely separate Flash UI in fallback mode, but MediaElementPlayer.js uses the same HTML/CSS for all players. Change Log Changes available at Change Log 1. Add Script and Stylesheet <script src=""jquery.js""></script> <script src=""mediaelement-and-player.min.js""></script> <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""mediaelementplayer.css"" /> 2. Add <video> or <audio> tags If your users have JavaScript and/or Flash, the easiest route for all browsers and mobile devices is to use a single MP4 or MP3 file. <video src=""myvideo.mp4"" width=""320"" height=""240""></video> <audio src=""myaudio.mp3""></audio> Optional: multiple codecs This includes multiple codecs for various browsers (H.264 for IE9+, Safari, and Chrome, WebM for Firefox 4 and Opera, Ogg for Firefox 3). <video width=""320"" height=""240"" poster=""poster.jpg"" controls=""controls"" preload=""none"">     <source type=""video/mp4"" src=""myvideo.mp4"" />     <source type=""video/webm"" src=""myvideo.webm"" />     <source type=""video/ogg"" src=""myvideo.ogv"" /> </video> Optional: Browsers with JavaScript disabled In very rare cases, you might have a non-HTML5 browser with Flash turned on and JavaScript turned off. In that specific case, you can also include the Flash <object> code. <video width=""320"" height=""240"" poster=""poster.jpg"" controls=""controls"" preload=""none"">     <source type=""video/mp4"" src=""myvideo.mp4"" />     <source type=""video/webm"" src=""myvideo.webm"" />     <source type=""video/ogg"" src=""myvideo.ogv"" />     <object width=""320"" height=""240"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" data=""flashmediaelement.swf"">         <param name=""movie"" value=""flashmediaelement.swf"" />          <param name=""flashvars"" value=""controls=true&amp;poster=myvideo.jpg&amp;file=myvideo.mp4"" />                 <img src=""myvideo.jpg"" width=""320"" height=""240"" title=""No video playback capabilities"" />     </object> </video> 3. Startup Automatic start You can avoid running any startup scripts by added class=""mejs-player"" to the <video> or <audio> tag. Options can be added using the data-mejsoptions attribute <video src=""myvideo.mp4"" width=""320"" height=""240""          class=""mejs-player""          data-mejsoptions='{""alwaysShowControls"": true}'></video> Normal JavaScript <script> var player = new MediaElementPlayer('#player', {success: function(mediaElement, originalNode) {     // do things }}); </script>   jQuery plugin <script> $('video').mediaelementplayer({success: function(mediaElement, originalNode) {     // do things }}); </script> How it Works: MediaElement.js: HTML5 <video> and <audio> shim MediaElement.js is a set of custom Flash and Silverlight plugins that mimic the HTML5 MediaElement API for browsers that don't support HTML5 or don't support the media codecs you're using. Instead of using Flash as a fallback, Flash is used to make the browser seem HTML5 compliant and enable codecs like H.264 (via Flash) and even WMV (via Silverlight) on all browsers. <script src=""mediaelement.js""></script> <video src=""myvideo.mp4"" width=""320"" height=""240""></video>  <script> var v = document.getElementsByTagName(""video"")[0]; new MediaElement(v, {success: function(media) {     media.play(); }}); </script> You can use this as a standalone library if you wish, or just stick with the full MediaElementPlayer. Building MediaElement.js When developing MediaElement, make changes to the files in the /src/ directory (not /build/) and test the changes with /test/test.html. To compile the changes Install node.js with npm https://nodejs.org/ At the command prompt type npm install which will download all the necessary tools Type grunt to build MediaElement.js To compile the Flash swf, you'll need to install Flex 4.6. See instructions in Gruntfile.js for details. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc. Terms Privacy Security Status Help Something went wrong with that request.

Nov 20, 2015 icon.png Updated documentation + icon Dec 17, 2014 README.md SoundJS SoundJS is a library to make working with audio on the web easier. It provides a consistent API for playing audio in different browsers, including using a target plugin model to provide an easy way to provide additional audio plugins like a Flash fallback. A mechanism has been provided for easily tying in audio preloading to PreloadJS. Example createjs.Sound.on(""fileload"", handleLoadComplete); createjs.Sound.alternateExtensions = [""mp3""]; createjs.Sound.registerSound({src:""path/to/sound.ogg"", id:""sound""}); function handleLoadComplete(event) {     createjs.Sound.play(""sound""); } License Built by gskinner.com, and released for free under the MIT license, which means you can use it for almost any purpose (including commercial projects). We appreciate credit where possible, but it is not a requirement. Support and Resources Find examples and more information at the SoundJS web site Read the documentation Discuss, share projects, and interact with other users on reddit. Ask technical questions on Stack Overflow. File verified bugs or formal feature requests using Issues on GitHub. Have a look at the included examples and API documentation for more in-depth information. Classes Sound The core API for playing sounds. Call createjs.Sound.play(sound, ...options), and a sound instance is created that can be used to control the audio, and dispatches events when it is complete, loops, or is interrupted. SoundInstance A controllable sound object that wraps the actual plugin implementation, providing a consistent API for audio playback, no matter what happens in the background. Sound instances can be paused, muted, and stopped; and the volume, pan (where available), and position changed using the simple API. WebAudioPlugin The default, built-in plugin, which uses Web Audio APIs to playback sounds. Note that WebAudio will fail to load when run locally, and the HTML audio plugin will be used instead. HTMLAudioPlugin The fallback built-in plugin, which manages audio playback via the HTML5 tag. This will be used in instances where the WebAudio plugin is not available. CordovaAudioPlugin An additional plugin which will playback audio in a Cordova app and tools that utilize Cordova such as PhoneGap or Ionic. You must manually register this plugin. Currently available on github since SoundJS-0.6.1. FlashAudioPlugin An additional plugin which uses a flash shim (and SWFObject) to playback audio using Flash. You must manually set up and register this plugin. Documentation and examples Have a look at the included examples and API documentation for more in-depth information.

It supports HTML5 and Flash video, as well as YouTube and Vimeo (through plugins). It supports video playback on desktops and mobile devices. This project was started mid 2010, and the player is now used on over 50,000 100,000 200,000 websites. Quick start Thanks to the awesome folks over at Fastly, there's a free, CDN hosted version of Video.js that anyone can use. Also, check out the Getting Started page on our website which has the latest urls as well. Simply add these includes to your document's <head>: <link href=""//vjs.zencdn.net/5.8/video-js.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet""> <script src=""//vjs.zencdn.net/5.8/video.min.js""></script> Then, whenever you want to use Video.js you can simply use the <video> element as your normally would, but with an additional data-setup attribute containing any Video.js options. These options can include any Video.js option plus potential plugin options, just make sure they're valid JSON! <video id=""really-cool-video"" class=""video-js vjs-default-skin"" controls  preload=""auto"" width=""640"" height=""264"" poster=""really-cool-video-poster.jpg""  data-setup='{}'>   <source src=""really-cool-video.mp4"" type=""video/mp4"">   <source src=""really-cool-video.webm"" type=""video/webm"">   <p class=""vjs-no-js"">     To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser     that <a href=""http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/"" target=""_blank"">supports HTML5 video</a>   </p> </video> If you don't want to use auto-setup, you can leave off the data-setup attribute and initialize a video element manually. var player = videojs('really-cool-video', { /* Options */ }, function() {   console.log('Good to go!');    this.play(); // if you don't trust autoplay for some reason    // How about an event listener?   this.on('ended', function() {     console.log('awww...over so soon?');   }); }); If you're ready to dive in, the documentation is the first place to go for more information.

Feb 15, 2016 tests.html Fix indentation in tests.html Oct 13, 2014 README.md Introducing FitVids.js A lightweight, easy-to-use jQuery plugin for fluid width video embeds. FitVids automates the Intrinsic Ratio Method by Thierry Koblentz to achieve fluid width videos in your responsive web design. How Do I Use It? Include jQuery 1.7+ and FitVids.js in your layout and target your videos container with fitVids(). <script src=""path/to/jquery.min.js""></script> <script src=""path/to/jquery.fitvids.js""></script> <script>   $(document).ready(function(){     // Target your .container, .wrapper, .post, etc.     $(""#thing-with-videos"").fitVids();   }); </script> This will wrap each video in a div.fluid-width-video-wrapper and apply the necessary CSS. After the initial Javascript call, it's all percentage-based CSS magic. Currently Supported Players YouTube Y Vimeo Y Blip.tv Y* Viddler Y* Kickstarter Y* * means native support for these may be deprecated. If your video platform is not currently supported, try adding it via a customSelector... Add Your Own Video Vendor Have a custom video player? We now have a customSelector option where you can add your own specific video vendor selector (mileage may vary depending on vendor and fluidity of player):   $(""#thing-with-videos"").fitVids({ customSelector: ""iframe[src^='http://mycoolvideosite.com'], iframe[src^='http://myviiids.com']""});   // Selectors are comma separated, just like CSS Note: This will be the quickest way to add your own custom vendor as well as test your player's compatibility with FitVids. Ignore With Class Have a video you want FitVids to ignore? You can slap a class of fitvidsignore on your object or container and your video will be displayed as it is defined. If you'd like to add a custom block to ignore FitVids, use the ignore option.   $(""#thing-with-videos"").fitVids({ ignore: '.mycooldiv, #myviiid'});   // Selectors are comma separated, just like CSS Known issues Vimeo Autoplay API is not compatible with FitVids in IE11. You must manually wrap videos you want to autoplay. Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc. Terms Privacy Security Status Help Something went wrong with that request.

Version: 3.0.7 Project page and demos Download ZIP Description Ion.Sound — JavaScript-plugin for playing sounds based on Web Audio API. Plugin is working on most popular desktop and mobile browsers and can be used everywhere, from common web sites to browser games. For not so modern browsers plugin falls back to HTML5 audio. Audio-sprites support included. Ion.Sound freely distributed under terms of MIT licence. 25 free sounds included Today websites are full of events (new mail, new chat-message, content update etc.). Often it is not enough to indicate this events only visually to get user attention. You need sounds! This library, made for playing small sounds, will help you with this task. Also, new version of Ion.Sound is capable to handle browser games audio. It has full control of loading, playing and removing audio files. And audio-sprites support of course. Supported browsers Desktop Windows, OS X, Linux: Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Internet Explorer 9.0+ Opera 12.16+ Safari 5.1+ (Safari on Windows requires QuickTime to play sounds) Mobile: iOS Safari and others (with some restrictions) Android Google Chrome and others (with some restrictions also) WP8 Internet Explorer Can i use Web Audio API and HTML5 Audio? Demos Basic demo Advanced demo Dependencies None Usage Import this library: ion.sound.min.js Prepare sound-files (25 sounds are included) and put them in some folder (eg. ""sounds""): my_cool_sound.mp3 my_cool_sound.ogg my_cool_sound.aac It is not enough to have only MP3-file, you should make OGG and AAC-file too, because not all browsers support MP3. You can easily convert you MP3-s to OGG-s and AAC-s at Media.io or at CloudConvert.org. AAC support was added to improve cross browser support of iOS 8.x devices (iPhone, iPad) Install with bower bower install ionsound Install with npm npm install ion-sound Install with spm spm install ion-sound Initialisation To initialise plugin call this method: ion.sound({     sounds: [         {             name: ""my_cool_sound""         },         {             name: ""notify_sound"",             volume: 0.2         },         {             name: ""alert_sound"",             volume: 0.3,             preload: false         }     ],     volume: 0.5,     path: ""sounds/"",     preload: true }); And play sound! // Simple ion.sound.play(""my_cool_sound""); General settings Option Defaults Type Description sounds - array Collection of sound objects. Each object contains information about sound file and (optional) individual settings path - string Path to file preload false boolean Preloading sounds multiplay false boolean Sound multi play. If set, will allow to play multiple instances of one sound at once loop false boolean/number If set to true will enable infinite loop. Or paste a number to set loop limit volume 1.0 number Playback volume from 0 to 1 scope null object Callbacks will be called in that object's scope ready_callback null function Called after sound file is fully uploaded (or ready to play for HTML5 audio) ended_callback null function Called each time then sound file will reach it's end Sound object Option Defaults Type Description name - string File name. Plugin will choose file extension automatically (.mp3, .ogg, .aac, .mp4 and etc.) alias - string Alias for sound call, optional. Normally is used to shorten ion.sound calls sprite - object Mark that sound is audio-sprite. This is an object. Example: {""part_name_1"": [0, 2], ""part_name_2"": [2, 2]} Part_name is a name of sprite piece (it is used instead of name to play a sound). And array with time marks: [start, duration] in seconds. And also individual: path, preload, multiplay, loop, volume, scope and callbacks Plugin can be launched in jQuery namespace Use aliases to call any plugin methods: ion.sound(); -> $.ionSound(); ion.sound.play(""sound_name""); -> $.ionSound.play(""sound_name""); Etc.

Check out the demo site. What does FlowType.JS do? Ideally, the most legible typography contains between 45 and 75 characters per line. This is difficult to accomplish for all screen widths with only CSS media-queries. FlowType.JS eases this difficulty by changing the font-size and line-height based on a specific element's width. This allows for a perfect character count per line at any screen width. Options Thresholds Set minimum and maximum width thresholds to control the FlowType.JS magic within specific element widths. In this example, FlowType.JS will stop resizing text once the element width becomes smaller than 500px or larger than 1200px. $('body').flowtype({    minimum : 500,    maximum : 1200 }); Set minimum and maximum font-size thresholds to control the FlowType.JS magic within specific font sizes. In this example, FlowType.JS will stop resizing text once the font-size becomes smaller than 12px or larger than 40px. $('body').flowtype({    minFont : 12,    maxFont : 40 }); Font-size Set your own font-size using the fontRatio variable. When using fontRatio, increase the value to make the font smaller (and vice versa). Note: Because each font is different, you will need to ""tweak"" fontSize and ""eye ball"" your final product to make sure that your character count is within the recommended range. Line-height (lineRatio) is set based on the fontRatio size, and defaults to 1.45 (the recommended line-height for maximum legibility). See line-height below. $('body').flowtype({    fontRatio : 30 }); Line-height In v1.0 of FlowType, we made the plugin set a specific line-height in pixels. We received many statements that setting a specific line-height is very dangerous. So, what did we do? We removed support for line-height in v1.1. What do I do now? It's quite simple: use unitless line-height in your CSS. It will automatically make changes based on the font size. Here's an example of what we suggest for line-height: line-height: 1.45; Getting Started Step 1: Install FlowType.JS To use FlowType, you'll need to make sure both the jQuery and FlowType.JS scripts are included. Download FlowType.JS Download the latest release. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/simplefocus/FlowType.JS.git. Install with Bower: bower install Flowtype.js. Include jQuery and FlowType.JS scripts <script src=""//code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js""></script> <script src=""flowtype.js""></script> Step 2: Set Typography Base Prepare for FlowType.JS by making sure that the typography is flexible. Start with this CSS and make changes as necessary: body {    font-size: 18px; }  h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,p {    line-height: 1.45; }  h1 { font-size: 4em; } h2 { font-size: 3em; } h3 { etc... Note: Setting a specific font-size in your CSS file will make sure that your website remains accessible in case your viewer has JavaScript disabled. These numbers will be overridden as FlowType.JS updates the font-size number inline. Step 3: Call FlowType.JS To begin the magic, simply call FlowType.JS before the close of your body tag: $('body').flowtype(); Step 4: Make Changes You will most likely want to change the default settings. To do so, simply include these options in your code and tweak away: $('body').flowtype({    minimum   : 500,    maximum   : 1200,    minFont   : 12,    maxFont   : 40,    fontRatio : 30 }); Brought to you by...

In order to best serve sizes to all browsers, BigText will adjust word-spacing as well as font-size. Examples Simple Example <div id=""bigtext"">     <span>BIGTEXT</span>     <span>Makes Text Big</span> </div> <script> $('#bigtext').bigtext(); </script>  Better, Progressive Enhancement-Based Example Use display: inline children (like a span) so the text will flow correctly if BigText doesn’t run. <div id=""bigtext"">     <span>BIGTEXT</span>     <span>Makes Text Big</span> </div> <script> // Only BigText on “new-ish” browsers if( 'querySelectorAll' in document ) {     $('#bigtext').bigtext();     } </script>  Using a List (ordered/unordered) <ol id=""bigtext"">     <li>BIGTEXT</li>     <li>Makes Text Big</li> </ol> <script> $('#bigtext').bigtext(); </script>  Restrict to a subset of children Opt-in children with JS <div id=""bigtext"">     <p>BIGTEXT</p>     <p>Makes Text Big</p> </div> <script> $('#bigtext').bigtext({     childSelector: '> p' }); </script>  Opt-out lines using markup <ol id=""bigtext"">     <li>BIGTEXT</li>     <li class=""bigtext-exempt"">Makes Text Big</li> </ol> <script> $('#bigtext').bigtext(); </script>  Mix and Match Fonts <ol id=""bigtext"">     <li>         <span style=""font-family: sans-serif"">BIG</span>         <span style=""font-family: serif"">TEXT</span>     </li>     <li>Makes Text Big</li> </ol> <script> $('#bigtext').bigtext(); </script>  Works also with letter-spacing, word-spacing, and text-transform. Using with Custom Font-Face Warning: a known issue exists with the Google/TypeKit font loader in WebKit. <div id=""bigtext"">     <span>BIGTEXT</span>     <span>Makes Text Big</span> </div> <script src=""//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1/webfont.js""></script> <script> $(function() {     WebFont.load({         custom: {             families: ['LeagueGothicRegular'], // font-family name             urls : ['css/fonts/league-gothic/stylesheet.css'] // URL to css         },         active: function() {             $('#bigtext').bigtext();         }     }); }); </script>  Change the default max font size <div id=""bigtext"">     <span>BIG</span><!-- the shorter the line, the larger the size required -->  </div> <script> $('#bigtext').bigtext({     maxfontsize: 60 // default is 528 (in px) }); </script>  Adding a default min font size <div id=""bigtext"">     <span>This is a super long line that will probably be resized to epically small proportions. We need a minimum font size!</span> </div> <script> $('#bigtext').bigtext({     minfontsize: 16 // default is null }); </script>  Is your text static and unchanging? See Paravel's FitText plugin. Curious how the two plugins compare? I've written a full comparison between FitText and BigText. Extra Features Re-BigText on Resize (Responsive BigText) As of 0.1.8, BigText implements its own debounced resize event. Debug Mode BigText uses an off-canvas detached node to improve performance when sizing. Setting DEBUG_MODE to true will leave this detached node on the canvas for visual inspection for problem resolution. BigText.DEBUG_MODE = true;  Common Problems Lines Wrapping Pre-BigText The starting font-size must be small enough to guarantee that each individual line is not wrapping pre-BigText. If the line is too long, BigText will not size it correctly. Releases v0.1.0 Initial release v0.1.1 Added line exempt feature. v0.1.2 Responsive BigText resizes with media queries and resize events (optionally debounced). v0.1.3 v0.1.4 on 2013-08-24 Numerous bug fixes, improved accuracy, adds debug mode. v0.1.5 on 2013-10-14 BigText uses all children by default (#40) v0.1.6 Various bug fixes. Using the repo Run these commands: npm install bower install grunt Configuring Grunt Rather than one giant Gruntfile.js, this project is using a modular Grunt setup. Each individual grunt configuration option key has its own file located in grunt/config-lib/ (readonly upstream configs, do not modify these directly) or grunt/config/ (project specific configs). You may use the same key in both directories, the objects are smartly combined using Lo-Dash merge. For concatenation in the previous Gruntfile setup, you’d add another key to the giant object passed into grunt.initConfig like this: grunt.initConfig({ concat: { /* YOUR CONFIG */ } });. In the new configuration, you’ll create a grunt/config/concat.js with module.exports = { /* YOUR CONFIG */ };. License MIT License Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Use this plugin on your responsive design for ratio-based resizing of your headlines. How it works Here is a simple FitText setup: <script src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js""></script> <script src=""jquery.fittext.js""></script> <script>   jQuery(""#responsive_headline"").fitText(); </script> Your text should now fluidly resize, by default: Font-size = 1/10th of the element's width. The Compressor If your text is resizing poorly, you'll want to turn tweak up/down ""The Compressor"". It works a little like a guitar amp. The default is 1. jQuery(""#responsive_headline"").fitText(1.2); // Turn the compressor up   (resizes more aggressively) jQuery(""#responsive_headline"").fitText(0.8); // Turn the compressor down (resizes less aggressively) This will hopefully give you a level of ""control"" that might not be pixel perfect, but resizes smoothly & nicely. minFontSize & maxFontSize FitText now allows you to specify two optional pixel values: minFontSize and maxFontSize. Great for situations when you want to preserve hierarchy. jQuery(""#responsive_headline"").fitText(1.2, { minFontSize: '20px', maxFontSize: '40px' }); CSS FAQ ⚠️ Run FitText before anything that hides the element you're trying to size (e.g. before Carousels, Scrollers, Accordions, Tabs, etc). Hiding an element's container removes its width. It can't resize without a width. ⚠️ Make sure your container has a width! display: inline elements don't have a width. Use display: block OR display: inline-block+ a specified width (i.e. width: 100%). position:absolute elements need a specified width as well. Tweak until you like it. Set a No-JS fallback font-size in your CSS. 🆕 If your text is full width, you might want to NOT use FitText and just use CSS vw units instead. Supported in all major browsers. Don't use jQuery? That's okay. Check out these handy non-jQuery versions maintained by other people. non-jQuery FitText from @adactio Angular.js FitText.js from @patrickmarabeas AMP-HTML FitText FitText UMD by @peacechen Changelog v 1.2 - Added onorientationchange event v 1.1 - FitText now ignores font-size and has minFontSize & maxFontSize options v 1.0.1 - Fix for broken font-size. v 1.0 - Initial Release In Use: Trent Walton If you want more exact fitting text, there are plugins for that!

Let me demo it for you: </stevejobs> Individual Letter Control with Lettering.js We'll start with some really basic markup: <h1 class=""fancy_title"">Some Title</h1> After including jQuery 1.6.2+, download and include the minified version of Lettering.js, then a script block with the magical .lettering() method: <script>       $(document).ready(function() {         $("".fancy_title"").lettering();       }); </script> The resulting code will churn your .fancy_title and output the following: <h1 class=""fancy_title"">   <span class=""char1"">S</span>   <span class=""char2"">o</span>   <span class=""char3"">m</span>   <span class=""char4"">e</span>   <span class=""char5""></span>   <span class=""char6"">T</span>   <span class=""char7"">i</span>   <span class=""char8"">t</span>   <span class=""char9"">l</span>   <span class=""char10"">e</span> </h1> Magical. Now the text is easy to manipulate in your CSS using an ordinal .char# pattern. This plugin assumes basic counting skills, but it's a pretty fast and easy way to get control over every letter. Letters, words, lines, and more! There you have it, but Lettering.js does even more! Lettering.js has the ability to split words and lines as well. If you want more information on how you can get radical with text, read the Lettering.js Wiki: https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js/wiki Best Practices We've found this to be a pretty quick and elegant solution to create typographical CSS3 posters. It's also a great solution for really custom type headings, while keeping the text selectable. Be smart and use sparingly. You'll probably break your browser if you try to wrap every letter on your page in a span tag, so don't do that. Look to use this in your Headings, Blockquotes, Asides, etc. Kern Well If you're going through the trouble to load a fancy font and that word or phrase is the largest on the site, then it's important for it to be kerned well. With Lettering.js, kerning is a breeze. You can simply use $(""#id-of-what-i-want-to-kern"").lettering(); and then on each .char#, you can set relative position or left/right margin. Works like a charm. Accessibility Lettering.js is now accessible by default. It uses an aria-label on the parent element and aria-hidden on each of the children to prevent screenreaders from pausing while reading each individual characters or words. Non-Javascript Fallback As with any kind of Javascript, have a fall back plan in case the user doesn't have javascript enabled. The bottom line is up to you, my bottom line would be ""legible and on the screen"". Also, use lettering.min.js Download the Minified Version of Lettering.js here Performance Anti-Pattern Web performance patterns advise that you put Javascripts at the bottom of your page before your </body> tag. There is an unfortunate side effect where you may experience a FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text) when you're manipulating your text after the DOM has loaded. Unfortunately, we found the best solution to avoid/minimize the FOUT caused by this plugin is to put your scripts (jQuery, Lettering.js) in the document <head>. On the one hand, your page will load slower. On the other hand, a flash/restyling makes your site feel slow. Users might ultimately feel the site is faster if they don't see the FOUT.

Refer to the jQuery Transit website for examples. Usage Just include jquery.transit.js after jQuery. Requires jQuery 1.4+. <script src='jquery.js'></script> <script src='jquery.transit.js'></script> It is also available via bower and npm. $ bower install --save jquery.transit $ npm install --save jquery.transit  Transformations You can set transformations as you would any CSS property in jQuery. (Note that you cannot $.fn.animate() them, only set them.) $(""#box"").css({ x: '30px' });               // Move right $(""#box"").css({ y: '60px' });               // Move down $(""#box"").css({ translate: [60,30] });      // Move right and down $(""#box"").css({ rotate: '30deg' });         // Rotate clockwise $(""#box"").css({ scale: 2 });                // Scale up 2x (200%) $(""#box"").css({ scale: [2, 1.5] });         // Scale horiz and vertical $(""#box"").css({ skewX: '30deg' });          // Skew horizontally $(""#box"").css({ skewY: '30deg' });          // Skew vertical $(""#box"").css({ perspective: 100, rotateX: 30 }); // Webkit 3d rotation $(""#box"").css({ rotateY: 30 }); $(""#box"").css({ rotate3d: [1, 1, 0, 45] }); Relative values are supported. $(""#box"").css({ rotate: '+=30' });          // 30 degrees more $(""#box"").css({ rotate: '-=30' });          // 30 degrees less All units are optional. $(""#box"").css({ x: '30px' }); $(""#box"").css({ x: 30 }); Multiple arguments can be commas or an array. $(""#box"").css({ translate: [60,30] }); $(""#box"").css({ translate: ['60px','30px'] }); $(""#box"").css({ translate: '60px,30px' }); Getters are supported. (Getting properties with multiple arguments returns arrays.) $(""#box"").css('rotate');     //=> ""30deg"" $(""#box"").css('translate');  //=> ['60px', '30px'] Animating - $.fn.transition $('...').transition(options, [duration], [easing], [complete])  You can animate with CSS3 transitions using $.fn.transition(). It works exactly like $.fn.animate(), except it uses CSS3 transitions. $(""#box"").transition({ opacity: 0.1, scale: 0.3 }); $(""#box"").transition({ opacity: 0.1, scale: 0.3 }, 500);                         // duration $(""#box"").transition({ opacity: 0.1, scale: 0.3 }, 'fast');                      // easing $(""#box"").transition({ opacity: 0.1, scale: 0.3 }, 500, 'in');                   // duration+easing $(""#box"").transition({ opacity: 0.1, scale: 0.3 }, function() {..});             // callback $(""#box"").transition({ opacity: 0.1, scale: 0.3 }, 500, 'in', function() {..});  // everything You can also pass duration and easing and complete as values in options, just like in $.fn.animate(). $(""#box"").transition({   opacity: 0.1, scale: 0.3,   duration: 500,   easing: 'in',   complete: function() { /* ... */ } }); Tests Transit has a unique test suite. Open test/index.html to see it. When contibuting fixes, be sure to test this out with different jQuery versions and different browsers. Alternatives Velocity.js (recommended!) Pros: optimized for situations with hundreds of simultaneous transitions. Lots of extra features. Move.js Pros: no jQuery dependency, great syntax. Cons (at time of writing): no iOS support (doesn't use translate3d), some IE bugs, no 3D transforms, no animation queue. jQuery animate enhanced Pros: transparently overrides $.fn.animate() to provide CSS transitions support. Cons: transparently overrides $.fn.animate(). No transformations support. jQuery 2D transformations Pros: Tons of transformations. Cons: No CSS transition support; animates via fx.step. jQuery CSS3 rotate Pros: simply provides rotation. Cons: simply provides rotation. No transitions support. Support Bugs and requests: submit them through the project's issues tracker. Questions: ask them at StackOverflow with the tag jquery-transit. Chat: join us at gitter.im.

The tool on bouncejs.com allows you to generate static keyframes that can be used without any extra JavaScript, but if you'd like your application to generate these on the fly, you can use the Bounce.js library. Installation The library is available to install from Bower or NPM: $ bower install bounce.js  # OR $ npm install bounce.js  You can also view and download all releases from here. Usage To create an animation, instantiate a new Bounce object: var bounce = new Bounce();  The Bounce object is what you'll use to first build your animation from the different components scale, rotate, translate and skew. This can then either be defined as a named animation for later use, or directly applied to elements on the page. Adding Animation Components As mentioned above, you'll use the scale, rotate, translate and skew methods to build your animation, just like with the Bounce.js tool. All of these methods accept a number of common options (explained further down) and from and to parameters that define the start and end points of the animation. Note that all of these methods are chainable. scale var bounce = new Bounce(); bounce.scale({   from: { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 },   to: { x: 1, y: 1 } });  The from and to parameters define the scale of the element on X (width) and Y (height) as a ratio. The example above animates the element from half size to full. (See it in action) rotate var bounce = new Bounce(); bounce.rotate({   from: 0,   to: 90 });  The from and to parameters define the rotation of the element in degrees. The example above animates the element a quarter rotation to the right. (See it in action) translate var bounce = new Bounce(); bounce.translate({   from: { x: 0, y: 0 },   to: { x: 100, y: 0 } });  The from and to parameters define the translation (position) of the element on X and Y in pixels. The example above animates the element 100 pixels to the right. (See it in action) skew var bounce = new Bounce(); bounce.skew({   from: { x: 0, y: 0 },   to: { x: 20, y: 0 } });  The from and to parameters define the skew of the element on X and Y in degrees. The example above animates the skew of the element 20 degrees on the horizontal axis. (See it in action) Common Animation Parameters All of the above methods accept these additional parameters: duration: The duration of the animation in ms. Defaults to 1000. delay: The delay of the animation in ms. Defaults to 0. easing: One of ""bounce"", ""sway"", ""hardbounce"", ""hardsway"". These are the same as in the ""Easing"" menu in the tool. Defaults to ""bounce"". bounces: The number of bounces in the animation. Defaults to 4. stiffness: The stiffness of the bounces in the animation, should be a value between 1 and 5. Defaults to 3. Using the Animation Once you've built your animation, you can either choose to define it as a named keyframe animation, or directly apply it to any element in the DOM. define var bounce = new Bounce(); bounce.rotate({   from: 0,   to: 90 }); bounce.define(""my-animation"");  Defines an animation with the given name. The animation can then be used in your CSS with animation: my-animation 1s linear both;. applyTo var bounce = new Bounce(); bounce.rotate({   from: 0,   to: 90 }); bounce.applyTo(document.querySelectorAll("".animation-target"")); // or with jQuery: bounce.applyTo($("".animation-target""));  Directly applies the animation to a single or a list of elements. This method also accepts a number of options: loop: Loops the animation infinitely if set to true. Defaults to false. remove: Removes the animation once it is complete. If your animation ends in a state different from what the element had before, the element will return to its original state in some browsers. Defaults to false onComplete: A callback function to be run after the animation is complete. If you're using jQuery, the method will return a promise to be used instead of the onComplete parameter: bounce.applyTo($("".animation-target"")).then(function() {    console.log(""Animation Complete"");  });  Remove An animation can also manually be removed once it has been defined: bounce.remove()  Browser Support You can check for support in the current browser with: Bounce.isSupported()  The library should work in all browser that support both 3D transforms and keyframe animations. Full Example Here's a full example of building the Splat animation preset in the tool and applying it to an element with class animation-target. var bounce = new Bounce(); bounce   .translate({     from: { x: -300, y: 0 },     to: { x: 0, y: 0 },     duration: 600,     stiffness: 4   })   .scale({     from: { x: 1, y: 1 },     to: { x: 0.1, y: 2.3 },     easing: ""sway"",     duration: 800,     delay: 65,     stiffness: 2   })   .scale({     from: { x: 1, y: 1},     to: { x: 5, y: 1 },     easing: ""sway"",     duration: 300,     delay: 30,   })   .applyTo(document.querySelectorAll("".animation-target""));  Developing If you'd like to run the Bounce.js site locally, and edit the JavaScript library, you can do so by cloning this repo and running the following commands (assuming that you have Node, NPM and Bower installed): # Install dependencies $ npm install $ bower install  # Start the server on localhost:9000. Watches for changes, automatically recompiles files and refreshes the browser. $ grunt serve   # Run the tests $ grunt test  Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

For example, if you start dragging an element and then while you're dragging, some other code causes the parent element to rotate or move or scale, perhaps you'd want the target element to adjust its position so that it remains stuck to the cursor/touch. That's possible now. yourDraggable.update(false, true);  - IMPROVED: compatibility with Node and build systems like Webpack and Browserify. You can import individual pieces of TweenMax, for example, in ES6 import statements, like: import {TweenMax, TimelineMax, Back, Quad} from 'gsap'; //or var TweenMax = require(""./libs/gsap/TweenMax.js"");  - IMPROVED: if you set/tween a transform-related property of an element that has its css ""display"" property set to ""none"" (or it has no parentNode) but also has a transform applied via CSS, GSAP now works around a browser issue that could cause those to be lost. Some browsers report the computed style of an element with display:none as ""none"" even if, for example, a CSS transform of ""rotate(30deg) scale(0.5, 0.5)"" was applied.  - FIXED: using a unit other than ""px"" when tweening ""border"" (like border:""10rem solid red"") works properly now.  - FIXED: the onStart callback of a zero-duration TimelineLite or TimelineMax fires now.  - FIXED: SplitText ignores extra white space now so that you won't get any extra ""lines"" where there are carriage returns or line breaks.  - FIXED: removed ""TweenLite"" dependency in SpliText.  - FIXED: if the last control point in a bezier path is directly on top of the final anchor point (rare), autoRotate could snap to -90 degrees (fixed now).  - FIXED: a non-zero initial rotation of a DOM element that was being animated with a BezierPlugin tween (with autoRotate enabled) didn't get returned properly when the tween was rewound fully.  - FIXED: if you TweenLite.ticker.addEventListener() *before* the first tick, it no longer immediately calls the listener (it waits for the next tick).

No other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, API efficiency, and tight control while solving real-world problems for animators. Stop wrestling with cumbersome CSS animations, stuttery jQuery.animate() calls, or a framework that limits your creativity. GSAP can animate any numeric property of any JS object, not just CSS properties. Getting started video Think of GSAP as the Swiss Army Knife of animation...but better. It animates anything JavaScript can touch (CSS properties, canvas library objects, SVG, generic objects, whatever) and it solves countless browser inconsistencies, all with blazing speed (up to 20x faster than jQuery), including automatic GPU-acceleration of transforms. See the ""Why GSAP?"" article for details. Most other libraries only animate CSS properties. Plus, their sequencing abilities and runtime controls pale by comparison. Simply put, GSAP is the most robust high-performance animation library on the planet, which is probably why Google recommends it for JS-based animations and every major ad network excludes it from file size calculations. Unlike monolithic frameworks that dictate how you structure your apps, GSAP completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want. This is the public repository for GreenSock's JavaScript tools like GSAP and Draggable. ""GSAP"" describes all of the animation-related tools which include TweenLite, TweenMax, TimelineLite, TimelineMax, various plugins (like CSSPlugin for animating CSS properties of DOM elements), extra easing functions, etc. Resources GSAP home page Getting started guide Examples & showcases Why GSAP?

(default: dynamics.easeInOut) frequency, friction, bounciness,... are specific to the animation type you are using duration is in milliseconds (default: 1000) delay is in milliseconds (default: 0) complete (optional) is the completion callback change (optional) is called at every change. Two arguments are passed to the function. function(el, progress) el is the element it's animating progress is the progress of the animation between 0 and 1 dynamics.stop(el) Stops the animation applied on the element dynamics.css(el, properties) This is applying the CSS properties to your element with the correct browser prefixes. el is a DOM element properties is an object of the CSS properties dynamics.setTimeout(fn, delay) Dynamics.js has its own setTimeout. The reason is that requestAnimationFrame and setTimeout have different behaviors. In most browsers, requestAnimationFrame will not run in a background tab while setTimeout will. This can cause a lot of problems while using setTimeout along your animations. I suggest you use Dynamics's setTimeout and clearTimeout to handle these scenarios. fn is the callback delay is in milliseconds Returns a unique id dynamics.clearTimeout(id) Clears a timeout that was defined earlier id is the timeout id dynamics.toggleSlow() Toggle a debug mode to slow down every animations and timeouts. This is useful for development mode to tweak your animation. This can be activated using Shift-Control-D in the browser. Dynamics and properties dynamics.spring frequency default is 300 friction default is 200 anticipationSize (optional) anticipationStrength (optional) dynamics.bounce frequency default is 300 friction default is 200 dynamics.forceWithGravity and dynamics.gravity bounciness default is 400 elasticity default is 200 dynamics.easeInOut, dynamics.easeIn and dynamics.easeOut friction default is 500 dynamics.linear No properties dynamics.bezier points array of points and control points The easiest way to output this kind of array is to use the curve creator.

Designing and developing UIs for the mobile web is tricky, but it's extremely difficult to do that while delivering something that performs at 60fps. The best opportunities to getting jank-free transitions on phones/tablets are CSS transition and keyframe animation based, especially tapping into hardware-accelerated transforms and opacity changes. @daneden did really nice work with Animate.css but I think the web would benefit if we could take that work to the next level. There's already been fantastic experiments and demos exploring CSS-based transitions, but it's distributed all over. Originally started at h5bp/lazyweb-requests#122 Effeckt Trailer Examples To Add tympanus.net/Development/ModalWindowEffects/ tympanus.net/Development/PageTransitions/ tympanus.net/Development/PFold/index2.html leaverou.github.io/animatable/ lab.hakim.se/ladda/ lab.hakim.se/kontext/ lab.hakim.se/avgrund/ lab.hakim.se/meny/ Because there are so many, I expect we could group things by role: button/touch effects state transition modal/notification transition attention attractors Goals Provide a minimal UI. Only use style hooks for transitions and animations. Designer-curated set of classy and reasonable effects. (no easeInBounce) Establish browser support guidelines (e.g. Android 2.3 would gracefully degrade) CSS performance regression testing (a la bench.topcoat.io) Deliver jank-free 60fps performance on target browsers/devices If a particular effect cannot deliver target performance (hey blur() css filter), it cannot be included. Guidelines on what to avoid when styling these affected elements (avoid expensive CSS) Deliver a builder so users can pull only the CSS they need. There is no hover on the mobile web, so any hover-based effects would be excluded or have a tap-based equivalent. Action If you know other transition/animation based demos/experiments that make sense to include here, file a ticket. If you're interested in helping to define the API, let's hear it! File a ticket. A web-based builder is a must. A command-line builder isn't important for this.

Great for emphasis, home pages, sliders, and general just-add-water-awesomeness. Installation To install via Bower, simply do the following: $ bower install animate.css --save Basic Usage Include the stylesheet on your document's <head> <head>   <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""animate.min.css""> </head> or use the version hosted by SmallCDN <head>   <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""http://s.mlcdn.co/animate.css""> </head> Add the class animated to the element you want to animate. You may also want to include the class infinite for an infinite loop. Finally you need to add one of the following classes: bounce flash pulse rubberBand shake headShake swing tada wobble jello bounceIn bounceInDown bounceInLeft bounceInRight bounceInUp bounceOut bounceOutDown bounceOutLeft bounceOutRight bounceOutUp fadeIn fadeInDown fadeInDownBig fadeInLeft fadeInLeftBig fadeInRight fadeInRightBig fadeInUp fadeInUpBig fadeOut fadeOutDown fadeOutDownBig fadeOutLeft fadeOutLeftBig fadeOutRight fadeOutRightBig fadeOutUp fadeOutUpBig flipInX flipInY flipOutX flipOutY lightSpeedIn lightSpeedOut rotateIn rotateInDownLeft rotateInDownRight rotateInUpLeft rotateInUpRight rotateOut rotateOutDownLeft rotateOutDownRight rotateOutUpLeft rotateOutUpRight hinge rollIn rollOut zoomIn zoomInDown zoomInLeft zoomInRight zoomInUp zoomOut zoomOutDown zoomOutLeft zoomOutRight zoomOutUp slideInDown slideInLeft slideInRight slideInUp slideOutDown slideOutLeft slideOutRight slideOutUp Full example: <h1 class=""animated infinite bounce"">Example</h1> Check out all the animations here! Usage To use animate.css in your website, simply drop the stylesheet into your document's <head>, and add the class animated to an element, along with any of the animation names. That's it! You've got a CSS animated element. Super! <head>   <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""animate.min.css""> </head> or use the version hosted by SmallCDN <head>   <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""http://s.mlcdn.co/animate.css""> </head> You can do a whole bunch of other stuff with animate.css when you combine it with jQuery or add your own CSS rules. Dynamically add animations using jQuery with ease: $('#yourElement').addClass('animated bounceOutLeft'); You can also detect when an animation ends: $('#yourElement').one('webkitAnimationEnd mozAnimationEnd MSAnimationEnd oanimationend animationend', doSomething); View a video tutorial on how to use Animate.css with jQuery here. Note: jQuery.one() is used when you want to execute the event handler at most once. More information here. You can also extend jQuery to add a function that does it all for you: $.fn.extend({     animateCss: function (animationName) {         var animationEnd = 'webkitAnimationEnd mozAnimationEnd MSAnimationEnd oanimationend animationend';         $(this).addClass('animated ' + animationName).one(animationEnd, function() {             $(this).removeClass('animated ' + animationName);         });     } }); And use it like this: $('#yourElement').animateCss('bounce'); You can change the duration of your animations, add a delay or change the number of times that it plays: #yourElement {   -vendor-animation-duration: 3s;   -vendor-animation-delay: 2s;   -vendor-animation-iteration-count: infinite; } Note: be sure to replace ""vendor"" in the CSS with the applicable vendor prefixes (webkit, moz, etc) Custom Builds Animate.css is powered by gulp.js, and you can create custom builds pretty easily. First of all, you’ll need Gulp and all other dependencies: $ cd path/to/animate.css/ $ sudo npm install Next, run gulp to compile your custom builds. For example, if you want only some of the “attention seekers”, simply edit the animate-config.json file to select only the animations you want to use. ""attention_seekers"": {   ""bounce"": true,   ""flash"": false,   ""pulse"": false,   ""shake"": true,   ""headShake"": true,   ""swing"": true,   ""tada"": true,   ""wobble"": true,   ""jello"":true } License Animate.css is licensed under the MIT license. (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) Contributing Pull requests are the way to go here. I apologise in advance for the slow action on pull requests and issues. I only have two rules for submitting a pull request: match the naming convention (camelCase, categorised [fades, bounces, etc]) and let us see a demo of submitted animations in a pen.

Textillate.js combines some awesome libraries to provide an easy-to-use plugin for applying CSS3 animations to any text. Usage Let's start with the basic markup: <h1 class=""tlt"">My Title</h1> And your JavaScript should look like this: $(function () {     $('.tlt').textillate(); }) This will animate using the default options. To change the defaults, you can either use the html data api: <h1 class=""tlt"" data-in-effect=""rollIn"">Title</h1> or pass in options on initialization (see full list of options below): $('.tlt').textillate({ in: { effect: 'rollIn' } }); You can also tell textillate.js to animate a list with the following markup: <h1 class=""tlt"">     <ul class=""texts"">         <li data-out-effect=""fadeOut"" data-out-shuffle=""true"">Some Title</li>            <li data-in-effect=""fadeIn"">Another Title</li>     </ul> </h1> $('.tlt').textillate(); Notice that you can control the animation parameters on each text (<li>) using the data api. Dependencies To start using textillate.js, you will need the following: jQuery lettering.js animate.css Options $('.tlt').textillate({   // the default selector to use when detecting multiple texts to animate   selector: '.texts',    // enable looping   loop: false,    // sets the minimum display time for each text before it is replaced   minDisplayTime: 2000,    // sets the initial delay before starting the animation   // (note that depending on the in effect you may need to manually apply    // visibility: hidden to the element before running this plugin)   initialDelay: 0,    // set whether or not to automatically start animating   autoStart: true,    // custom set of 'in' effects. This effects whether or not the    // character is shown/hidden before or after an animation     inEffects: [],    // custom set of 'out' effects   outEffects: [ 'hinge' ],    // in animation settings   in: {     // set the effect name     effect: 'fadeInLeftBig',      // set the delay factor applied to each consecutive character     delayScale: 1.5,      // set the delay between each character     delay: 50,      // set to true to animate all the characters at the same time     sync: false,      // randomize the character sequence      // (note that shuffle doesn't make sense with sync = true)     shuffle: false,      // reverse the character sequence      // (note that reverse doesn't make sense with sync = true)     reverse: false,      // callback that executes once the animation has finished     callback: function () {}   },    // out animation settings.   out: {     effect: 'hinge',     delayScale: 1.5,     delay: 50,     sync: false,     shuffle: false,     reverse: false,     callback: function () {}   },    // callback that executes once textillate has finished    callback: function () {},    // set the type of token to animate (available types: 'char' and 'word')   type: 'char' }); Events Textillate triggers the following events: start.tlt - triggered when textillate starts inAnimationBegin.tlt - triggered when the in animation begins inAnimationEnd.tlt - triggered when the in animation ends outAnimationBegin.tlt - triggered when the out animation begins outAnimationEnd.tlt - triggered when the in animation ends end.tlt - triggered when textillate ends $('.tlt').on('inAnimationBegin.tlt', function () {   // do something }); Methods $element.textillate('start') - Manually start/restart textillate $element.textillate('stop') - Manually pause/stop textillate $element.textillate('in') - Trigger the current text's in animation $element.textillate('out') - Trigger the current text's out animation Code Samples textillate.js + bounce.js Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

About Move.js is a small JavaScript library making CSS3 backed animation extremely simple and elegant. Be sure to view the ./examples, and view the documentation. Installation With component(1): $ component install visionmedia/move.js  With npm: $ npm install move-js  With a stand-alone build <script src='move.min.js'></script>  Example For example below we translate to the point (500px, 200px), rotate by 180deg, scale by .5, skew, and alter colors within a 2 second duration. Once the animation is complete we then() fade out the element by setting the opacity to 0, and shrink it with scale(0.1). move('.square')   .to(500, 200)   .rotate(180)   .scale(.5)   .set('background-color', '#888')   .set('border-color', 'black')   .duration('2s')   .skew(50, -10)   .then()     .set('opacity', 0)     .duration('0.3s')     .scale(0.1)     .pop()   .end();  Easing functions Built-in easing functions are defined as: 'in':                'ease-in' 'out':               'ease-out' 'in-out':            'ease-in-out' 'snap':              'cubic-bezier(0,1,.5,1)' 'linear':            'cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.250, 0.750, 0.750)' 'ease-in-quad':      'cubic-bezier(0.550, 0.085, 0.680, 0.530)' 'ease-in-cubic':     'cubic-bezier(0.550, 0.055, 0.675, 0.190)' 'ease-in-quart':     'cubic-bezier(0.895, 0.030, 0.685, 0.220)' 'ease-in-quint':     'cubic-bezier(0.755, 0.050, 0.855, 0.060)' 'ease-in-sine':      'cubic-bezier(0.470, 0.000, 0.745, 0.715)' 'ease-in-expo':      'cubic-bezier(0.950, 0.050, 0.795, 0.035)' 'ease-in-circ':      'cubic-bezier(0.600, 0.040, 0.980, 0.335)' 'ease-in-back':      'cubic-bezier(0.600, -0.280, 0.735, 0.045)' 'ease-out-quad':     'cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940)' 'ease-out-cubic':    'cubic-bezier(0.215, 0.610, 0.355, 1.000)' 'ease-out-quart':    'cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.840, 0.440, 1.000)' 'ease-out-quint':    'cubic-bezier(0.230, 1.000, 0.320, 1.000)' 'ease-out-sine':     'cubic-bezier(0.390, 0.575, 0.565, 1.000)' 'ease-out-expo':     'cubic-bezier(0.190, 1.000, 0.220, 1.000)' 'ease-out-circ':     'cubic-bezier(0.075, 0.820, 0.165, 1.000)' 'ease-out-back':     'cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.320, 1.275)' 'ease-out-quad':     'cubic-bezier(0.455, 0.030, 0.515, 0.955)' 'ease-out-cubic':    'cubic-bezier(0.645, 0.045, 0.355, 1.000)' 'ease-in-out-quart': 'cubic-bezier(0.770, 0.000, 0.175, 1.000)' 'ease-in-out-quint': 'cubic-bezier(0.860, 0.000, 0.070, 1.000)' 'ease-in-out-sine':  'cubic-bezier(0.445, 0.050, 0.550, 0.950)' 'ease-in-out-expo':  'cubic-bezier(1.000, 0.000, 0.000, 1.000)' 'ease-in-out-circ':  'cubic-bezier(0.785, 0.135, 0.150, 0.860)' 'ease-in-out-back':  'cubic-bezier(0.680, -0.550, 0.265, 1.550)' Build Move is packaged with a minified version, re-built each release.

Shuffle Images let you display and shuffle multiple images by moving cursor around or several other ways to trigger.This plugin is perfect for when you want to save space while allowing users to take a peak at what other images are related to the one displayed. It can also be used to create an interactive animation on multiple static images at once. Created by Pete R., Founder of Travelistly and BucketListly License: Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Demo View demo Compatibility Modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on desktop have been tested. Not tested on IE. Since the nature of this plugin requires mouse input, it may not work as expected on mobile. Basic Usage To use this plugin, simply include the latest jQuery library (preferably version 2.0.0 or higher) together with jquery.shuffle-images.js into your document's <head> follow by an HTML markup as follows: <body>   ..   <div class=""shuffle-me"">     <img src=""images/1.jpg"">     <img src=""images/2.jpg"">     <img src=""images/3.jpg"">     ..   </div>   .. </body>  Make sure all the images you want to shuffle are wrapped within a container where we will call the function on. Once that is set up, simply call the plugin like this:  $("".shuffle-me"").shuffleImages({    trigger: ""imageMouseMove"",     // Choose which type of trigger you want here. Available options are ""imageMouseMove"", ""imageHover"", ""documentMouseMove"", and ""documentScroll"". ""imageMouseMove"" will trigger when your mouse over the image and move your cursor. ""imageHover"" will trigger when you mouse over without moving your cursor. ""documentMouseMove"" will trigger when cursor is being moved anywhere on the page. ""documentScroll"" will trigger when you scroll the page. The default value is ""imageMouseMove""    triggerTarget: false,          // For ""imageMouseMove"", and ""imageHover"" only, you can set which element to trigger the image shuffle when mouse over. For example, if you want a container "".main"" to trigger an image shuffle instead of the image itself, put $("".main"") for this option. Default value is false.    mouseMoveTrigger: 50,          // For ""imageMouseMove"" only, you can set how many pixels you have to move in order to trigger one image shuffle. The lower the faster. The default value is 50.    hoverTrigger: 200,             // For ""imageHover"" only, you can set how long you have to hover the image until it shuffles to other images. The option accepts milliseconds without unit. The default value is 200.    scrollTrigger: 100,          // For ""documentScroll"" only, you can set how many pixels you have to scroll to see the image shuffle. The default value is 100.    target: ""> img""              // In case you have a complete HTML structure, you can set your own custom selector to your images here. The default value is ""> img"" which means images that are directly under the ""shuffle-me"" will be used to shuffle.  }); With the setup above, your images will be shuffled when you mouse over that particular image and you move around your cursor more than 50 pixels away from previous location. Markups You can individually assign each shuffle with its own trigger timing. Available markup are: data-si-mousemove-trigger You can define a custom mouseMoveTrigger option with this data attribute:   <div class=""shuffle-me"" data-si-mousemove-trigger=""100"">     <img src=""images/1.jpg"">     ...   </div> data-si-hover-trigger You can define a custom hoverTrigger option with this data attribute:   <div class=""shuffle-me"" data-si-hover-trigger=""1000"">     <img src=""images/1.jpg"">     ...   </div> data-si-scroll-trigger You can define a custom scrollTrigger option with this data attribute:   <div class=""shuffle-me"" data-si-scroll-trigger=""200"">     <img src=""images/1.jpg"">     ...   </div> Now your users can see several images while moving their cursor when they interact with the first image on your website.

Intro Imagine, for a second, how disorienting it would be if touching a doorknob teleported you to the other side of the door. Navigating the web feels like using a teleporting doorknob. Layouts change, elements rearrange or disappear, and it takes time for the user to adjust. Smooth transitions reduce the effort it takes for users to get settled into a new environment. Javascript SPA frameworks, sometimes referred to as MVC frameworks, are a common way to solve this issue. These frameworks often lose the benefits of unobtrusive code. Writing unobtrusive javascript gives us more resilience to errors, and improved performance and accessibility. How does smoothState.js work? smoothState.js provides hooks that can be used to choreograph how elements enter and exit the page during navigation. It uses the time the animations are running to fetch content via AJAX to inject into the page. smoothState.js doesn't dictate how things on the page should be animated. It supports CSS animations, as well as JS animation libraries like velocity.js. Design philosophy and requirements The project's main goal is to allow developers to add page transitions without having to add any logic to the backend. We keep things unobtrusive at all times. smoothState.js initializes on containers, not links. Think of a container as a small window object embedded in the page. Every URL on your site should return a full layout - not just an HTML fragment The smoothState container needs to have an id set - a unique hook to tell us what to update on the page All links and forms on the page should live within the container These requirements makes the website resilient, since it smoothState.js can abort and simply redirect the user if an error occurs. Making each link return a full page also ensures that pages are created with progressive enhancement in mind. Getting started All we need to do to get started is: Include a copy of jQuery and jQuery.smoothState.js on your page Add a container with an id of #main and include some links inside of it Create a new js file and run $('#main').smoothState() $(function() {   $('#main').smoothState(); }); By default, smoothState.js will: Prevent links and forms from triggering a full page load, if possible Use AJAX to request pages and replace the content appropriately Update URLs and browsing history so that browsing expectations aren't broken smoothState.js will not add page transitions to pages. You'll need to define the animations you want to run using the hooks smoothState.js provides. onBefore - Runs before a page load has been started onStart - Runs once a page load has been activated onProgress - Runs if the page request is still pending and the onStart animations have finished onReady - Run once the requested content is ready to be injected into the page and the previous animations have finished onAfter - Runs after the new content has been injected into the page and all animations are complete Options smoothState.js provides some options that allow customization of the plugin's functionality. The default options are overridden by passing an object into the smoothState function. Options example $(function(){   'use strict';   var options = {     prefetch: true,     cacheLength: 2,     onStart: {       duration: 250, // Duration of our animation       render: function ($container) {         // Add your CSS animation reversing class         $container.addClass('is-exiting');          // Restart your animation         smoothState.restartCSSAnimations();       }     },     onReady: {       duration: 0,       render: function ($container, $newContent) {         // Remove your CSS animation reversing class         $container.removeClass('is-exiting');          // Inject the new content         $container.html($newContent);        }     }   },   smoothState = $('#main').smoothState(options).data('smoothState'); }); debug If set to true, smoothState.js will log useful debug information to the console, instead of aborting. For example, instead of redirecting the user to a page on an error, it might log: No element with an id of “#main” in response from “/about.html”.  // Default $('#main').smoothState({ debug: false }); anchors A jQuery selector specifying which anchors within the smoothState element should be bound. // Default $('#main').smoothState({ anchors: 'a' }); hrefRegex A regular expression to specify which anchor with a specific href property based on the regex smoothState should bind to. If empty, every href will be permitted. // Default $('#main').smoothState({ hrefRegex: '' }); forms A jQuery selector specifying which forms within the smoothState element should be bound. // Default $('#main').smoothState({ forms: 'form' }); allowFormCaching Controls whether or not form submission responses are preserved in the cache. If set to true, smoothState will store form responses in the cache. This should be set to false unless you understand how caching form results will affect your website's behaviour very well. // Default $('#main').smoothState({ allowFormCaching: false }); repeatDelay The minimum number of milliseconds between click/submit events. User events ignored beyond this rate are ignored. This can be used to ignore double-clicks so that the user's browser history won't become cluttered by incompleted page loads. // Default $('#main').smoothState({ repeatDelay: 500 }); blacklist A jQuery selector specifying which elements within the smoothState element should be ignored. This includes both form and anchor elements. // Default $('#main').smoothState({ blacklist: '.no-smoothState' }); prefetch There is a 200ms to 300ms delay between the time that a user hovers over a link and the time they click it. On touch screens, the delay between the touchstart and touchend is even greater. If the prefetch option is set to true, smoothState.js will begin to preload the contents of the URL during that delay. This technique will increase the perceived performance of the site. // Default $('#main').smoothState({ prefetch: false }); prefetchOn The name of the events to listen to from anchors when prefetching. // Default $('#main').smoothState({ prefetchOn: 'mouseover touchstart' }); If you would like to throttle the prefetch, do so by firing custom events. Libraries like @tristen's hoverintent can be used to throttle prefetching based on the user's intent, by triggering a custom intent event. To use it with smoothState.js, set intent as the prefetchOn option. $('#main').smoothState({ prefetchOn: 'intent' }); Or, for the opposite effect, use something like @cihadturhan's jQuery.aim and add spider sense-like prefetching to smoothState.js. $('#main').smoothState({ prefetchOn: 'aim' }); cacheLength The number of pages to cache. smoothState.js can cache pages in memory, avoiding the user having to request pages more than once. Cached pages will load instantaneously. // Default $('#main').smoothState({ cacheLength: 0 }); loadingClass The class to apply to the body while a page is still loading, unless the page is received before the animations are complete. // Default $('#main').smoothState({ loadingClass: 'is-loading' }); scroll Scroll to top after onStart and scroll to hash after onReady. This is default behavior, if you want to implement your own scroll behavior, set scroll: false // Default $('#main').smoothState({ scroll: true }); alterRequest A function to alter a request's AJAX settings before it is called. This can be used to alter the requested URL, for example. // Default $('#main').smoothState({   // Param `request` is an `Object` that is currently set to be used   alterRequest: function(request) {     // Must return and `Object` that will be used to make the request     return request;   } }); alterChangeState A function to alter a history entry's state object before it is modified or added to the browser's history. This can be used to attach serializable data to the history entry, for example. // Default $('#main').smoothState({   // Param `state` is an `Object` that contains the container ID, by default   alterChangeState: function(state) {     // Must return a serializable `Object` that is associated with the history entry     return state;   } }); onBefore The function to run before a page load is started. // Default $('#main').smoothState({   // `$currentTarget` is a `jQuery Object` of the element, anchor or form, that triggered the load   // `$container` is a `jQuery Object` of the the current smoothState container   onBefore: function($currentTarget, $container) {} }); onStart The function to run once a page load has been activated. This is an ideal time to animate elements that exit the page and set up for a loading state. // Default $('#main').smoothState({   onStart: {     // How long this animation takes     duration: 0,     // A function that dictates the animations that take place     render: function ($container) {}   } }); onProgress The function to run only if the page request is still pending and onStart has finished animating. This is a good place to add something like a loading indicator. // Default $('#main').smoothState({   onProgress: {     // How long this animation takes     duration: 0,     // A function that dictates the animations that take place     render: function ($container) {}   } }); onReady The function to run when the requested content is ready to be injected into the page. This is when the page's contents should be updated. // Default $('#main').smoothState({   onReady: {     duration: 0,     // `$container` is a `jQuery Object` of the the current smoothState container     // `$newContent` is a `jQuery Object` of the HTML that should replace the existing container's HTML.     render: function ($container, $newContent) {       // Update the HTML on the page       $container.html($newContent);     }   } }); onAfter The function to run when the new content has been injected into the page and all animations are complete. This is when to re-initialize any plugins needed by the page. // Default $('#main').smoothState({   onAfter: function($container, $newContent) {} }); Methods and properties smoothState provides some methods and properties, made accessible through the element's data property. // Access smoothState var smoothState = $('#main').smoothState().data('smoothState');  // Run method smoothState.load('/newPage.html'); Properties href cache href The URL of the content that is currently displayed. cache An object containing the cached pages after they are requested. Methods load fetch clear restartCSSAnimations load(url) This loads the contents of a URL into our container. fetch(url) This fetches the contents of a URL and caches it. clear(url) This clears a given page from the cache. If no URL is provided it will clear the entire cache. restartCSSAnimations() This restarts any CSS animations applying to elements within the smoothState container. FAQ Help! My $(document).ready() plugins work fine when I refresh but break on the second page load. smoothState.js provides the onAfter callback function that allows you to re-run your plugins. This can be tricky if you're unfamiliar with how AJAX works. When you run a plugin on $(document).ready(), it's going to register only on elements that are currently on the page. Since we're injecting new elements every load, we need to run the plugins again, scoping it to just the new stuff. A good way to do this is to wrap your plugin initializations in a function that we call on both $.fn.ready() and onAfter. You'll want to specify the context each time you initialize the plugins so that you don't double-bind them. This is called a ""module execution controller"".

It does high quality image resize in browser as fast as possible. demo When you resize images using modern browsers' canvas low quality interpolation algorythms are used by default. That's why we wrote pica. It's not as fast as canvas, but still reasonably fast. With Lanczos filter and window=3 huge image resize (5000x3000px) takes ~0.5s on desktop and ~2s on mobile. In modern browsers pica automatically uses Webworkers, to avoid interface freeze and use multiple CPU cores in parallel. Why it's useful: reduces upload size for large images to pre-process in browser, saving time and bandwidth saves server resources on image processing HiDPI image technique for responsive and retina use single image for both thumbnail and detailed view Prior to use Pica is a low level library that does math with minimal wrappers. If you need to resize binary image, you should take care to load it into canvas first (and to save it back to blob). Here is a short list of problems you can face: Loading image: Due to JS security restrictions, you can load to canvas only images from same domain or local files. If you load images from remote domain use proper Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. iOS has resource limits for canvas size & image size. Look here for details and possible solutions. If you plan to show images on screen after load, you must parse exif header to get proper orientation. Images can be rotated. Saving image: Some ancient browsers do not support .toBlob() method, use https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob if needed. It's a good idea to keep exif data, to avoid palette & rotation info loss. The most simple way is to cut original header and glue it to resized result. Look here for examples. Quality JS canvas does not support access to info about gamma correction. Bitmaps have 8 bits per channel. That causes some quality loss, because with gamma correction precision could be 12 bits per channel. Precision loss will not be noticeable for ordinary images like kittens, selfies and so on. But we don't recommend this library for resizing professional quality images. Install node.js (to develop, build via browserify and so on): npm install pica bower: bower install pica API .resizeCanvas(from, to, options, callback) -> task_id Resize image from one canvas (or image) to another. Sizes are taken from source and destination objects. Return task ID to be able terminate it early. from - source canvas or image. to - destination canvas. options - quality (number) or object: quality - 0..3. Default = 3 (lanczos, win=3). alpha - use alpha channel. Default = false. unsharpAmount - >=0, in percents. Default = 0 (off). Usually between 50 to 100 is good. unsharpRadius - 0.5..2.0. Radius of Gaussian blur. If it is less than 0.5, Unsharp Mask is off. Big values are clamped to 2.0. unsharpThreshold - 0..255. Default = 0. Threshold for applying unsharp mask. callback(err) - function to call after resize complete: err - error if happened (!) If you need to process multiple images, do it sequentially to optimize CPU & memory use. Pica already knows how to use multiple cores (if browser allows). .terminate(task_id) Terminate resizing task by id, returned from resize function. .resizeBuffer(options, callback) Supplementary method, not recommended for direct use. Resize Uint8Array with raw RGBA bitmap (don't confuse with jpeg / png / ... binaries). It does not use tiles & webworkers. Left for special cases when you really need to process raw binary data (for example, if you decode jpeg files ""manually""). options: src - Uint8Array with source data. width - src image width. height - src image height. toWidth - output width. toHeigh - output height. quality - 0..3. Default = 3 (lanczos, win=3). alpha - use alpha channel. Default = false. unsharpAmount - >=0, in percents. Default = 0 (off). Usually between 50 to 100 is good. unsharpRadius - 0.5..2.0. Radius of Gaussian blur. If it is less than 0.5, Unsharp Mask is off. Big values are clamped to 2.0. unsharpThreshold - 0..255. Default = 0. Threshold for applying unsharp mask. dest - Optional. Output buffer to write data (callback will return result buffer anyway). callback(err, output) - function to call after resize complete: err - error if happened. output - Uint8Array with resized RGBA image data. .WW - true/false true if webworkers are supported. You can use it for browser capabilities detection. Also, you can set it to false for debuging. .WEBGL - true/false (experimental) false by default. Pica can use WebGL when available, if you enable this feature. But current implementation is not complete and not recommended for production. Result is noisy and code can crash. Though, you can enable it to investigate technology, test on different devices and provide feedback. pica.WEBGL = true; pica.debug = console.log.bind(console); What is quality Pica has presets, to adjust speed/quality ratio. Simply use quality option param: 0 - Box filter, window 0.5px 1 - Hamming filter, window 1.0px 2 - Lanczos filter, window 2.0px 3 - Lanczos filter, window 3.0px In real world you will never need to change default (max) quality. All this variations were implemented to better understand resize math :) Unsharp mask Pica has built-in unsharp mask. Set unsharpAmount to positive number to activate the filter. The parameters of it are similar to ones from Photoshop. We recommend to start with unsharpAmount = 80, unsharpRadius = 0.6, unsharpThreshold = 2. There is a correspondence between UnsharpMask parameters in popular graphics software. Browser support We didn't have time to test all possible combinations, but in general: Top level API should work in all browsers, supporting canvas and typed arrays. Webworkers support is not required, but they will be used if available. If you plan to use only pure math core, then typed arrays support will be enougth. Note. Though you can run this package on node.js, browsers are the main target platform. On server side we recommend to use sharp for better speed.

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropper.git. Install with NPM: npm install cropper. Install with Bower: bower install cropper. Installation Include files: <script src=""/path/to/jquery.js""></script><!-- jQuery is required --> <link  href=""/path/to/cropper.css"" rel=""stylesheet""> <script src=""/path/to/cropper.js""></script> The cdnjs provides CDN support for Cropper's CSS and JavaScript. You can find the links here. Usage Initialize with $.fn.cropper method. <!-- Wrap the image or canvas element with a block element (container) --> <div>   <img id=""image"" src=""picture.jpg""> </div> /* Limit image width to avoid overflow the container */ img {   max-width: 100%; /* This rule is very important, please do not ignore this! */ } $('#image').cropper({   aspectRatio: 16 / 9,   crop: function(e) {     // Output the result data for cropping image.     console.log(e.x);     console.log(e.y);     console.log(e.width);     console.log(e.height);     console.log(e.rotate);     console.log(e.scaleX);     console.log(e.scaleY);   } }); FAQ See the FAQ documentation. Notes The size of the cropper inherits from the size of the image's parent element (wrapper), so be sure to wrap the image with a visible block element. If you are using cropper in a modal, you should initialize the cropper after the modal shown completely. Otherwise, you will not get a correct cropper. The outputted cropped data bases on the original image size, so you can use them to crop the image directly. If you try to start cropper on a cross-origin image, please make sure that your browser supports HTML5 CORS settings attributes, and your image server supports the Access-Control-Allow-Origin option (see the HTTP access control (CORS)). Known issues Known iOS resource limits: As iOS devices limit memory, the browser may crash when you are cropping a large image (iPhone camera resolution). To avoid this, you may resize the image first (below 1024px) before start a cropper. Known image size increase: When export the cropped image on browser-side with the HTMLCanvasElement.toDataURL method, the the exported image'size may be greater than the original image's. This is because the exported image'type is not the same as the original image's. So just pass the original image's type as the first parameter to toDataURL to fix this. For example, if the original type is JPEG, then use $().cropper('getCroppedCanvas').toDataURL('image/jpeg') to export image. ⬆ back to top Options You may set cropper options with $().cropper(options). If you want to change the global default options, You may use $.fn.cropper.setDefaults(options). viewMode Type: Number Default: 0 Options: 0: the crop box is just within the container 1: the crop box should be within the canvas 2: the canvas should not be within the container 3: the container should be within the canvas Define the view mode of the cropper. dragMode Type: String Default: 'crop' Options: 'crop': create a new crop box 'move': move the canvas 'none': do nothing Define the dragging mode of the cropper. aspectRatio Type: Number Default: NaN Set the aspect ratio of the crop box. By default, the crop box is free ratio. data Type: Object Default: null The previous cropped data if you had stored, will be passed to setData method automatically. preview Type: String (jQuery selector) Default: '' Add extra elements (containers) for previewing. Notes: The maximum width is the initial width of preview container. The maximum height is the initial height of preview container. If you set an aspectRatio option, be sure to set the preview container with the same aspect ratio. If preview is not getting properly displayed, set overflow:hidden to the preview container. responsive Type: Boolean Default: true Re-render the cropper when resize the window. restore Type: Boolean Default: true Restore the cropped area after resize the window. checkCrossOrigin Type: Boolean Default: true Check if the current image is a cross-origin image. If it is, when clone the image, a crossOrigin attribute will be added to the cloned image element and a timestamp will be added to the src attribute to reload the source image to avoid browser cache error. By adding crossOrigin attribute to image will stop adding timestamp to image url, and stop reload of image. checkOrientation Type: Boolean Default: true Check the current image's Exif Orientation information. More exactly, read the Orientation value for rotating or flipping the image, and then override the Orientation value with 1 (the default value) to avoid some issues (#120, #509) on iOS devices.

ES6 is a significant update to the language, and the first update to the language since ES5 was standardized in 2009. Implementation of these features in major JavaScript engines is underway now. See the ES6 standard for full specification of the ECMAScript 6 language. ES6 includes the following new features: arrows classes enhanced object literals template strings destructuring default + rest + spread let + const iterators + for..of generators unicode modules module loaders map + set + weakmap + weakset proxies symbols subclassable built-ins promises math + number + string + array + object APIs binary and octal literals reflect api tail calls ECMAScript 6 Features Arrows Arrows are a function shorthand using the => syntax. They are syntactically similar to the related feature in C#, Java 8 and CoffeeScript. They support both statement block bodies as well as expression bodies which return the value of the expression. Unlike functions, arrows share the same lexical this as their surrounding code. // Expression bodies var odds = evens.map(v => v + 1); var nums = evens.map((v, i) => v + i); var pairs = evens.map(v => ({even: v, odd: v + 1}));  // Statement bodies nums.forEach(v => {   if (v % 5 === 0)     fives.push(v); });  // Lexical this var bob = {   _name: ""Bob"",   _friends: [],   printFriends() {     this._friends.forEach(f =>       console.log(this._name + "" knows "" + f));   } } More info: MDN Arrow Functions Classes ES6 classes are a simple sugar over the prototype-based OO pattern. Having a single convenient declarative form makes class patterns easier to use, and encourages interoperability. Classes support prototype-based inheritance, super calls, instance and static methods and constructors. class SkinnedMesh extends THREE.Mesh {   constructor(geometry, materials) {     super(geometry, materials);      this.idMatrix = SkinnedMesh.defaultMatrix();     this.bones = [];     this.boneMatrices = [];     //...   }   update(camera) {     //...     super.update();   }   get boneCount() {     return this.bones.length;   }   set matrixType(matrixType) {     this.idMatrix = SkinnedMesh[matrixType]();   }   static defaultMatrix() {     return new THREE.Matrix4();   } } More info: MDN Classes Enhanced Object Literals Object literals are extended to support setting the prototype at construction, shorthand for foo: foo assignments, defining methods, making super calls, and computing property names with expressions. Together, these also bring object literals and class declarations closer together, and let object-based design benefit from some of the same conveniences. var obj = {     // __proto__     __proto__: theProtoObj,     // Shorthand for ‘handler: handler’     handler,     // Methods     toString() {      // Super calls      return ""d "" + super.toString();     },     // Computed (dynamic) property names     [ 'prop_' + (() => 42)() ]: 42 }; More info: MDN Grammer and types: Object literals Template Strings Template strings provide syntactic sugar for constructing strings. This is similar to string interpolation features in Perl, Python and more. Optionally, a tag can be added to allow the string construction to be customized, avoiding injection attacks or constructing higher level data structures from string contents. // Basic literal string creation `In JavaScript '\n' is a line-feed.`  // Multiline strings `In JavaScript this is  not legal.`  // String interpolation var name = ""Bob"", time = ""today""; `Hello ${name}, how are you ${time}?`  // Construct an HTTP request prefix is used to interpret the replacements and construction POST`http://foo.org/bar?a=${a}&b=${b}      Content-Type: application/json      X-Credentials: ${credentials}      { ""foo"": ${foo},        ""bar"": ${bar}}`(myOnReadyStateChangeHandler); More info: MDN Template Strings Destructuring Destructuring allows binding using pattern matching, with support for matching arrays and objects. Destructuring is fail-soft, similar to standard object lookup foo[""bar""], producing undefined values when not found. // list matching var [a, , b] = [1,2,3];  // object matching var { op: a, lhs: { op: b }, rhs: c }        = getASTNode()  // object matching shorthand // binds `op`, `lhs` and `rhs` in scope var {op, lhs, rhs} = getASTNode()  // Can be used in parameter position function g({name: x}) {   console.log(x); } g({name: 5})  // Fail-soft destructuring var [a] = []; a === undefined;  // Fail-soft destructuring with defaults var [a = 1] = []; a === 1; More info: MDN Destructuring assignment Default + Rest + Spread Callee-evaluated default parameter values. Turn an array into consecutive arguments in a function call. Bind trailing parameters to an array. Rest replaces the need for arguments and addresses common cases more directly. function f(x, y=12) {   // y is 12 if not passed (or passed as undefined)   return x + y; } f(3) == 15 function f(x, ...y) {   // y is an Array   return x * y.length; } f(3, ""hello"", true) == 6 function f(x, y, z) {   return x + y + z; } // Pass each elem of array as argument f(...[1,2,3]) == 6 More MDN info: Default parameters, Rest parameters, Spread Operator Let + Const Block-scoped binding constructs. let is the new var. const is single-assignment. Static restrictions prevent use before assignment. function f() {   {     let x;     {       // okay, block scoped name       const x = ""sneaky"";       // error, const       x = ""foo"";     }     // error, already declared in block     let x = ""inner"";   } } More MDN info: let statement, const statement Iterators + For..Of Iterator objects enable custom iteration like CLR IEnumerable or Java Iterable. Generalize for..in to custom iterator-based iteration with for..of. Don’t require realizing an array, enabling lazy design patterns like LINQ. let fibonacci = {   [Symbol.iterator]() {     let pre = 0, cur = 1;     return {       next() {         [pre, cur] = [cur, pre + cur];         return { done: false, value: cur }       }     }   } }  for (var n of fibonacci) {   // truncate the sequence at 1000   if (n > 1000)     break;   console.log(n); } Iteration is based on these duck-typed interfaces (using TypeScript type syntax for exposition only): interface IteratorResult {   done: boolean;   value: any; } interface Iterator {   next(): IteratorResult; } interface Iterable {   [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator } More info: MDN for...of Generators Generators simplify iterator-authoring using function* and yield. A function declared as function* returns a Generator instance. Generators are subtypes of iterators which include additional next and throw. These enable values to flow back into the generator, so yield is an expression form which returns a value (or throws). Note: Can also be used to enable ‘await’-like async programming, see also ES7 await proposal. var fibonacci = {   [Symbol.iterator]: function*() {     var pre = 0, cur = 1;     for (;;) {       var temp = pre;       pre = cur;       cur += temp;       yield cur;     }   } }  for (var n of fibonacci) {   // truncate the sequence at 1000   if (n > 1000)     break;   console.log(n); } The generator interface is (using TypeScript type syntax for exposition only): interface Generator extends Iterator {     next(value?: any): IteratorResult;     throw(exception: any); } More info: MDN Iteration protocols Unicode Non-breaking additions to support full Unicode, including new Unicode literal form in strings and new RegExp u mode to handle code points, as well as new APIs to process strings at the 21bit code points level. These additions support building global apps in JavaScript. // same as ES5.1 ""𠮷"".length == 2  // new RegExp behaviour, opt-in ‘u’ ""𠮷"".match(/./u)[0].length == 2  // new form ""\u{20BB7}""==""𠮷""==""\uD842\uDFB7""  // new String ops ""𠮷"".codePointAt(0) == 0x20BB7  // for-of iterates code points for(var c of ""𠮷"") {   console.log(c); } More info: MDN RegExp.prototype.unicode Modules Language-level support for modules for component definition. Codifies patterns from popular JavaScript module loaders (AMD, CommonJS). Runtime behaviour defined by a host-defined default loader. Implicitly async model – no code executes until requested modules are available and processed. // lib/math.js export function sum(x, y) {   return x + y; } export var pi = 3.141593; // app.js import * as math from ""lib/math""; alert(""2π = "" + math.sum(math.pi, math.pi)); // otherApp.js import {sum, pi} from ""lib/math""; alert(""2π = "" + sum(pi, pi)); Some additional features include export default and export *: // lib/mathplusplus.js export * from ""lib/math""; export var e = 2.71828182846; export default function(x) {     return Math.log(x); } // app.js import ln, {pi, e} from ""lib/mathplusplus""; alert(""2π = "" + ln(e)*pi*2); More MDN info: import statement, export statement Module Loaders Module loaders support: Dynamic loading State isolation Global namespace isolation Compilation hooks Nested virtualization The default module loader can be configured, and new loaders can be constructed to evaluate and load code in isolated or constrained contexts. // Dynamic loading – ‘System’ is default loader System.import('lib/math').then(function(m) {   alert(""2π = "" + m.sum(m.pi, m.pi)); });  // Create execution sandboxes – new Loaders var loader = new Loader({   global: fixup(window) // replace ‘console.log’ }); loader.eval(""console.log('hello world!');"");  // Directly manipulate module cache System.get('jquery'); System.set('jquery', Module({$: $})); // WARNING: not yet finalized Map + Set + WeakMap + WeakSet Efficient data structures for common algorithms. WeakMaps provides leak-free object-key’d side tables. // Sets var s = new Set(); s.add(""hello"").add(""goodbye"").add(""hello""); s.size === 2; s.has(""hello"") === true;  // Maps var m = new Map(); m.set(""hello"", 42); m.set(s, 34); m.get(s) == 34;  // Weak Maps var wm = new WeakMap(); wm.set(s, { extra: 42 }); wm.size === undefined  // Weak Sets var ws = new WeakSet(); ws.add({ data: 42 }); // Because the added object has no other references, it will not be held in the set More MDN info: Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet Proxies Proxies enable creation of objects with the full range of behaviors available to host objects. Can be used for interception, object virtualization, logging/profiling, etc. // Proxying a normal object var target = {}; var handler = {   get: function (receiver, name) {     return `Hello, ${name}!`;   } };  var p = new Proxy(target, handler); p.world === 'Hello, world!'; // Proxying a function object var target = function () { return 'I am the target'; }; var handler = {   apply: function (receiver, ...args) {     return 'I am the proxy';   } };  var p = new Proxy(target, handler); p() === 'I am the proxy'; There are traps available for all of the runtime-level meta-operations: var handler = {   get:...,   set:...,   has:...,   deleteProperty:...,   apply:...,   construct:...,   getOwnPropertyDescriptor:...,   defineProperty:...,   getPrototypeOf:...,   setPrototypeOf:...,   enumerate:...,   ownKeys:...,   preventExtensions:...,   isExtensible:... } More info: MDN Proxy Symbols Symbols enable access control for object state. Symbols allow properties to be keyed by either string (as in ES5) or symbol. Symbols are a new primitive type. Optional description parameter used in debugging - but is not part of identity. Symbols are unique (like gensym), but not private since they are exposed via reflection features like Object.getOwnPropertySymbols. var MyClass = (function() {    // module scoped symbol   var key = Symbol(""key"");    function MyClass(privateData) {     this[key] = privateData;   }    MyClass.prototype = {     doStuff: function() {       ... this[key] ...     }   };    return MyClass; })();  var c = new MyClass(""hello"") c[""key""] === undefined More info: MDN Symbol Subclassable Built-ins In ES6, built-ins like Array, Date and DOM Elements can be subclassed. Object construction for a function named Ctor now uses two-phases (both virtually dispatched): Call Ctor[@@create] to allocate the object, installing any special behavior Invoke constructor on new instance to initialize The known @@create symbol is available via Symbol.create.

Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com> <@engelschall> Partially based on code snippets by Luke Hoban. Licensed under MIT license. This is the source of the website es6-features.org, a small overview of current ECMAScript 6 language features and a comparison to their old ECMAScript 5 equivalents. Frequently Asked Questions? (FAQ) Why was it setup? Is the ECMAScript 6 specification not enough? It was setup by computer scientist and software architect Ralf S. Engelschall in March 2015 in order to promote ECMAScript 6 in the software engineering projects around him and to have bookmarkable URLs at hand for referencing certain ECMAScript 6 features. Additionally, creating this website was a good approach for Ralf S. Engelschall to learn the new ECMAScript 6 features himself. Where can I find the current browser support status quo for ECMASCript 6? Have a look at the regularily updated ECMAScript compatibility table by kangax. There, especially notice the column ""Babel + core-js"" as this is what can be achieved today with transpiling (and that's fully sufficient for practice). Where can I find the latest ECMAScript 6 standard? The final ECMAScript 6 standard (ECMA-262) was published in June 2015. You can find the standard on ecmascript.org. How can I use ECMAScript 6 if my JavaScript runtime still does not support it? Use the awesome Babel transpiler. For Node.js/io.js environments just use its tricky require hook. For browser environments use Babel in conjunction with Browserify and its Babelify plugin. For other tools see Using Babel. If you want to see pre-integrated scenarios, check out our sibling project es6-support for various code examples! Why does the website default use the ""reduced"" syntactic sugar style (without semicolons) for ECMAScript 6 and the ""traditional"" syntactic sugar style (with semicolons) for ECMAScript 5? ECMAScript since its earliest days supported automatic semicolon inference/insertion, of course. But people coding ECMAScript 5 started it in an era where lots of tools (especially source code compressors) had problems when semicolons where left out from the source code. As a consequence, most ECMAScript 5 coders maintained the traditional coding style with semicolons as the syntactic sugar, although in most of the cases they are not necessary. But this era is gone today. Both ECMAScript 6 and all tools (including compressors) perfectly support automatic semicolon inference/insertion nowadays. As a consequence, ECMAScript 6 coders nowadays can get rid of nearly all semicolons and remove clutter from their source code. Ralf S. Engelschall is a strong promoter of reducing source code to its bare minimum. Hence, in his personal opinion ECMAScript 6 should be coded with as less syntactic sugar as possible and hence without semicolons. But if you disagree, just switch the shown style on the website. If you even need to enforce a particular style for both ES6 and ES5 code snippets in your bookmarks, just use one of the following URLs: ES6-Features (reduced style) or ES6-Features (traditional style) I still don't understand: why should I use ECMAScript 6? ECMAScript 5 looks sufficient. ECMAScript 5 is a nice and decent programming language, of course. But because of its history, it has some nasty aspects which ECMAScript 6 finally resolves. As programming never is just about getting the necessary functionality done, it is advised to also use the best language, too. ECMAScript 6's language design is cleaner than ECMAScript 5, its syntax increases the expressiveness of your code, it decreases the necessary boilerplate code (e.g. function vs. arrow syntax) and it especially let you get rid of some very nasty but required hacks and workarounds from the ECMAScript 5 era (e.g. var self = this). So, ECMAScript 5 might be sufficient, but ECMAScript 6 nevertheless is an important improvement. I've found a mistake, how can I contribute?

Contributions are welcome! Table of Contents var versus let / const Replacing IIFEs with Blocks Arrow Functions Strings Destructuring Modules Parameters Classes Symbols Maps WeakMaps Promises Generators Async Await Getter/Setter functions var versus let / const Besides var, we now have access to two new identifiers for storing values —let and const. Unlike var, let and const statements are not hoisted to the top of their enclosing scope. An example of using var: var snack = 'Meow Mix';  function getFood(food) {     if (food) {         var snack = 'Friskies';         return snack;     }     return snack; }  getFood(false); // undefined However, observe what happens when we replace var using let: let snack = 'Meow Mix';  function getFood(food) {     if (food) {         let snack = 'Friskies';         return snack;     }     return snack; }  getFood(false); // 'Meow Mix' This change in behavior highlights that we need to be careful when refactoring legacy code which uses var. Blindly replacing instances of var with let may lead to unexpected behavior. Note: let and const are block scoped. Therefore, referencing block-scoped identifiers before they are defined will produce a ReferenceError. console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined  let x = 'hi'; Best Practice: Leave var declarations inside of legacy code to denote that it needs to be carefully refactored. When working on a new codebase, use let for variables that will change their value over time, and const for variables which cannot be reassigned. (back to table of contents) Replacing IIFEs with Blocks A common use of Immediately Invoked Function Expressions is to enclose values within its scope. In ES6, we now have the ability to create block-based scopes and therefore are not limited purely to function-based scope. (function () {     var food = 'Meow Mix'; }());  console.log(food); // Reference Error Using ES6 Blocks: {     let food = 'Meow Mix'; }  console.log(food); // Reference Error (back to table of contents) Arrow Functions Often times we have nested functions in which we would like to preserve the context of this from its lexical scope. An example is shown below: function Person(name) {     this.name = name; }  Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {     return arr.map(function (character) {         return this.name + character; // Cannot read property 'name' of undefined     }); }; One common solution to this problem is to store the context of this using a variable: function Person(name) {     this.name = name; }  Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {     var that = this; // Store the context of this     return arr.map(function (character) {         return that.name + character;     }); }; We can also pass in the proper context of this: function Person(name) {     this.name = name; }  Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {     return arr.map(function (character) {         return this.name + character;     }, this); }; As well as bind the context: function Person(name) {     this.name = name; }  Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {     return arr.map(function (character) {         return this.name + character;     }.bind(this)); }; Using Arrow Functions, the lexical value of this isn't shadowed and we can re-write the above as shown: function Person(name) {     this.name = name; }  Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {     return arr.map(character => this.name + character); }; Best Practice: Use Arrow Functions whenever you need to preserve the lexical value of this. Arrow Functions are also more concise when used in function expressions which simply return a value: var squares = arr.map(function (x) { return x * x }); // Function Expression const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const squares = arr.map(x => x * x); // Arrow Function for terser implementation Best Practice: Use Arrow Functions in place of function expressions when possible. (back to table of contents) Strings With ES6, the standard library has grown immensely. Along with these changes are new methods which can be used on strings, such as .includes() and .repeat(). .includes( ) var string = 'food'; var substring = 'foo';  console.log(string.indexOf(substring) > -1); Instead of checking for a return value > -1 to denote string containment, we can simply use .includes() which will return a boolean: const string = 'food'; const substring = 'foo';  console.log(string.includes(substring)); // true .repeat( ) function repeat(string, count) {     var strings = [];     while(strings.length < count) {         strings.push(string);     }     return strings.join(''); } In ES6, we now have access to a terser implementation: // String.repeat(numberOfRepetitions) 'meow'.repeat(3); // 'meowmeowmeow' Template Literals Using Template Literals, we can now construct strings that have special characters in them without needing to escape them explicitly. var text = ""This string contains \""double quotes\"" which are escaped.""; let text = `This string contains ""double quotes"" which don't need to be escaped anymore.`; Template Literals also support interpolation, which makes the task of concatenating strings and values: var name = 'Tiger'; var age = 13;  console.log('My cat is named ' + name + ' and is ' + age + ' years old.'); Much simpler: const name = 'Tiger'; const age = 13;  console.log(`My cat is named ${name} and is ${age} years old.`); In ES5, we handled new lines as follows: var text = (     'cat\n' +     'dog\n' +     'nickelodeon' ); Or: var text = [     'cat',     'dog',     'nickelodeon' ].join('\n'); Template Literals will preserve new lines for us without having to explicitly place them in: let text = ( `cat dog nickelodeon` ); Template Literals can accept expressions, as well: let today = new Date(); let text = `The time and date is ${today.toLocaleString()}`; (back to table of contents) Destructuring Destructuring allows us to extract values from arrays and objects (even deeply nested) and store them in variables with a more convenient syntax. Destructuring Arrays var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]; var a = arr[0]; var b = arr[1]; var c = arr[2]; var d = arr[3]; let [a, b, c, d] = [1, 2, 3, 4];  console.log(a); // 1 console.log(b); // 2 Destructuring Objects var luke = { occupation: 'jedi', father: 'anakin' }; var occupation = luke.occupation; // 'jedi' var father = luke.father; // 'anakin' let luke = { occupation: 'jedi', father: 'anakin' }; let {occupation, father} = luke;  console.log(occupation); // 'jedi' console.log(father); // 'anakin' (back to table of contents) Modules Prior to ES6, we used libraries such as Browserify to create modules on the client-side, and require in Node.js. With ES6, we can now directly use modules of all types (AMD and CommonJS). Exporting in CommonJS module.exports = 1; module.exports = { foo: 'bar' }; module.exports = ['foo', 'bar']; module.exports = function bar () {}; Exporting in ES6 With ES6, we have various flavors of exporting. We can perform Named Exports: export let name = 'David'; export let age  = 25;​​ As well as exporting a list of objects: function sumTwo(a, b) {     return a + b; }  function sumThree(a, b, c) {     return a + b + c; }  export { sumTwo, sumThree }; We can also export functions, objects and values (etc.) simply by using the export keyword: export function sumTwo(a, b) {     return a + b; }  export function sumThree(a, b, c) {     return a + b + c; } And lastly, we can export default bindings: function sumTwo(a, b) {     return a + b; }  function sumThree(a, b, c) {     return a + b + c; }  let api = {     sumTwo,     sumThree };  export default api;  /* Which is the same as   * export { api as default };  */ Best Practices: Always use the export default method at the end of the module. It makes it clear what is being exported, and saves time by having to figure out what name a value was exported as. More so, the common practice in CommonJS modules is to export a single value or object. By sticking to this paradigm, we make our code easily readable and allow ourselves to interpolate between CommonJS and ES6 modules. Importing in ES6 ES6 provides us with various flavors of importing. We can import an entire file: import 'underscore'; It is important to note that simply importing an entire file will execute all code at the top level of that file. Similar to Python, we have named imports: import { sumTwo, sumThree } from 'math/addition'; We can also rename the named imports: import {     sumTwo as addTwoNumbers,     sumThree as sumThreeNumbers } from 'math/addition'; In addition, we can import all the things (also called namespace import): import * as util from 'math/addition'; Lastly, we can import a list of values from a module: import * as additionUtil from 'math/addition'; const { sumTwo, sumThree } = additionUtil; Importing from the default binding like this: import api from 'math/addition'; // Same as: import { default as api } from 'math/addition'; While it is better to keep the exports simple, but we can sometimes mix default import and mixed import if needed. When we are exporting like this: // foos.js export { foo as default, foo1, foo2 }; We can import them like the following: import foo, { foo1, foo2 } from 'foos'; When importing a module exported using commonjs syntax (such as React) we can do: import React from 'react'; const { Component, PropTypes } = React; This can also be simplified further, using: import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react'; Note: Values that are exported are bindings, not references. Therefore, changing the binding of a variable in one module will affect the value within the exported module. Avoid changing the public interface of these exported values. (back to table of contents) Parameters In ES5, we had varying ways to handle functions which needed default values, indefinite arguments, and named parameters. With ES6, we can accomplish all of this and more using more concise syntax. Default Parameters function addTwoNumbers(x, y) {     x = x || 0;     y = y || 0;     return x + y; } In ES6, we can simply supply default values for parameters in a function: function addTwoNumbers(x=0, y=0) {     return x + y; } addTwoNumbers(2, 4); // 6 addTwoNumbers(2); // 2 addTwoNumbers(); // 0 Rest Parameters In ES5, we handled an indefinite number of arguments like so: function logArguments() {     for (var i=0; i < arguments.length; i++) {         console.log(arguments[i]);     } } Using the rest operator, we can pass in an indefinite amount of arguments: function logArguments(...args) {     for (let arg of args) {         console.log(arg);     } } Named Parameters One of the patterns in ES5 to handle named parameters was to use the options object pattern, adopted from jQuery. function initializeCanvas(options) {     var height = options.height || 600;     var width  = options.width  || 400;     var lineStroke = options.lineStroke || 'black'; } We can achieve the same functionality using destructuring as a formal parameter to a function: function initializeCanvas(     { height=600, width=400, lineStroke='black'}) {         // Use variables height, width, lineStroke here     } If we want to make the entire value optional, we can do so by destructuring an empty object: function initializeCanvas(     { height=600, width=400, lineStroke='black'} = {}) {         // ...     } Spread Operator In ES5, we could find the max of values in an array by using the apply method on Math.max like this: Math.max.apply(null, [-1, 100, 9001, -32]); // 9001 In ES6, we can now use the spread operator to pass an array of values to be used as parameters to a function: Math.max(...[-1, 100, 9001, -32]); // 9001 We can concat array literals easily with this intuitive syntax: let cities = ['San Francisco', 'Los Angeles']; let places = ['Miami', ...cities, 'Chicago']; // ['Miami', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago'] (back to table of contents) Classes Prior to ES6, we implemented Classes by creating a constructor function and adding properties by extending the prototype: function Person(name, age, gender) {     this.name   = name;     this.age    = age;     this.gender = gender; }  Person.prototype.incrementAge = function () {     return this.age += 1; }; And created extended classes by the following: function Personal(name, age, gender, occupation, hobby) {     Person.call(this, name, age, gender);     this.occupation = occupation;     this.hobby = hobby; }  Personal.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype); Personal.prototype.constructor = Personal; Personal.prototype.incrementAge = function () {     Person.prototype.incrementAge.call(this);     this.age += 20;     console.log(this.age); }; ES6 provides much needed syntactic sugar for doing this under the hood. We can create Classes directly: class Person {     constructor(name, age, gender) {         this.name   = name;         this.age    = age;         this.gender = gender;     }      incrementAge() {       this.age += 1;     } } And extend them using the extends keyword: class Personal extends Person {     constructor(name, age, gender, occupation, hobby) {         super(name, age, gender);         this.occupation = occupation;         this.hobby = hobby;     }      incrementAge() {         super.incrementAge();         this.age += 20;         console.log(this.age);     } } Best Practice: While the syntax for creating classes in ES6 obscures how implementation and prototypes work under the hood, it is a good feature for beginners and allows us to write cleaner code. (back to table of contents) Symbols Symbols have existed prior to ES6, but now we have a public interface to using them directly. Symbols are immutable and unique and can be used as keys in any hash. Symbol( ) Calling Symbol() or Symbol(description) will create a unique symbol that cannot be looked up globally. A Use case for Symbol() is to patch objects or namespaces from third parties with your own logic, but be confident that you won't collide with updates to that library. For example, if you wanted to add a method refreshComponent to the React.Component class, and be certain that you didn't trample a method they add in a later update: const refreshComponent = Symbol();  React.Component.prototype[refreshComponent] = () => {     // do something } Symbol.for(key) Symbol.for(key) will create a Symbol that is still immutable and unique, but can be looked up globally. Two identical calls to Symbol.for(key) will return the same Symbol instance. NOTE: This is not true for Symbol(description): Symbol('foo') === Symbol('foo') // false Symbol.for('foo') === Symbol('foo') // false Symbol.for('foo') === Symbol.for('foo') // true A common use case for Symbols, and in particular with Symbol.for(key) is for interoperability. This can be achieved by having your code look for a Symbol member on object arguments from third parties that contain some known interface. For example: function reader(obj) {     const specialRead = Symbol.for('specialRead');     if (obj[specialRead]) {         const reader = obj[specialRead]();         // do something with reader     } else {         throw new TypeError('object cannot be read');     } } And then in another library: const specialRead = Symbol.for('specialRead');  class SomeReadableType {     [specialRead]() {         const reader = createSomeReaderFrom(this);         return reader;     } } A notable example of Symbol use for interoperability is Symbol.iterator which exists on all iterable types in ES6: Arrays, strings, generators, etc. When called as a method it returns an object with an Iterator interface. (back to table of contents) Maps Maps is a much needed data structure in JavaScript. Prior to ES6, we created hash maps through objects: var map = new Object(); map[key1] = 'value1'; map[key2] = 'value2'; However, this does not protect us from accidentally overriding functions with specific property names: > getOwnProperty({ hasOwnProperty: 'Hah, overwritten'}, 'Pwned'); > TypeError: Property 'hasOwnProperty' is not a function Actual Maps allow us to set, get and search for values (and much more). let map = new Map(); > map.set('name', 'david'); > map.get('name'); // david > map.has('name'); // true The most amazing part of Maps is that we are no longer limited to just using strings. We can now use any type as a key, and it will not be type-cast to a string. let map = new Map([     ['name', 'david'],     [true, 'false'],     [1, 'one'],     [{}, 'object'],     [function () {}, 'function'] ]);  for (let key of map.keys()) {     console.log(typeof key);     // > string, boolean, number, object, function } Note: Using non-primitive values such as functions or objects won't work when testing equality using methods such as map.get(). As such, stick to primitive values such as Strings, Booleans and Numbers. We can also iterate over maps using .entries(): for (let [key, value] of map.entries()) {     console.log(key, value); } (back to table of contents) WeakMaps In order to store private data versions < ES6, we had various ways of doing this. One such method was using naming conventions: class Person {     constructor(age) {         this._age = age;     }      _incrementAge() {         this._age += 1;     } } But naming conventions can cause confusion in a codebase and are not always going to be upheld. Instead, we can use WeakMaps to store our values: let _age = new WeakMap(); class Person {     constructor(age) {         _age.set(this, age);     }      incrementAge() {         let age = _age.get(this) + 1;         _age.set(this, age);         if (age > 50) {             console.log('Midlife crisis');         }     } } The cool thing about using WeakMaps to store our private data is that their keys do not give away the property names, which can be seen by using Reflect.ownKeys(): > const person = new Person(50); > person.incrementAge(); // 'Midlife crisis' > Reflect.ownKeys(person); // [] A more practical example of using WeakMaps is to store data which is associated to a DOM element without having to pollute the DOM itself: let map = new WeakMap(); let el  = document.getElementById('someElement');  // Store a weak reference to the element with a key map.set(el, 'reference');  // Access the value of the element let value = map.get(el); // 'reference'  // Remove the reference el.parentNode.removeChild(el); el = null;  // map is empty, since the element is destroyed As shown above, once the object is destroyed by the garbage collector, the WeakMap will automatically remove the key-value pair which was identified by that object. Note: To further illustrate the usefulness of this example, consider how jQuery stores a cache of objects corresponding to DOM elements which have references. Using WeakMaps, jQuery can automatically free up any memory that was associated with a particular DOM element once it has been removed from the document. In general, WeakMaps are very useful for any library that wraps DOM elements. (back to table of contents) Promises Promises allow us to turn our horizontal code (callback hell): func1(function (value1) {     func2(value1, function (value2) {         func3(value2, function (value3) {             func4(value3, function (value4) {                 func5(value4, function (value5) {                     // Do something with value 5                 });             });         });     }); }); Into vertical code: func1(value1)     .then(func2)     .then(func3)     .then(func4)     .then(func5, value5 => {         // Do something with value 5     }); Prior to ES6, we used bluebird or Q. Now we have Promises natively: new Promise((resolve, reject) =>     reject(new Error('Failed to fulfill Promise')))         .catch(reason => console.log(reason)); Where we have two handlers, resolve (a function called when the Promise is fulfilled) and reject (a function called when the Promise is rejected). Benefits of Promises: Error Handling using a bunch of nested callbacks can get chaotic. Using Promises, we have a clear path to bubbling errors up and handling them appropriately. Moreover, the value of a Promise after it has been resolved/rejected is immutable - it will never change. Here is a practical example of using Promises: var request = require('request');  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {   request.get(url, (error, response, body) => {     if (body) {         resolve(JSON.parse(body));       } else {         resolve({});       }   }); }); We can also parallelize Promises to handle an array of asynchronous operations by using Promise.all(): let urls = [   '/api/commits',   '/api/issues/opened',   '/api/issues/assigned',   '/api/issues/completed',   '/api/issues/comments',   '/api/pullrequests' ];  let promises = urls.map((url) => {   return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {     $.ajax({ url: url })       .done((data) => {         resolve(data);       });   }); });  Promise.all(promises)   .then((results) => {     // Do something with results of all our promises  }); (back to table of contents) Generators Similar to how Promises allow us to avoid callback hell, Generators allow us to flatten our code - giving our asynchronous code a synchronous feel. Generators are essentially functions which we can pause their execution and subsequently return the value of an expression. A simple example of using generators is shown below: function* sillyGenerator() {     yield 1;     yield 2;     yield 3;     yield 4; }  var generator = sillyGenerator(); > console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false } > console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false } > console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 3, done: false } > console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 4, done: false } Where next will allow us to push our generator forward and evaluate a new expression. While the above example is extremely contrived, we can utilize Generators to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner: // Hiding asynchronousity with Generators  function request(url) {     getJSON(url, function(response) {         generator.next(response);     }); } And here we write a generator function that will return our data: function* getData() {     var entry1 = yield request('http://some_api/item1');     var data1  = JSON.parse(entry1);     var entry2 = yield request('http://some_api/item2');     var data2  = JSON.parse(entry2); } By the power of yield, we are guaranteed that entry1 will have the data needed to be parsed and stored in data1. While generators allow us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner, there is no clear and easy path for error propagation. As such, as we can augment our generator with Promises: function request(url) {     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {         getJSON(url, resolve);     }); } And we write a function which will step through our generator using next which in turn will utilize our request method above to yield a Promise: function iterateGenerator(gen) {     var generator = gen();     (function iterate(val) {         var ret = generator.next();         if(!ret.done) {             ret.value.then(iterate);         }      })();  } By augmenting our Generator with Promises, we have a clear way of propagating errors through the use of our Promise .catch and reject. To use our newly augmented Generator, it is as simple as before: iterateGenerator(function* getData() {     var entry1 = yield request('http://some_api/item1');     var data1  = JSON.parse(entry1);     var entry2 = yield request('http://some_api/item2');     var data2  = JSON.parse(entry2); }); We were able to reuse our implementation to use our Generator as before, which shows their power. While Generators and Promises allow us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner while retaining the ability to propagate errors in a nice way, we can actually begin to utilize a simpler construction that provides the same benefits: async-await. (back to table of contents) Async Await While this is actually an upcoming ES2016 feature, async await allows us to perform the same thing we accomplished using Generators and Promises with less effort: var request = require('request');  function getJSON(url) {   return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {     request(url, function(error, response, body) {       resolve(body);     });   }); }  async function main() {   var data = await getJSON();   console.log(data); // NOT undefined! }  main(); Under the hood, it performs similarly to Generators. I highly recommend using them over Generators + Promises. A great resource for getting up and running with ES7 and Babel can be found here. (back to table of contents) Getter and setter functions ES6 has started supporting getter and setter functions. Using the following example: class Employee {      constructor(name) {         this._name = name;     }      get name() {       if(this._name) {         return 'Mr. ' + this._name.toUpperCase();         } else {         return undefined;       }       }      set name(newName) {       if (newName == this._name) {          console.log('I already have this name.');       } else if (newName) {         this._name = newName;       } else {         return false;       }     } }  var emp = new Employee(""James Bond"");  // uses the get method in the background if (emp.name) {    console.log(emp.name);  // Mr. JAMES BOND }  // uses the setter in the background emp.name = ""Bond 007"";  console.log(emp.name);  // Mr. BOND 007  Latest browsers are also supporting getter/setter functions in Objects and we can use them for computed properties, adding listeners and preprocessing before setting/getting: var person = {   firstName: 'James',   lastName: 'Bond',   get fullName() {       console.log('Getting FullName');       return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;   },   set fullName (name) {       console.log('Setting FullName');       var words = name.toString().split(' ');       this.firstName = words[0] || '';       this.lastName = words[1] || '';   } }  person.fullName; // James Bond person.fullName = 'Bond 007'; person.fullName; // Bond 007 (back to table of contents) Contact GitHub API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

Dec 27, 2013 tval Fix test on Windows Apr 1, 2015 README.md What is Traceur? Traceur is a JavaScript.next-to-JavaScript-of-today compiler that allows you to use features from the future today. Traceur supports ES6 as well as some experimental ES.next features. Traceur's goal is to inform the design of new JavaScript features which are only valuable if they allow you to write better code. Traceur allows you to try out new and proposed language features today, helping you say what you mean in your code while informing the standards process. JavaScript's evolution needs your input. Try out the new language features. Tell us how they work for you and what's still causing you to use more boilerplate and ""design patterns"" than you prefer. What now? What can Traceur do for me? Read the Getting Started page to get up and running. You can use some language features right now and even try it out in your browser here. Just type in some code and see what Traceur produces. For an idea of what is available and what we have in the pipeline, see the Language Features page. The JSConf 2011 presentation of Traceur describes the goals of the project and what it can do today. Some documentation is on the wiki on this site. Extra demos are in the source repository. We also presented Traceur at NodeConf 2011. The video is available on YouTube.

Since I didn't find out a better documentation for the JavaScript SDK, I'm here to gather and note down the knowledge of my personal experiences. JavaScript-SDK-Design is not just about SDK only, it's the connection between user and browser machine. The more native we write, the more we think, we do care about the performances and differences between platforms and browsers. Feel free to edit or you can drop me suggestions on the issue list.

""Short for software development kit, a programming package that enables a programmer to develop applications for a specific platform. Typically an SDK includes one or more APIs, programming tools, and documentation."" Design Philosophy It depends on your purpose of your SDK service and usage, but there must be native, short, fast, clean, readable and testable. Written in native JavaScript code, compiler language like Livescript, Coffeescript, Typescript and others are not recommend. There must be a better way to write your own JavaScript code in native faster than others. Please don't involve jQuery in your SDK unless it's really important, you can have other jQuery-like libraries, zepto.js, for the DOM manipulation. Or if you need the HTTP ajax request, use another light library like window.fetch. Once every SDK version released, make sure that it can be fitted into older and newer SDK version in the future. Hence, remember to write your Documentation for your SDK, comment in your code, unit test and user scenario test. Scope Based on the book Third-Party JavaScript In which case, you should design a JavaScript SDK for your application? Embedded widgets - Small interactive applications embedded on the publisher's web page (Disqus, Google Maps, Facebook Widget) Analytics and metrics - For gathering intelligence about visitors and how they interact with the publisher's website (GA, Flurry, Mixpanel) Web service API wrappers - For developing client-side applications that communicate with external web services. (Facebook Graph API) In what case we should use SDK in JavaScript environment? Suggest one. Include the SDK You are suggested to use Asynchronous Syntax for your script loaded. We want to optimize the user experience on the website as we don't want our SDK library to interfere the main web loaded. Asynchronous Syntax <script>   (function () {     var s = document.createElement('script');     s.type = 'text/javascript';     s.async = true;     s.src = 'http://xxx.com/sdk.js';     var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];     x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);   })(); </script> Target on the modern browser, you can use async. <script async src=""http://xxx.com/sdk.js""></script> Traditional Syntax <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://xxx.com/sdk.js""></script> Comparison Here's the simple graph to show the differentiate between Asynchronous and Traditional Syntax. Asynchronous:  |----A-----|     |-----B-----------|         |-------C------|  Synchronous: |----A-----||-----B-----------||-------C------|  Asynchronous and deferred JavaScript execution explained https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/BlockingJS You should avoid and minimize the use of blocking JavaScript, especially external scripts that must be fetched before they can be executed. Scripts that are necessary to render page content can be inlined to avoid extra network requests, however the inlined content needs to be small and must execute quickly to deliver good performance. Scripts that are not critical to initial render should be made asynchronous or deferred until after the first render. Problem of Asynchronous When you are using Asynchronous, you cannot execute your SDK function which script written within the page. <script>   (function () {     var s = document.createElement('script');     s.type = 'text/javascript';     s.async = true;     s.src = 'http://xxx.com/sdk.js';     var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];     x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);   })();    // execute your script immediately here   SDKName('some arguments'); </script> The result will lead to undefined because the SDKName() execute before the script loaded, therefore we should do some tricks and make sure the script execute successfully. The event will store in the SDKName.q queue array, your SDK should handle and execute SDKName.q and reinitial the namespace SDKName. <script>   (function () {     // add a queue event here     SDKName = SDKName || function () {       (SDKName.q = SDKName.q || []).push(arguments);     };     var s = document.createElement('script');     s.type = 'text/javascript';     s.async = true;     s.src = 'http://xxx.com/sdk.js';     var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];     x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);   })();    // execute your script immediately here   SDKName('some arguments'); </script> Or using [].push <script>   (function () {     // add a queue event here     SDKName = window.SDKName || (window.SDKName = []);     var s = document.createElement('script');     s.type = 'text/javascript';     s.async = true;     s.src = 'http://xxx.com/sdk.js';     var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];     x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);   })();    // execute your script immediately here   SDKName.push(['some arguments']); </script> Others There are other different ways to include a script Import in ES2015 import ""your-sdk""; Modular include a Script For full source code, see this awesome tutorial. Loading JavaScript Modules module('sdk.js',['sdk-track.js', 'sdk-beacon.js'],function(track, beacon) {   // sdk definitions, split into local and global/exported definitions   // local definitions   // exports });  // you should contain this ""module"" method (function () {    var modules = {}; // private record of module data    // modules are functions with additional information   function module(name,imports,mod) {      // record module information     window.console.log('found module '+name);     modules[name] = {name:name, imports: imports, mod: mod};      // trigger loading of import dependencies     for (var imp in imports) loadModule(imports[imp]);      // check whether this was the last module to be loaded     // in a given dependency group     loadedModule(name);   }    // function loadModule   // function loadedModule    window.module = module; })(); SDK Versioning Please avoid using your special case for version like brand-v<timestamp>.js brand-v<datetime>.js brand-v1-v2.js, it may cause the developer who use the SDK on confusing which is the latest version. Use Semantic Versioning to define your SDK Version in the form ""MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"". Version in v1.0.0 v1.5.0 v2.0.0 is easier for them to trace and search for the changelog documentation. Normally, we can have different ways to state the SDK version, it depends on your service and design. Using Query String path. http://xxx.com/sdk.js?v=1.0.0  Using the Folder Naming. http://xxx.com/v1.0.0/sdk.js  Using hostname (subdomain). http://v1.xxx.com/sdk.js  For the further development, you are advised to use stable unstable alpha latest experimental version. http://xxx.com/sdk-stable.js http://xxx.com/sdk-unstable.js http://xxx.com/sdk-alpha.js http://xxx.com/sdk-latest.js http://xxx.com/sdk-experimental.js  Changelog Document You should notice that your SDK user will not know if you upgrade your SDK without announcement. Remember to write a changelog to document your major, minor and even bug fix change. It will be a good developer experience if we can trace the changing API for the SDK. - Keep a Changelog, Github Repo Each version should have: [Added] for new features. [Changed] for changes in existing functionality. [Deprecated] for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases. [Removed] for deprecated features removed in this release. [Fixed] for any bug fixes. [Security] to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.  Namespace You should not define more than one global namespace in your SDK and prevent using the common word for your namespace to avoid collision with other libraries. On your SDK mainland, you should use (function () { ... })() to wrap all your source. This is an increasingly common practice, employed by many popular JavaScript libraries (jQuery, Node.js, etc.). This technique creates a closure around the entire contents of the file which, perhaps most importantly, creates a private namespace and thereby helps avoid potential name clashes between different JavaScript modules and libraries. # To avoid namespace collision Learning this from Google Analytics, you can define your namespace by changing the value ga (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); From OpenX experience, support a parameter to request the namespace. <script src=""http://your_domain/sdk?namespace=yourcompany""></script> Storage Mechanism Cookie The domain scope of using cookie is quite complex while involving the subdomain and path. For path=/, you have a cookie first=value1 in domain http://github.com, another cookie second=value2 in domain http://sub.github.com http://github.com http://sub.github.com first=value1 ✓ ✓ second=value2 ✘ ✓ You have a cookie first=value1 in domain http://github.com, cookie second=value2 in domain path http://github.com/path1 and cookie third=value3 in domain http://sub.github.com, http://github.com http://github.com/path1 http://sub.github.com first=value1 ✓ ✓ ✓ second=value2 ✘ ✓ ✘ third=value3 ✘ ✘ ✓ Check Cookie Writable Given a domain (Default as current hostname), check whether the cookie is writable. var checkCookieWritable = function(domain) {     try {         // Create cookie         document.cookie = 'cookietest=1' + (domain ? '; domain=' + domain : '');         var ret = document.cookie.indexOf('cookietest=') != -1;         // Delete cookie         document.cookie = 'cookietest=1; expires=Thu, 01-Jan-1970 00:00:01 GMT' + (domain ? '; domain=' + domain : '');         return ret;     } catch (e) {         return false;     } }; Check Third Party Cookie Writable It's impossible to check only using client side JavaScript, you need a server to do that. (Example) Write Read Remove Cookie Code Snippet Code for write/read/remove cookie script. var cookie = {     write: function(name, value, days, domain, path) {         var date = new Date();         days = days || 730; // two years         path = path || '/';         date.setTime(date.getTime() + (days * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));         var expires = '; expires=' + date.toGMTString();         var cookieValue = name + '=' + value + expires + '; path=' + path;         if (domain) {             cookieValue += '; domain=' + domain;         }         document.cookie = cookieValue;     },     read: function(name) {         var allCookie = '' + document.cookie;         var index = allCookie.indexOf(name);         if (name === undefined || name === '' || index === -1) return '';         var ind1 = allCookie.indexOf(';', index);         if (ind1 == -1) ind1 = allCookie.length;         return unescape(allCookie.substring(index + name.length + 1, ind1));     },     remove: function(name) {         if (this.read(name)) {             this.write(name, '', -1, '/');         }     } }; Session It's important to know that JavaScript is not possible to write Session, please refer to the server side team to implement Session. A page session lasts for as long as the browser is open and survives over page reloads and restores. Opening a page in a new tab or window will cause a new session to be initiated. LocalStorage Stores data with no expiration date, storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server. It's good to know that each localStorage from http and https in the same domain aren't shared. You can create an iframe inside the website and use postMessage to pass the value to others. HOW TO? Check LocalStorage Writable window.localStorage is not support in every browser, SDK should check available before using it. var testCanLocalStorage = function() {    var mod = 'modernizr';    try {        localStorage.setItem(mod, mod);        localStorage.removeItem(mod);        return true;    } catch (e) {        return false;    } }; Session Storage Stores data for one session (data is lost when the tab is closed). Check SessionStorage Writable var checkCanSessionStorage = function() {   var mod = 'modernizr';   try {     sessionStorage.setItem(mod, mod);     sessionStorage.removeItem(mod);     return true;   } catch (e) {     return false;   } } Event In client browser, there are events load unload on off bind .... Here's some polyfills for you to handle all different platforms. Document Ready Please do make sure that the entire page is finished loading(ready) before starting execution the SDK functions. // handle IE8+ function ready (fn) {     if (document.readyState != 'loading') {         fn();     } else if (window.addEventListener) {         // window.addEventListener('load', fn);         window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fn);     } else {         window.attachEvent('onreadystatechange', function() {             if (document.readyState != 'loading')                 fn();             });     } } DOMContentLoaded - fired when the document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading load event can be used to detect a fully-loaded page Information from JS Tip - https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips/blob/gh-pages/_posts/en/2016-02-15-detect-document-ready-in-pure-js.md Message Event It's about the cross-origin communication between iframe and window, read the API documentation. // in the iframe parent.postMessage(""Hello""); // string  // ==========================================  // in the iframe's parent // Create IE + others compatible event handler var eventMethod = window.addEventListener ? ""addEventListener"" : ""attachEvent""; var eventer = window[eventMethod]; var messageEvent = eventMethod == ""attachEvent"" ? ""onmessage"" : ""message"";  // Listen to message from child window eventer(messageEvent,function(e) {   // e.origin , check the message origin   console.log('parent received message!:  ',e.data); },false); The post message data should be String, for more advanced used in json, use JSON String. Although the modern browser do support Structured Clone Algorithm on the parameter, but not the 100% browser. Orientation Change Detect device orientation change window.addEventListener('orientationchange', fn); Get Orientation Rotate Degree window.orientation; // => 90, -90, 0 Screen portrait-primary, portrait-secondary, landscape-primary, landscape-secondary (Experimental) // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen/orientation var orientation = screen.orientation || screen.mozOrientation || screen.msOrientation; Disable Scroll In web page, use CSS style overflow: hidden, in some mobile web, this css doesn't work, use javascript event. document.addEventListener('touchstart', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }); // prevent scroll // or  document.body.addEventListener('touchstart', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }); // prevent scroll // use move if you need some touch event document.addEventListener('touchmove', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }); // prevent scroll Request The communication between our SDK and Server is using Ajax Request, as we know we can use jQuery ajax http request to communicate with Server, but there's a better solution to implement it. Image Beacon Use the Image Beacon to ask the browser to perform a method GET Request to get an Image. Remember to add timestamp (Cache Buster) to prevent caching in browser. (new Image()).src = 'http://xxxxx.com/collect?id=1111'; Some notice for GET Query String, there is the limit of length which is 2048(Basically It depends on different browser and server). You should do some tricks to handle if exceed length limit. if (length > 2048) {     // do Multiple Post (form) } else {     // do Image Beacon } You may have the problem on encodeURI or encodeURIComponent, it's better if you understand them. See below. For the image load success/error callback var img = new Image(); img.src = 'http://xxxxx.com/collect?id=1111'; img.onload = successCallback; img.onerror = errorCallback; Single Post Use the native form element method POST to send a key value. var form = document.createElement('form'); var input = document.createElement('input');  form.style.display = 'none'; form.setAttribute('method', 'POST'); form.setAttribute('action', 'http://xxxx.com/track');  input.name = 'username'; input.value = 'attacker';  form.appendChild(input); document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].appendChild(form);  form.submit(); Multiple Post The Service is often complex, we need to send more data through method POST. function requestWithoutAjax( url, params, method ){      params = params || {};     method = method || ""post"";      // function to remove the iframe     var removeIframe = function( iframe ){         iframe.parentElement.removeChild(iframe);     };      // make a iframe...     var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');     iframe.style.display = 'none';      iframe.onload = function(){         var iframeDoc = this.contentWindow.document;          // Make a invisible form         var form = iframeDoc.createElement('form');         form.method = method;         form.action = url;         iframeDoc.body.appendChild(form);          // pass the parameters         for( var name in params ){             var input = iframeDoc.createElement('input');             input.type = 'hidden';             input.name = name;             input.value = params[name];             form.appendChild(input);         }          form.submit();         // remove the iframe         setTimeout( function(){             removeIframe(iframe);         }, 500);     };      document.body.appendChild(iframe); } requestWithoutAjax('url/to', { id: 2, price: 2.5, lastname: 'Gamez'}); Iframe When you need to generate a content within the page, you can use iframe to embed your html. var iframe = document.createElement('iframe'); var body = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];  iframe.style.display = 'none'; iframe.src = 'http://xxxx.com/page'; iframe.onreadystatechange = function () {     if (iframe.readyState !== 'complete') {         return;     } }; iframe.onload = loadCallback;  body.appendChild(iframe); Remove extra margin from INSIDE an iframe <iframe src=""...""  marginwidth=""0""  marginheight=""0""  hspace=""0""  vspace=""0""  frameborder=""0""  scrolling=""no""></iframe> Putting html content into an iframe <iframe id=""iframe""></iframe>  <script>   var html_string= ""content <script>alert(location.href);</script>"";   document.getElementById('iframe').src = ""data:text/html;charset=utf-8,"" + escape(html_string);   // alert data:text/html;charset=utf-8.....   // access cookie get ERROR    var doc = document.getElementById('iframe').contentWindow.document;   doc.open();   doc.write('<body>Test<script>alert(location.href);</script></body>');   doc.close();   // alert ""top window url""    var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');   iframe.src = 'javascript:;\'' + encodeURI('<html><body><script>alert(location.href);</body></html>') + '\'';   // iframe.src = 'javascript:;""' + encodeURI((html_tag).replace(/\""/g, '\\\""')) + '""';   document.body.appendChild(iframe);   // alert ""about:blank"" </script> Script jsonp This is the case that your server needs to response JavaScript code and let the client browser execute it. Just include the JS script link.   (function () {     var s = document.createElement('script');     s.type = 'text/javascript';     s.async = true;     s.src = '/yourscript?some=parameter&callback=jsonpCallback';     var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];     x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);   })(); Know more about jsonp JSONP only works in GET HTTP request. JSONP lacks error handling, means you cannot detect case in response status code 404, 500 and so on. JSONP requests are always asynchronous. Beware of CSRF attack. Cross domain communication. Script response side (server-side) don't need to care about CORS. Navigator.sendBeacon() Look at the documentation. This method addresses the needs of analytics and diagnostics code that typically attempt to send data to a web server prior to the unloading of the document. Sending the data any sooner may result in a missed opportunity to gather data. However, ensuring that the data has been sent during the unloading of a document is something that has traditionally been difficult for developers. Send POST beacon through the API. It's cool. navigator.sendBeacon(""/log"", analyticsData); XMLHttpRequest Writing XMLHttpRequest is not a good idea. I assume that you don't want to waste time on battling with IE or other browsers. Here's some polyfills or code you can try window.fetch - A window.fetch JavaScript polyfill. got - Simplified HTTP/HTTPS requests microjs - list of ajax lib more Fragment Identifier Also known as hash mark #. Remember that request with hash mark at the end is not pass within http request. For example, you are in the page http://github.com/awesome#huei90 // Sending a request with a parameter url which contains current url (new Image()).src = 'http://yourrequest.com?url=http://github.com/awesome#huei90';  // actual request will be without # (new Image()).src = 'http://yourrequest.com?url=http://github.com/awesome';  // Solved, encodeURIComponent(url); (new Image()).src = 'http://yourrequest.com?url=' + encodeURIComponent('http://github.com/awesome#huei90'); Maximum Number of Connection Check the maximum number of browser's request connection. browserscope Component of URI It's important to know if your SDK needs to parse the location url.                          authority                    __________|_________                   /                    \               userinfo                host                          resource                __|___                ___|___                 __________|___________               /      \              /       \               /                      \          username  password     hostname    port     path & segment      query   fragment            __|___   __|__    ______|______   |   __________|_________   ____|____   |           /      \ /     \  /             \ / \ /                    \ /         \ / \     foo://username:password@www.example.com:123/hello/world/there.html?name=ferret#foo     \_/                     \ / \       \ /    \__________/ \     \__/      |                       |   \       |           |       \      |   scheme               subdomain  \     tld      directory    \   suffix                                    \____/                      \___/                                       |                          |                                     domain                   filename  Parsing URI Here's a simplest by using the native URL() Interface but it doesn't support all the browsers also not standard yet. var parser = new URL('http://github.com/huei90'); parser.hostname; // => ""github.com"" For the browser which doesn't have the URL() Interface, try DOM createElement('a'). var parser = document.createElement('a'); parser.href = ""http://github.com/huei90""; parser.hostname; // => ""github.com"" Debugging Simulating Multiple Domains You don't need to register different domain names to simulate multiple domain, you can just edit your operating system's hosts file. $ sudo vim /etc/hosts Add the following entries # refer to localhost 127.0.0.1 publisher.net 127.0.0.1 sdk.net Then you can access the page http://publisher.net and http://sdk.net Developer Tools Use the web debugging tools from browser vendors when debugging your SDK JavaScript code - Chrome Developer Tools Safari Developer Tools Firebug. Developer tools also short for DevTools. The DevTools provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application. Use the DevTools to efficiently track down layout issues, set JavaScript breakpoints, and get insights for code optimization. Console Logs For testing expected output text and other general debugging, Console Logs can be used throught the browser API console.log(). There are various typeways to format and output your messages, find out more Console API. Debugging Proxy Sometimes debugging proxy will give you a hand on testing your SDK. Debug traffic, modify cookies, headers, cache, edit http request/response, SSL Proxying, ajax debugging and more. Here's some software you can try FiddlerCore Charles Cellist BrowserSync BrowserSync makes your tweaking and testing faster by synchronising file changes and interactions across multiple devices. It’s wicked-fast and totally free. It really helps a lot if you need to test your SDK result in multiple cross devices. Try it =) Tips and Tricks Piggyback Sometimes, we don't want our developers include all the SDK source, we just need to do a simple 1x1 pixel request (for example: return a request when landing on thank you/last page). All we need to do is ask the developer to include an image file with our url link. <img height=""1"" width=""1"" alt="""" style=""display:none"" src=""https://yourUrlLink.com/t?timestamp=1234567890&type=page1&currency=USD&noscript=1"" /> Page Visibility API Sometimes, your SDK wants to detect the user is whether focus your page. Try the polyfills visibly.js and visibilityjs. Document Referrer Use document.referrer to get the url of current previous page. But remember that this referrer is ""Browser Referrer"" not the ""Human Known Referrer"". If you click the browser back button, for example pageA -> pageB -> pageC -> (back button) pageB, current pageB's referrer is pageA, not pageC. Console Logs Polyfill It's not a real polyfill, just make sure that calling console.log API doesn't throw error event to client side. if (typeof console === ""undefined"") {     var f = function() {};     console = {         log: f,         debug: f,         error: f,         info: f     }; } EncodeURI or EncodeURIComponent Understand the difference between escape() encodeURI() encodeURIComponent() here. Remember that using encodeURI() and encodeURIComponent() has exactly 11 characters difference. These characters are: # $ & + , / : ; = ? @ more discussion. YOU MIGHT NOT NEED JQUERY As the title said, you might not need jquery. It's really useful if you are looking for some utilities code - AJAX EFFECTS, ELEMENTS, EVENTS, UTILS You Don't Need jQuery Free yourself from the chains of jQuery by embracing and understanding the modern Web API and discovering various directed libraries to help you fill in the gaps. http://blog.garstasio.com/you-dont-need-jquery/ Useful Tips Selecting Elements DOM Manipulation Load Script with Callback It's similar to asynchrnous script loading with addition callback event function loadScript(url, callback) {   var script = document.createElement('script');   script.async = true;   script.src = url;    var entry = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];   entry.parentNode.insertBefore(script, entry);    script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = function () {     var rdyState = script.readyState;      if (!rdyState || /complete|loaded/.test(script.readyState)) {       callback();        // detach the event handler to avoid memory leaks in IE (http://mng.bz/W8fx)       script.onload = null;       script.onreadystatechange = null;     }   }; } Once Function Here show how to implement the function once Every so often you have a function which you only want to run once. Oftentimes these functions are in the form of event listeners which may be difficult to manage. Of course if they were easy to manage, you'd just remove the listeners but that's a perfect world and sometimes you simply want the ability to only allow a function to be called once. Here's the JavaScript function to make that possible! // Copy from DWB // http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-once function once(fn, context) {      var result;      return function() {          if(fn) {             result = fn.apply(context || this, arguments);             fn = null;         }          return result;     }; }  // Usage var canOnlyFireOnce = once(function() {     console.log('Fired!'); });  canOnlyFireOnce(); // ""Fired!"" canOnlyFireOnce(); // nada Pixel Ratio Density If you stuck on the term pixel, ratio, density, dimension, what while developing mobile web, try understanding the video, it may help.

The misspelling was set in stone by the time of its incorporation into the Request for Comments standards document RFC 1945; document co-author Roy Fielding has remarked that neither ""referrer"" nor the misspelling ""referer"" were recognized by the standard Unix spell checker of the period. ""Referer"" has since become a widely used spelling in the industry when discussing HTTP referrers; usage of the misspelling is not universal, though, as the correct spelling ""referrer"" is used in some web specifications such as the Document Object Model.

An awesome example Too simple like: Get my User then retrieve my Playlist, then add a Track to one Playlist. user.me().then((myUser) => { // -> return a User entity with helpers     myUser.playlists().then((playlistsCollection) => {         playlistsCollection.first().tracks // -> tracksCollections         playlistsCollection.first().addTrack(trackEntity) // -> add a track to the playlist     }); }); More Examples Basic example Complex example Showcase - Projects using Spotify-SDK - MagicPlaylist - 20v - Infinite Music Trivia Getting Started You can get it on npm. npm install spotify-sdk --save How to start? After installing, you should add the SDK to your project. import {Client, TrackHandler, PlaylistHandler} from 'spotify-sdk'; You can import all entities, handlers and resources of the library. Init the client let client = Client.instance;  client.settings = {     clientId: 'CLIENT_ID',     secretId: 'SECRET_ID' }; If your applications require methods that need authentication: client.settings = {     clientId: 'CLIENT_ID',     secretId: 'SECRET_ID',     scopes: [SCOPE, SCOPE2],     redirect_uri: 'REDIRECT_URL' };  client.token = 'TOKEN'; Here there is a suggested implementation for login.

Echo is fast, 2KB, and uses HTML5 data-* attributes for simple. Check out a demo. Echo works in IE8+. bower install echojs npm install echo-js  Using Echo.js is simple, to add an image directly into the page simply add a data-echo attribute to the img tag. Alternatively if you want to use Echo to lazy load background images simply add a `data-echo-background' attribute to the element with the image URL. <body>    <img src=""img/blank.gif"" alt=""Photo"" data-echo=""img/photo.jpg"">    <script src=""dist/echo.js""></script>   <script>   echo.init({     offset: 100,     throttle: 250,     unload: false,     callback: function (element, op) {       console.log(element, 'has been', op + 'ed')     }   });    // echo.render(); is also available for non-scroll callbacks   </script> </body> .init() (options) The init() API takes a few options offset Type: Number|String Default: 0 The offset option allows you to specify how far below, above, to the left, and to the right of the viewport you want Echo to begin loading your images. If you specify 0, Echo will load your image as soon as it is visible in the viewport, if you want to load 1000px below or above the viewport, use 1000. offsetVertical Type: Number|String Default: offset's value The offsetVertical option allows you to specify how far above and below the viewport you want Echo to begin loading your images. offsetHorizontal Type: Number|String Default: offset's value The offsetHorizontal option allows you to specify how far to the left and right of the viewport you want Echo to begin loading your images. offsetTop Type: Number|String Default: offsetVertical's value The offsetTop option allows you to specify how far above the viewport you want Echo to begin loading your images. offsetBottom Type: Number|String Default: offsetVertical's value The offsetBottom option allows you to specify how far below the viewport you want Echo to begin loading your images. offsetLeft Type: Number|String Default: offsetVertical's value The offsetLeft option allows you to specify how far to left of the viewport you want Echo to begin loading your images. offsetRight Type: Number|String Default: offsetVertical's value The offsetRight option allows you to specify how far to the right of the viewport you want Echo to begin loading your images. throttle Type: Number|String Default: 250 The throttle is managed by an internal function that prevents performance issues from continuous firing of window.onscroll events. Using a throttle will set a small timeout when the user scrolls and will keep throttling until the user stops. The default is 250 milliseconds. debounce Type: Boolean Default: true By default the throttling function is actually a debounce function so that the checking function is only triggered after a user stops scrolling. To use traditional throttling where it will only check the images every throttle milliseconds, set debounce to false. unload Type: Boolean Default: false This option will tell echo to unload loaded images once they have scrolled beyond the viewport (including the offset area). callback Type: Function The callback will be passed the element that has been updated and what the update operation was (ie load or unload). This can be useful if you want to add a class like loaded to the element. Or do some logging. echo.init({   callback: function(element, op) {     if(op === 'load') {       element.classList.add('loaded');     } else {       element.classList.remove('loaded');     }   } }); .render() Echo's callback render() can be used to make Echo poll your images when you're not scrolling, for instance if you've got a filter layout that swaps images but does not scroll, you need to call the internal functions without scrolling. Use render() for this: echo.render(); Using render() is also throttled, which means you can bind it to an onresize event and it will be optimised for performance in the same way onscroll is. Manual installation Drop your files into your required folders, make sure you're using the file(s) from the dist folder, which is the compiled production-ready code. Ensure you place the script before the closing </body> tag so the DOM tree is populated when the script runs. Configuring Echo Add the image that needs to load when it's visible inside the viewport in a data-echo attribute: <img src=""img/blank.gif"" alt=""Photo"" data-echo=""img/photo.jpg""> Contributing In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.

Authors: See Authors.txt License: MIT Picturefill has three versions: Version 1 mimics the Picture element pattern with span elements. It is no longer maintained. Version 2 is a lightweight polyfill of the Picture element draft specification. Version 3.0.2 is the current stable release. Usage, Demos, Docs To find out how to use Picturefill, visit the project site. The gotchas Be it browser issues, the responsive images specifications, or Picturefill itself, there are a couple gotchas you should be aware of when working with Picturefill: Firefox 38 and 39 has some bugs [1] [2] [3] where images won't update on screen resize. These issues are addressed by Picturefill 3.0.0, and was fixed in Firefox 41. Per the picture spec, using % isn't allowed in the sizes attribute. Using % will fallback to 100vw. Trying to use the src attribute in a browser that doesn't support picture natively can result in a double download. To avoid this, don't use the src attribute on the img tag: <picture>     <source srcset=""../img/sample.svg"" media=""(min-width: 768px)"" />     <img srcset=""default.png"" alt=""Sample pic"" /> </picture> If you only want to have an image show up at certain sizes, and not show up at others, you will need to use a transparent placeholder gif: <picture>     <source srcset=""../img/sample.svg"" media=""(min-width: 768px)"" />     <img srcset=""data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==""         alt=""Sample pic"" /> </picture> Contributing For information on how to contribute code to Picturefill, check out CONTRIBUTING.md Issues If you find a bug in Picturefill, please add it to the issue tracker Discussion Picturefill discussion takes place via Slack.

The current version is 3.3.2. Development Version (43 KB; uncompressed with comments) Production Version (3.5 KB; compressed and gzip-ped) Change Log Special thanks to cdnjs and jsDelivr for hosting CDN copies of JSON 3. JSON is a language-independent data interchange format based on a loose subset of the JavaScript grammar. Originally popularized by Douglas Crockford, the format was standardized in the fifth edition of the ECMAScript specification. The 5.1 edition, ratified in June 2011, incorporates several modifications to the grammar pertaining to the serialization of dates. JSON 3 exposes two functions: stringify() for serializing a JavaScript value to JSON, and parse() for producing a JavaScript value from a JSON source string. It is a drop-in replacement for JSON 2. The functions behave exactly as described in the ECMAScript spec, except for the date serialization discrepancy noted below. The JSON 3 parser does not use eval or regular expressions. This provides security and performance benefits in obsolete and mobile environments, where the margin is particularly significant. The complete benchmark suite is available on jsPerf. The project is hosted on GitHub, along with the unit tests. It is part of the BestieJS family, a collection of best-in-class JavaScript libraries that promote cross-platform support, specification precedents, unit testing, and plenty of documentation. Changes from JSON 2 JSON 3… Correctly serializes primitive wrapper objects. Throws a TypeError when serializing cyclic structures (JSON 2 recurses until the call stack overflows). Utilizes feature tests to detect broken or incomplete native JSON implementations (JSON 2 only checks for the presence of the native functions). The tests are only executed once at runtime, so there is no additional performance cost when parsing or serializing values. As of v3.2.3, JSON 3 is compatible with Prototype 1.6.1 and older. In contrast to JSON 2, JSON 3 does not… Add toJSON() methods to the Boolean, Number, and String prototypes. These are not part of any standard, and are made redundant by the design of the stringify() implementation. Add toJSON() or toISOString() methods to Date.prototype. See the note about date serialization below. Date Serialization JSON 3 deviates from the specification in one important way: it does not define Date#toISOString() or Date#toJSON(). This preserves CommonJS compatibility and avoids polluting native prototypes. Instead, date serialization is performed internally by the stringify() implementation: if a date object does not define a custom toJSON() method, it is serialized as a simplified ISO 8601 date-time string. Several native Date#toJSON() implementations produce date time strings that do not conform to the grammar outlined in the spec. For instance, all versions of Safari 4, as well as JSON 2, fail to serialize extended years correctly. Furthermore, JSON 2 and older implementations omit the milliseconds from the date-time string (optional in ES 5, but required in 5.1). Finally, in all versions of Safari 4 and 5, serializing an invalid date will produce the string ""Invalid Date"", rather than null. Because these environments exhibit other serialization bugs, however, JSON 3 will override the native stringify() implementation. Portions of the date serialization code are adapted from the date-shim project. Usage Web Browsers <script src=""//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/json3/3.3.2/json3.min.js""></script> <script>   JSON.stringify({""Hello"": 123});   // => '{""Hello"":123}'   JSON.parse(""[[1, 2, 3], 1, 2, 3, 4]"", function (key, value) {     if (typeof value == ""number"") {       value = value % 2 ? ""Odd"" : ""Even"";     }     return value;   });   // => [[""Odd"", ""Even"", ""Odd""], ""Odd"", ""Even"", ""Odd"", ""Even""] </script>  When used in a web browser, JSON 3 exposes an additional JSON3 object containing the noConflict() and runInContext() functions, as well as aliases to the stringify() and parse() functions. noConflict and runInContext JSON3.noConflict() restores the original value of the global JSON object and returns a reference to the JSON3 object. JSON3.runInContext([context, exports]) initializes JSON 3 using the given context object (e.g., window, global, etc.), or the global object if omitted. If an exports object is specified, the stringify(), parse(), and runInContext() functions will be attached to it instead of a new object. Asynchronous Module Loaders JSON 3 is defined as an anonymous module for compatibility with RequireJS, curl.js, and other asynchronous module loaders. <script src=""//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.1.10/require.js""></script> <script>   require({     ""paths"": {       ""json3"": ""./path/to/json3""     }   }, [""json3""], function (JSON) {     JSON.parse(""[1, 2, 3]"");     // => [1, 2, 3]   }); </script>  To avoid issues with third-party scripts, JSON 3 is exported to the global scope even when used with a module loader. If this behavior is undesired, JSON3.noConflict() can be used to restore the global JSON object to its original value. Note: If you intend to use JSON3 alongside another module, please do not simply concatenate these modules together, as that would cause multiple define calls in one script, resulting in errors in AMD loaders. The r.js build optimizer can be used instead if you need a single compressed file for production. CommonJS Environments var JSON3 = require(""./path/to/json3""); JSON3.parse(""[1, 2, 3]""); // => [1, 2, 3]  JavaScript Engines load(""path/to/json3.js""); JSON.stringify({""Hello"": 123, ""Good-bye"": 456}, [""Hello""], ""\t""); // => '{\n\t""Hello"": 123\n}'  Compatibility JSON 3 has been tested with the following web browsers, CommonJS environments, and JavaScript engines. Web Browsers Windows Internet Explorer, version 6.0 and higher Google Chrome, version 19.0 and higher Mozilla Firefox, version 2.0 and higher Apple Safari, version 3.0 and higher Opera 8.54 and higher SeaMonkey 1.0 and higher CommonJS Environments Node 0.6.21 and higher io.js 1.0.3 and higher RingoJS 0.9 and higher Narwhal 0.3.2 JavaScript Engines Mozilla Rhino 1.7R3 and higher WebKit JSC Google V8 Known Incompatibilities Attempting to serialize the arguments object may produce inconsistent results across environments due to specification version differences. As a workaround, please convert the arguments object to an array first: JSON.stringify([].slice.call(arguments, 0)). Required Native Methods JSON 3 assumes that the following methods exist and function as described in the ECMAScript specification: The Number, String, Array, Object, Date, SyntaxError, and TypeError constructors.

Apr 5, 2016 package.json Always use the newest version of gulp and CC Apr 5, 2016 README.md BitSet.js BitSet.js is a infinite Bit-Array implementation in JavaScript. That means that if you invert a bit vector, the leading ones get remembered. As far as I can tell, BitSet.js is the only library which has this feature. It is also heavily benchmarked against other implementations and is the fastest implementation to date. NOTE: As of version v4.0.0, BitSet.js is mutable, which means that the object gets changed by method invocations. In order to work on explicit copies, use clone(). Examples Basic usage var bs = new BitSet; bs.set(128, 1); // Set bit at position 128 console.log(bs.toString(16)); // Print out a hex dump with one bit set Flipping bits var bs = new BitSet; bs   .flip(0, 62)   .flip(29, 35);  var str = bs.toString();  if (str === ""111111111111111111111111111000000011111111111111111111111111111"") {    console.log(""YES!""); } Range Set var bs = new BitSet; bs.setRange(10, 18, 1); // Set a 1 between 10 and 18, inclusive User permissions If you want to store user permissions in your database and use BitSet for the bit twiddling, you can start with the following Linux-style snippet: var P_READ  = 2; // Bit pos var P_WRITE = 1; var P_EXEC  = 0;  var user = new BitSet; user.set(P_READ); // Give read perms user.set(P_WRITE); // Give write perms  var group = new BitSet(P_READ); var world = new BitSet(P_EXEC);  console.log(""0"" + user.toString(8) + group.toString(8) + world.toString(8)); Installation npm install --save bitset.js  or bower install bitset.js  Using BitSet.js with the browser <script src=""bitset.js""></script> <script>     console.log(BitSet(""111"")); </script> Using BitSet.js with require.js <script src=""require.js""></script> <script> requirejs(['bitset.js'], function(BitSet) {     console.log(BitSet(""1111"")); }); </script> Parser The parser accepts the following types of values in either function Strings Binary strings ""010101"" Binary strings with prefix ""0b100101"" Hexadecimal strings with prefix ""0xaffe"" Arrays The values of the array are the indizes to be set to 1 Uint8Array A binary representation in 8 bit form Number A binary value BitSet A BitSet object, which get copied over Functions The data type Mixed can be either a BitSet object, a String or an integer representing a native bitset with 31 bits. BitSet set(ndx[, value=0) Sets value 0 or 1 to index ndx of the betset int get(int ndx) Gets the value at index ndx BitSet setRange(from, to[, value=1]) Helper function for set, to set an entire range to a given value BitSet clear([from[, to]) Sets a portion of a given bitset to zero If no param is given, the whole bitset gets cleared If one param is given, the bit at this index gets cleared If two params are given, the range is cleared BitSet slice([from[, to]) Extracts a portion of a given bitset as a new bitset If no param is given, the bitset is getting cloned If one param is given, the index is used as offset If two params are given, the range is returned as new BitSet BitSet flip([from[, to]) Toggles a portion of a given bitset If no param is given, the bitset is inverted If one param is given, the bit at the index is toggled If two params are given, the bits in the given range are toggled BitSet not() Calculates the bitwise not BitSet and(Mixed x) Calculates the bitwise and between two bitsets BitSet or(Mixed x) Calculates the bitwise or between two bitsets BitSet xor(Mixed x) Calculates the bitwise xor between two bitsets BitSet andNot(Mixed x) Calculates the bitwise andNot between two bitsets (this is not the nand operation!) BitSet clone() Clones the actual object Array toArray() Returns an array with all indexes set in the bitset String toString([base=2]) Returns a string representation with respect to the base int cardinality() Calculates the number of bits set int msb() Calculates the most significant bit (the left most) int ntz() Calculates the number of trailing zeros (zeros on the right) int lsb() Calculates the least significant bit (the right most) bool isEmpty() Checks if the bitset has all bits set to zero bool equals() Checks if two bitsets are the same BitSet.fromBinaryString(str) Alternative constructor to pass with a binary string BitSet.fromHexString(str) Alternative constructor to pass a hex string Coding Style As every library I publish, bitset.js is also built to be as small as possible after compressing it with Google Closure Compiler in advanced mode. Thus the coding style orientates a little on maxing-out the compression rate. Please make sure you keep this style if you plan to extend the library. Build the library Gulp is optional for minifying with Google Closure Compiler.

You can also view the documentation. Does my Device Support the API? The vibration API is implemented in navigator.vibrate. So calling the function makes your phone vibrate. You can test if your browser is recent enough to have the vibrate function in navigator. Mozilla had their own implementation mozVibrate so some browsers may support that instead. var canVibrate = ""vibrate"" in navigator || ""mozVibrate"" in navigator;  if (canVibrate && !(""vibrate"" in navigator))     navigator.vibrate = navigator.mozVibrate; However, this doesn't mean that your device can vibrate. Just that it's recent enough. There are a few requirements you need to meet. You need the hardware for it. The page needs to be visible. Browser-specific implementation prevents the vibration. Usage jquery.vibrate.js You can embed using bower with bower install jquery.vibrate.js. Or you can download the zip file and extract the build/jquery/* files. The javascript files are located in build/jquery/jquery.vibrate.min.js. Download and embed the code then initialize in one of the following ways. // Vibration for 50ms on all .button on click $("".button"").vibrate();  // Vibrate for 20ms on click $("".button"").vibrate(""short"");  // Vibrate for 50ms on click $("".button"").vibrate(""medium""); $("".button"").vibrate(""default""); $("".button"").vibrate(50);  // Vibrate for 100ms on click $("".button"").vibrate(""long"");  // Vibrate for 40ms on touchstart $("".button"").vibrate({     duration: 40,     trigger: ""touchstart"" });  // Vibrate twice $("".button"").vibrate({     pattern: [20, 200, 20] });  Development I'm using grunt and node for building the docs.

MixItUp is a jQuery plugin providing animated filtering and sorting. MixItUp is great for managing any categorized or ordered content like portfolios, galleries and blogs, but can also function as a powerful tool for engaging application UI and data-visualisation. Why MixItUp? MixItUp plays nice with your existing HTML and CSS, making it a great choice for responsive layouts. Rather than using absolute positioning to control layout, MixItUp is designed to work with your existing inline-flow layout. Want to use percentages, media queries, inline-block, or even flex box? No problem! Basic Overview For a getting started guide, tutorials, documentation and support, please visit the MixItUp website at mixitup.kunkalabs.com A typical MixItUp workflow looks like this: HTML Build your container: <div id=""Container"">     <div class=""mix category-1"" data-my-order=""1""> ... </div>     <div class=""mix category-1"" data-my-order=""2""> ... </div>     <div class=""mix category-2"" data-my-order=""3""> ... </div>     <div class=""mix category-2"" data-my-order=""4""> ... </div> </div> MixItUp targets elements with the class mix inside a container. Categories for filtering are added as classes, and sort attributes are added as custom data attributes. Build your filter controls: <button class=""filter"" data-filter="".category-1"">Category 1</button> <button class=""filter"" data-filter="".category-2"">Category 2</button> Filtering happens when filter buttons are clicked. Build your sort controls: <button class=""sort"" data-sort=""my-order:asc"">Ascending Order</button> <button class=""sort"" data-sort=""my-order:desc"">Descending Order</button> Sorting happens when sort buttons are clicked. CSS Hide target elements: #Container .mix{     display: none; } In your project's stylesheet, set the display property of target elements to none. MixItUp will show only those elements which match the current filter. JS Instantiate MixItUp on your container using jQuery: $(function(){     $('#Container').mixItUp(); }); Using our container's ID, we can instantiate MixItUp with the jQuery method .mixItUp() Full Documentation Configuration Object API Methods State Object Events Version 1 Migration Guide A much prettier version of the full documentation is also available at mixitup.kunkalabs.com/docs ChangeLog ChangeLog Licenses For use in commercial projects and products we require that you purchase a commercial license.

Support & Bugs Support forums are provided at mixitup.kunkalabs.com/support We ask that all general support questions and issues are posted there and that GitHub issues be used only for bug-related issues. All non-bug-related issues posted to GitHub will be closed without comment. Please be patient while we respond to your questions as we have very limited resources. The support forum is provided as a courtesy to MixItUp users so that knowledge can be shared – support is not guaranteed. Please be as detailed as possible when posting. If you can include a link to your project, a CodePen or JSFiddle demo, or a even just a code snippet of your setup, it is much more likely your question will be answered quickly and correctly. Do not email KunkaLabs with support questions. All support emails will be ignored. If you think you’ve found a bug we encourage you to submit a GitHub Issue rather than posting in the support forums. This way we can keep bugs tracked efficiently and hopefully fix them swiftly. When submitting a bug report please provide as much details as possible about your development environment, browser and OS, and the expected vs. resulting behaviour. Please also include any console errors that arise. If you can pinpoint the erroneous code even better.

A jQuery plugin built on top of the GridList class that translates the generic items positions into responsive DOM elements with drag and drop capabilities. GridList class Jump to: API Primitives API new GridList(items, options) var myGrid = new GridList(items, {   direction: 'horizontal',   lanes: 3 }); The first constructor parameter is an array of items to populate the grid with. Supported options: direction - Can be 'horizontal' or 'vertical'. Defaults to 'horizontal'. This sets how the grid can expand e.g. for 'horizontal' the grid will stretch towards the right to accommodate all the items. For 'vertical', it will stretch towards the bottom. lanes - Number of fixed rows or columns, depending on the direction. generateGrid() myGrid.generateGrid(); Build the grid structure from scratch, using the positions of the given items. If items lack positional attributes (x and y), they will be misplaced, possibly overlapping. If you want to build a grid around a list of items that only have their size attributes defined (w and h), and rely on the library to position them two-dimensionally, use resizeGrid. resizeGrid(lanes) myGrid.resizeGrid(4); (Re)generate positions for the items inside a grid instance for a given number of rows/columns. This method has two major use-cases: Items are being represented two-dimensionally for the first time. Items already have 2d positions but need to be represented on a different grid size, maintaining as much as possible of their previous order. Positions inside the grid are generated left-to-right, top-to-bottom. So when looking for a new position inside the grid the topmost row from the leftmost column is chosen. moveItemToPosition(item, position) // Move item from [0, 0] to [1, 1] var carefreeItem = myGrid.grid[0][0]; myGrid.moveItemToPosition(carefreeItem, [1, 1]); Here are things that happen when moving an item inside the grid: The item's previous position is cleared inside the 2d grid, The position inside the item object is updated, The item's new position is marked inside the 2d grid and Collisions are handled if the moved item overlaps with other item(s) from the grid. Collisions can be solved in two ways. First, an attempt to resolve them locally is made, meaning that the moved item tries to swap position with the overlapped item(s). This is the preferred fair trade. If this doesn't work out and after swapping we still have collisions inside the grid, the entire grid will be regenerated, starting with the moved item fixed in its new position. In the latter case, all the items around and to the right of the moved item might have their position slightly altered. resizeItem(item, size) // Resize item from position [0, 0] to span over 3 columns var growthItem = myGrid.grid[0, 0];  myGrid.resizeItem(growthItem, {w: 3}); console.log(growthItem.w); // will output ""3""  myGrid.resizing(growthItem, {h: 2}); console.log(growthItem.h); // will output ""2"" Resizing an item is very similar to moving its position, in the sense that grid cells will be repopulated and collisions will be handled afterwards. See moveItemToPosition. Primitives Item The item is the building block of GridList, and is a plain JavaScript object. The primary function of the GridList is to position such items two-dimentionally. Which brings us to the composition of an item: w and h for size, x and y for position. E.g. {w: 3, h: 1, x: 0, y: 1} Note that x and y (column and row) are abstract coords inside the grid, they are integer values starting from 0. Naturally, w and h (width and height) also take up space in the same coordinate system, which reveals the smallest unit of a grid: the cell. You could say, for example, that the featured item above takes up three grid cells. gridList.items A GridList instance works around an array of items. The items array is the first parameter of the class constructor and is always visible under the .items property. Here's a list of items for a grid with three 1x1 items on a column with three rows: [{w: 1, h: 1, x: 0, y: 0},  {w: 1, h: 1, x: 0, y: 1},  {w: 1, h: 1, x: 0, y: 2}] gridList.grid Seeing how JavaScript doesn't support multidimensional arrays, the 2d grid inside GridList is represented by an array for columns, with each array entry containing another array with cells for each row. The cell is simply a pointer to an item that occupies it, or a null reference if no item is sitting on that cell's position. Note that more cells can point to the same item reference, because items occupy w * h cells. Here's a grid pseudo-representation: col1 col2 col3 col4 1 2 1 3 4 4 1 4 4 Having the grid in a two-dimensional data structure, we can fetch item references directly by targeting any of the cells they cover inside the grid. E.g. myGrid.grid[1][0] // reference to item #2 myGrid.grid[1][1] // reference to item #3 myGrid.grid[2][1] // reference to item #4 myGrid.grid[3][2] // still reference to item #4 PS. This grid would be generated by these items: [{w: 1, h: 3, x: 0, y: 0},  {w: 1, h: 1, x: 1, y: 0},  {w: 1, h: 1, x: 1, y: 1},  {w: 2, h: 2, x: 2, y: 1}] $.fn.gridList $('.my-list').gridList({   direction: 'horizontal',   lanes: 3 }); The jQuery plugin has two main functions: Render the GridList on top of a list of DOM elements. The list items are expected to have data-w and data-h attributes, and optionally data-x and data-y (if their positions have been previously generated and persisted) Drag and drop capabilities The function takes an optional argument with options that will be passed to the draggables when constructing them. $('.my-list').gridList({lanes: 3}, {handle: '.title'}); See jQuery UI Draggable API for details on all the available options. The rendered list is responsive to its parent container, meaning that the width and height of the items are calculated based on the container height divided by the number of grid rows. FAQ: Why not gridster? Their README reads Ducksboard is no longer active in their development. There are a few notable forks but it's hard to assert their reliability. gridster works vertically while our solution works both vertically and horizontally. Our lib contains over 5 times fewer code. gridster collisions are very basic, we pushed towards better UX and found alternative ways for dealing with collisions. We wanted out-of-the-box responsiveness, and the entire grid system was build fluid, relative to any parent container. We needed the grid logic to be a DOM-less lib outside the jQuery plugin. This allows us to compute grid positions on the server-side and run kick-ass fast tests with Node. Another more particular thing we needed was widgets that had height=0, which means they stretch on however many rows a grid has. We show timelines like this. It also works for width=0.

Install jQuery is required, so include it first. Download jquery.matchHeight.js and include the script in your HTML file: <script src=""jquery.matchHeight.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>  You can also install using the package managers Bower and NPM. bower install matchheight npm install jquery-match-height  Usage $(function() {     $('.item').matchHeight(options); });  Where options is an optional parameter. See below for a description of the available options and defaults. The above example will set all selected elements with the class item to the height of the tallest. If the items are on multiple rows, the items of each row will be set to the tallest of that row (see byRow option). Call this on the DOM ready event (the plugin will automatically update on window load). See the included test.html for many working examples. Also see the Data API below for a simple, alternative inline usage. Options The default options are: {     byRow: true,     property: 'height',     target: null,     remove: false }  Where: byRow is true or false to enable row detection property is the CSS property name to set (e.g. 'height' or 'min-height') target is an optional element to use instead of the element with maximum height remove is true or false to remove previous bindings instead of applying new ones Data API Use the data attribute data-mh=""group-name"" where group-name is an arbitrary string to identify which elements should be considered as a group. <div data-mh=""my-group"">My text</div> <div data-mh=""my-group"">Some other text</div> <div data-mh=""my-other-group"">Even more text</div> <div data-mh=""my-other-group"">The last bit of text</div>  All elements with the same group name will be set to the same height when the page is loaded, regardless of their position in the DOM, without any extra code required. Note that byRow will be enabled when using the data API, if you don't want this (or require other options) then use the alternative method above. Advanced Usage There are some additional functions and properties you should know about: Manually trigger an update $.fn.matchHeight._update()  If you need to manually trigger an update of all currently set groups, for example if you've modified some content. Row detection You can toggle row detection by setting the byRow option, which defaults to true. It's also possible to use the row detection function at any time: $.fn.matchHeight._rows($('.item'));  Which will return an array of element selections for each row, see this thread for more information and an example. Remove bindings $('.item').matchHeight({ remove: true });  This will remove all bindings for the selected elements, from all groups. Custom target element $(function() {     $('.item').matchHeight({         target: $('.sidebar')     }); });  Will set all selected elements to the height of the first item with class sidebar. Custom property $('.item').matchHeight({ property: 'min-height' });  This will set the min-height property instead of the height property. Callback events Since matchHeight automatically handles updating the layout after certain window events, you can supply functions as global callbacks if you need to be notified: $.fn.matchHeight._beforeUpdate = function(event, groups) {     // do something before any updates are applied }  $.fn.matchHeight._afterUpdate = function(event, groups) {     // do something after all updates are applied }  Where event a jQuery event object (e.g. load, resize, orientationchange) and groups is a reference to $.fn.matchHeight._groups (see below). Manually apply match height $.fn.matchHeight._apply(elements, options)  Use the apply function directly if you wish to avoid the automatic update functionality. Throttling resize updates $.fn.matchHeight._throttle = 80;  By default, the _update method is throttled to execute at a maximum rate of once every 80ms. Decreasing the above _throttle property will update your layout quicker, appearing smoother during resize, at the expense of performance. If you experience lagging or freezing during resize, you should increase the _throttle property. Maintain scroll position $.fn.matchHeight._maintainScroll = true;  Under certain conditions where the size of the page is dynamically changing, such as during resize or when adding new elements, browser bugs cause the page scroll position to change unexpectedly. If you are observing this behaviour, use the above line to automatically attempt to force scroll position to be maintained (approximately). This is a global setting and by default it is false. Accessing current group bindings $.fn.matchHeight._groups  The array that contains all element groups that have had matchHeight applied. Used internally for automatically updating on resize events, but you may modify this array if you need to manually access any groups (e.g. if you're deleting elements). Tests Open test/page/test.html in your browser to run unit tests via the jasmine test runner. If you wish to contribute functionality to this project, you are encouraged to add new tests following the same conventions. Run gulp test to run unit tests on multiple browsers and multiple resolutions, automatically through selenium. Run gulp test:cloud to test on even more browsers via a cloud service (you will need to create a file called test/conf/private.conf.js with your cloud credentials that looks like this: exports.config = {     user: 'username',     key: 'key' };  Cloud browser testing for this project is provided by BrowserStack (which is free for open source). Known limitations CSS transitions and animations are not supported You should ensure that there are no transitions or other animations that will delay the height changes of the elements you are matching, including any transition: all rules. Otherwise the plugin will produce unexpected results, as animations can't be accounted for. Delayed webfonts may cause incorrect height Some browsers do not wait for webfonts to load before firing the window load event, so if the font loads too slowly the plugin may produce unexpected results. If this is a problem, you should call _update once your font has loaded by using something like the webfontloader script. Content changes require a manual update If you change the content inside an element that has had matchHeight applied, then you must manually call $.fn.matchHeight._update() afterwards. This will update of all currently set equal heights groups. Also note that previous matchHeight bindings do not apply to new elements, even if they match the selector used. In this case you must remove the old bindings and add new ones, see this comment.
